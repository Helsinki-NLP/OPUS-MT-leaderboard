MG Baltic Case: New Gustain Lawyer Says He Hasn't Forecasted The Case
The eleventh MG Baltic case court hearing on Monday met all the accused: Sharon Gustain, Gintar Steponavi<0xC4><0x8D>ius, Vytautas Gab<0xC5><0xA1>is, Eligius Masiulis and Raimonda Kurlianskis.
The trial began with the demonstrations of the accused.
At the last court hearing, the new state-appointed lawyer Aleksandr Doroshev told the jury that he had not yet anticipated access to the case material.
At the time, MG Baltic lawyer Lina Belevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius stated that in order to ensure full personal protection, the College of Lawyers must allow the new lawyer to access the material of the case and asked for a court hearing.
"In order to ensure the protection of a person, he must familiarize himself with the material of the criminal case.
It’s not just a formal meeting,” Belevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius said.
The new lawyer, A. Doroshev, noted that he had not been able to get acquainted with the indictment, nor with all the material of the case.
In the previous court hearing, the suspect, Mr. Gustaini, reported the resignation of his lawyer because he will no longer be able to pay him.
Audio recordings were also heard during the session.
The lawyers of the accused were outraged that the audio recordings presented to the court were of poor quality.
The law enforcement suspects that politicians, when taking the leaflets from MG Baltic, supported or initiated favourable decisions in the Seima and other public institutions, and also influenced the decision of the winners of public procurement, recalls ELTA.
The survey interviewed more than 150 people, of whom more than 50 were past members of the Seimas and several former ministers, members of the European Parliament.
More than 200 surveys have been conducted and more than 30 times.
Gustain is suspected of receiving more than 8,000 euros, Steponavi<0xC4><0x8D>ius - 15,000 euros, Gap<0xC5><0xA1>ys - more than 27,000 E. Masiulis is suspected of taking more than 106,000 euros.
The Labour Party is suspected of bribery and trade influences, the Liberal Movement is suspected of bribery, trade influences and abuses, and MG Baltic is suspected of bribery and trade influences of these parties.
Politicians are suspected to have consulted with MG Baltic Vice President Kurlianski and later proposed or supported initiatives in favour of the group in Seima or other institutions.
Ethics guards: Liberal Movement Board on the right to act in Vilnius
"The decisions taken by the government are in accordance with the statutes," said Vytautas Tamomi<0xC5><0xA1>i<0xC5><0xAB>nas, the head of the BNS after the committee meeting.
“This decision was not something new to us.
We had already made an explanation as a commission in July, when the question of the Skills and the Utenas was raised.
We then said that under the statutes, this is a matter of the competence of the Board.
And if the board decides that any department can act as it pleases, - go with the committee and the board agrees, then the department can go, but if the board decides that there will be party lists everywhere, what the board and has adopted, this is a decision for the whole party.
And if it does not agree with the board, then there is an opportunity to suspend membership and go with the committee," he added.
According to Tamomiyun, the party’s board will now decide on further action.
On October 17, the Liberal Movement Board of the Party annulled the decision of the municipality of Vilnius to take part in the municipal elections, not with the party, but with the newly created electoral committee.
In the opinion of the party board, the decision of the liberals of the capital to participate in the elections in the form of a public election committee violated the party’s statutes, decisions of the board.
By 31 October, the Vilnius section had to cancel the aspirations to participate in municipal elections with the committee list.
But the department did not.
Former head of the department, parliamentary Austrian Armonite has already withdrawn from the Liberal movement.
The Mayor of Vilnius, former President of the Liberal Movement Remigius <0xC5><0xA0>ima<0xC5><0xA1>ius, promising to hold another chairmanship in the capital, has already presented the team and the ideas of the Public Election Committee "For Vilnius, we are proud of!"
He also left the party.
Elections of municipal councils and mayors will take place in March next year.
Residents of a village in northern India drove a tiger who had previously killed a man by tractor, officials said on Monday.
Mahavira Kaud<0xC5><0xBE>lagis, a forest guard, said the tigers surrounded a man working in the fields late on Sunday, surrounded the villagers and, trying to get out, drove him by tractor.
Residents say the tiger also attacked and stabbed a young man about 10 days ago.
The small village is located in the Tiger Confederation of Dudhva in Lakhympur Kher district, about 250 km southeast of the capital of the state of Utar Pradesh, Laknau.
Tigers are not allowed to live in protected areas.
Deputy Director Ramesha Pandey said that the case will be reported to the police under the Wildlife Protection Act.
In April, villagers massacred another tiger in the Nigasan district of Uttar Pradesh, where he suffered serious injuries.
The tiger is the national animal of India; under the Wildlife Conservation Act, tigers are considered to be a perishable species.
Last year’s government figures show that at least one person was killed every day during clashes with wild tigers or dragons in the previous three years.
Human conflicts with tigers have been increasing gradually since the 1980s, when India launched a tiger protection program that established detentions in national parks and the killing of large cats began to be considered a crime.
Although tiger computing methods have changed, the census shows that the population of about 1,800 tigers at the time increased to 2,226 individuals in 2014.
Suggested for cats and dogs to be labelled with microchips
K<0xC4><0x99>stutis Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eika, Chairman of the Seimas Environmental Protection Committee, together with the other Seimas members, registered amendments to the Animal Welfare and Protection Act, which proposes that cats and dogs be labelled with sub-microchemicals.
"We propose that cats and dogs are required to be labelled with sub-microchemicals, and their registration and labelling are organised by local municipalities, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Service.
In 2019, all dogs will be labeled free of charge with state funds, and in 2020 - even cats, so there will be no concerns for the population and the costs will be covered by specially planned state funding," said K<0xC4><0x99>stutis Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eika, chairman of the Seimas Committee on Environmental Protection.
The amendments to the law aim to address the systematic need for labelling of pets.
This is expected to help avoid problems caused by irresponsible breeders, illegal breeders or sellers.
It is preliminary estimated that the expected average price of the microsystem and service, which will be around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5, will be reimbursed for all pet owners during the transitional period.
The total cost of labelling of all pets can reach up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 million.
It is planned that the need for these funds will be allocated within three years and will reach <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2 million per year.
It is expected that the funds for labelling programmes will be allocated through the Municipality Environmental Support Special Programme, whose revenues will increase significantly this year due to the increased taxation of natural resources and the redistribution of funds.
These funds will be used by municipalities not only for the labelling of cats and dogs, but also for castration and other programs.
According to Mr Ma<0xC5><0xBE>ek, compulsory labelling practices are common in almost all countries of the European Union, this allows for the protection of the animals themselves (because they can easily be returned to their owners), and saves time for the breeders themselves, when the fugitive and the deceased breeder is there.
In addition, EU legislation provides that travel is only possible with labelled pets.
At the same time, the labelling obliges to take responsible care of the animal for the rest of its life.
Previous proposals for mandatory labelling were called for resistance, as the relevant programmes were offered to finance with population funds.
"The present model should avoid these criticisms, as animal protection is proposed to be financed with increased income from the environmental support programme and the right to labelling, not only for veterinarians, but also for public projects, i.e. for the authors of the animal care academy"
The bill was registered by a group of members representing different Seimas groups - K<0xC4><0x99>stutis Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eika, Algimantas Dumbrava, Eugenijus Gentvilas, Edmund Pupinis, Rim Andrikis, Antanas Vinkus and others.
Thirteen members of Afghan government forces killed in Taliban attack in eastern Afghanistan
A spokesman for the provincial governor, Arif Noori, said seven soldiers and six police officers were killed.
He added that during the joint military and police control post in the Chogjani district, four more soldiers were injured.
According to Noori, six fighters were killed in a three-hour battle with Afghan forces and another ten Taliban were wounded.
A Taliban spokesman for the press Zabihullah Mujahida said in a statement that the movement took responsibility for Monday's attack on Gaza.
Noori said this post was set up two days ago in a strategically important area to take off the Taliban supply route.
During the attack, the posts were completely destroyed.
"Ritsa" leaned his hand to the Ukrainian club
On Wednesday, the fourth round of the FIBA European Cup match will be held at the Rita Arena in Vilnius, where Kosovo and Ukraine will meet.
Dvikova will be held in the capital for political reasons.
The Cherkasy Mavpy and Pristina KB Prishtina teams will be welcomed on November 7th in Vilnius under their roof in the Rita arena.
"For political reasons between Kosovo and Ukraine, we were unable to hold this match at home, so we are very happy that our friends from Vilnius agreed to welcome us," Ukrainian team head coach Maxim Michelson said.
"We have a lot of friends in Vilnius, and our countries always agree well with each other.
Lithuania is one of the best countries in the world with basketball traditions, so it will be a real honour to play here.
We hope that we will get support from the whales.
The Kosovo team could not come to Ukraine because these countries do not have any diplomatic relations.
Currently, after the first round, the Ukrainian team is in third place with one win over three matches, while the Kosovo team is in second place and has more wins.
This will be a very important step for Group E, as only two teams will reach the next stage.
In the past, Vilnius was also held in the Ukrainian-Kosovo national team in the 2017 European Basketball Championship.
The victory was won by the Ukrainian team at 100:61.
Basketball fans will be able to access the matches free of charge on Wednesday, and the start of the match is 19:00.
'Women Lie Better' star B. Arsobait's lyrics
Probably it’s just a coincidence, but the charming brown actress Brigita Arsobait<0xC4><0x97> already receives roles for the lie a few times.
Initially the series "Women Lie Better", then the show "Melanie" and finally the comedy "Melanie".
In this film, Brigita plays the square wife of Dainius Kazlausko's hero.
"I really liked filming in Melagios, because I'm more a theatre actress and I rarely appeared in cinema.
A wonderful team of colleagues has promised a great result from the very beginning.
This experience is very important and valuable to me.
But the most interesting thing that happened in the square was the puppy Sunny!
All my life I thought that if I had a dog, it would certainly be big and serious.
I've never admired those small, decorative "fifs" foursomes.
But during the filming Sunny got so close to me that the sympathy became mutual and I finally even stopped buying it from the hostess, but it was unsuccessful,” she smiled.
The new Lithuanian comedy "Melagiai" produced by the Lithuanian film hits "Unexperienced" and "Between us, boys..." has been introduced to the comic and intriguing peripeti of family members from the first minutes.
Your lover just told me she's waiting.
It would be great news, but... your lover is your brother's wife!
But that's not all.
Unable to announce the "good news" to everyone, parents unexpectedly declare - they are different!
After 50 years together...
And all this happens just before the most beautiful holiday of the year - Christmas!
But the end will be even more surprising, because no one expected such a nuclear power plant.
Not all heroes are what they looked like at first glance.
In addition to the comedy of B. Arsobaita, "Melagiai" will give four movie stars Giedrius Savickas, Dainius Kazlauskas, Edita U<0xC5><0xBE>ait<0xC4><0x97>, Giedr<0xC4><0x97> Giedraityt<0xC4><0x97>, Liubomiras Laucevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius, Larisa Kalpokaait<0xC4><0x97> and Gedi.
Comedy "Melagia" - in China from November 9th.
Decides to deduct <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million of unpaid taxes on migrants
The Seimas on Tuesday agreed to consider the amendment to the Law on the Declaration of Residence prepared by "State" leader Ram<0xC5><0xAB>n Karbauski.
By 56 votes in favour, 9 against and 25 abstentions.
Further consideration of the amendments will be undertaken by the Seimas on or after 6 December following the conclusions of the Government.
According to R. Karbauski, these contributions are calculated for people who have not declared leaving Lithuania.
According to the parliamentarian, in three years one person does not pay about 1 thousand euros, and now there are about 100,000 such persons.
Social-Democrat Algirdas Syss regretted that in this way, the Seimas would "remember the obligation" to declare the exit and then no taxes would be calculated.
Member of the Committee on Health, Conservative Antan Matulas noted that Lithuanians living abroad are benefiting from the fact that, by paying a small health insurance fee, they come to Lithuania for treatment - they are given the same services as paying this student.
The amendments provide that persons who leave Lithuania will be deemed to be those who pay social insurance contributions in the European Union, in the European Economic Area or in the Swiss Confederation, and "Sodra" will be exempted from the payment of health insurance contributions in Lithuania.
Sodros leader Mindaugas Sinkevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius has previously said that such a move will facilitate both the lives of emigrated people and the activities of Sodros.
Video of a slipping bear on the internet reveals a serious problem
Nude as a mother's beak sticks a straight snowed slope, and the little one still sticks, slipping down again and again, persistently copying.
The video received a lot of reviews and comments.
People were fascinated by the stubbornness of the small arch - repeatedly slid down, he looked back at his mother.
He does not succeed at first, but the little one does not try to give up and finally reaches his goal.
The video really paid attention, but it also reveals the threat that humans pose to animals.
Scientists argue that it is also necessary to talk about the fact that people’s desire to learn about wildlife can sometimes be harmful.
"I'm sure the drones were frightened.
Their movements show that they are panicking.
If the drones weren’t smuggled into the environment, they would probably have chosen a safer path or beat it slower or more cautiously.
This is a great example of how drones should not be used," Ecologist Mark Ditmer told The Verge.
A while ago, Mr. Ditmer and his colleagues investigated how drones operate in bows.
The animals were equipped with heart rate gauges.
When the drone was approaching, some sharks would run away, others would not run anywhere, but all their hearts began to cry more frequently from fear.
Scientists advise the animals to use drones for filming responsibly, not to crash too close, not to make noise, and not to disperse where it is forbidden.
The fugitive was contacted by the newspaper.
A court in Kiev on Tuesday invited deposed President Viktor Yanukovych to attend the trial on his alleged treason of the state in an unusual manner, the call was published in the state's official newspaper.
In a court appeal, published in the government knowledge journal Uriadovoj kurjer, the former leader is invited to attend the November 19 criminal trial session, during which his final arguments could be heard.
The document states that Mr Yanukovych has the right to attend the video session.
On October 30, the Kiev court announced the conclusion of the debate in the case of V. Yanukovych.
Aleksandr Goro<0xC5><0xA1>inski, a lawyer working in Russia, was given the opportunity to register in the foreign lawyers’ register by November 19, in order to attend the meeting, where Mr. Yanukovych is expected to have a video connection with his father.
Kremlin-backed Yanukovych was overthrown and fled to Russia during the Maidan uprising in February 2014, triggered by the president’s refusal to sign an association treaty with the European Union.
Russian President Vladimir Putin later revealed that the former leader of Ukraine was deported to Russia through a special operation organized by Moscow.
In March of that year, Russia annexed the Crimea peninsula, which belongs to Ukraine, and a little later there was a war in the east of the country between Kiev and Russian-backed separatists.
Since then, the fighting has killed about 10,000 people, despite many attempts by the international community to secure a long-term ceasefire.
List of Conservatives in Vilnius City Council by Valdas Benkunskas
Former Minister of Economy Dainius Kreivys has been approved as a Conservative candidate for the year.
During the conservative elections this weekend, the party members ranked the list of candidates for the Vilnius City Council.
According to the party, V. Benkunskas, chairman of the TS-LKD Vilnius section conference, became the leader of the Conservative list.
The first ten candidates were Paul<0xC4><0x97> Kuzmickien<0xC4><0x97>, Adam Bu<0xC5><0xBE>inskas, Gediminas <0xC5><0xA0>vilpa, Audrius Skastys, Rasa Ba<0xC5><0xA1>kien<0xC4><0x97>, former Seimas member Liut<0xC4><0x97>s Kazlavickas Man<0xC4><0x97>skas, and the Young Conservatives of Karazijn<0xC4><0x97>s Val<0xC4><0x97>n<0xC4><0x97>s.
The direct elections of mayors and municipal councils in Lithuania will be held on March 3 of next year.
Limitations of cogeneration power plants are appealed to the Constitutional Court
The Seimas opposition, as promised, appealed to the Constitutional Court (KT) the decision of the rulings to adopt a law on the possibility of stopping the construction of waste incineration plants.
On Tuesday, the opposition Party of the National Union of Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) of the Seimas reported that a group of Seimas members had appealed to the KT, requesting to investigate the conformity of the Amendments to the Law on Waste Management adopted by the rulings.
"Parliaments underline that the provisions of the law aim at quoting projects of waste incineration facilities already underway, ordering the Government to impose new restrictions (20 km distance from the residential area) before the entry into force of the law in Vilnius - Raikeshö - Raikeshö
"Parliaments point out that, in the light of the nature of the energy, the concept of which the prohibition on the construction of waste is inherent in the whole of the law, and the prohibition on the construction of objects of state importance (i.e., the definition of distance, even the concept of "residential", the concept of "residential", the concept of "residential", or the conclusion that this prohibition is not inherent in any state"
The appeal states that the law adopted is contrary to the constitutional principle of the rule of law.
“The WTO has repeatedly stated that the legislation does not apply to the legal facts and consequences that occurred before the newly adopted act came into force.
In this case, the Government is empowered to reverse the law, according to an indefinite criterion.
When such a legal regulation is established, the principles of constitutional legal certainty, legal certainty, protection of legitimate expectations, hence the constitutional principle of the rule of law, are violated.
It also notes that large financial investments have already been made in the projects of Vilnius and Kaunas cogeneration plants.
If the current projects were suspended, the state would suffer not only hundreds of millions of financial losses, massive losses and the Lithuanian population would increase heating prices, as a result of the increasing waste disposal in the landfills, increased environmental pollution.
The call was signed by the members of the Seimas TS-LKD, the Liberal Movement, the Social Democrats and the senior deputy of the ruling Socialist Labour Group, Algirdas Butkevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius.
A couple of weeks ago, Seimas was able to gather 71 votes by the ruling party to reject the amendments to the Waste Management Act adopted by President Dalia Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97>s veto, which provides for the right to block the construction of the government's 20-year-olds, which have already started to cogenerate.
The revised amendments to the Seimas Act will enter into force on 1 January 2019. The truth is that the governors are already proposing to give up the 20 km restriction.
This proposal is expected to be discussed at the autumn session of the Seimas.
However, the government’s right to suspend projects that have already been initiated is not planned.
The KT will examine this case in a row - no earlier than a year later.
Asking questions about LeBron James's statistics at the Lakers Club
The start of LeBron James’s career at the Los Angeles Lakers is not what he expected, the organization and the basketball fans.
The Lakers began the season with four wins and six losses, and such a weak start helped make the move due to possible coach Luke Walton's dismissal.
However, such speeches were calmed by Basketball Operations President Magic Johnson, stating that the coach will not forgive, but play better.
The team's biggest star, L. James, should also turn to himself.
While the attacker's statistics are usually impressive - 26.8 points, 7.6 rebounds of the ball and 7.7 results.
But she doesn’t tell the whole truth.
During the first ten games of the season, other figures showed that the Lakers are playing better when there is no L. James on the pitch.
Pole negatives <0x2B>/- statistics, showing how many more points the team injects or loses when there are certain players on the pitch.
That’s when L. James is on the pitch, the Lakers spent 30 more points this season than the competitors.
When he sat on the ground, the "earth" earned 19 points more than the competitors.
Currently, the Lakers are only 13th at the Western Conference, but a few wins can turn everything upside down.
Spain will continue to contribute to the protection of Lithuanian airspace
The meeting noted that Spain will contribute to the protection of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia’s airspace in 2019 and 2020.
“Lithuania deeply appreciates Spain’s cooperation with NATO and its significant contribution to ensuring the security of our country and the region,” said Minister Linkevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius.
The Spanish Air Force has already carried out NATO air police and air police reinforcement missions in the Baltic States five times, three of them in Lithuania.
The last time the Spanish Eurofighter destroyers were deployed in the North during the months of May-August of this year.
In addition, Spain will contribute to the protection of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia’s airspace in 2019 and 2020.
The Minister also noted that regular consultations are taking place between Lithuania and Spain on security, political, economic and strategic communication in the fight against propaganda.
Mr Linkevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius expressed the hope that Lithuania and Spain will continue to work closely together on the European, transatlantic agenda and other multilateral issues.
Since 2004, when Spain opened its embassy in Vilnius, Ambassador Jose Maria Robles Fraga is the fifth representative of Spain in Lithuania.
On 29 October, José Maria Robles Fraga sent special letters to President Dalia Grybauskaite.
V. Achievement about the arrest of R. Achievement: I believe in the innocence of a man and the law enforcement
“It was the most unexpected thing I’ve ever thought of.
On the other hand, it is likely that the services are doing the work they are required to do.
We all do our job.
I believe in law enforcement, I believe in my husband that everything is fair and honest, that no unjust acts of his should be done," said BNS.
R. A<0xC4><0x8D>a was arrested by the Special Investigations Service (STT) on Monday - law enforcement suspects that he, while still the director of the administration of the Russian Municipality, took a high-value stipend, and could in return create exceptional conditions for the private company, after having signed an auto-contract.
Representatives of private enterprises are suspected of acquiring Mr. A<0xC4><0x8D>a directly or participating in the masking of octopus in various financial transactions.
R. A<0xC4><0x8D>a was discharged from office by the Council of the Municipality of Rasein district on the third test in April of this year after a manifest lack of confidence.
After the former "Order" became a member of the newly established Social Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania led by Gedimin Kirkilo in March this year, he suspended membership in this party on Monday.
Aziz, a few years ago, unsuccessfully ran for the mayoral election as a representative of the Election Committee "Your Race".
Akien<0xC4><0x97> says the man did not intend to run for mayor next year, but had not yet decided whether to take part in the municipal council elections.
V. A<0xC4><0x8D>ien<0xC4><0x97> was elected to the Seimas on the list of Lithuanian states and Greens, she is a member of the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission.
The politician says to jump in further law enforcement actions - and it will depend on whether she will step down from the work commission.
“I really don’t make a decision today, I think I’ll make a decision this week.
I will see if there is a need, what kind of accusations to be made, of course, I will make the same or the other decision.
I probably need to stay away from all the things that are being investigated in the Anti-Corruption Commission, but again - time will put everything in its place," she said.
The representative of the opposition conservatives, Seime Radvi<0xC4><0x97> Mork<0xC5><0xAB>nait<0xC4><0x97>-Mikuläniene<0xC4><0x97>, called on the president of the Seimas, Viktor Pranckiet<0xC4><0x97>, and the head of the "States" Ram<0xC5><0xAB>na Karbauska, to withdraw from the statements of his group colleague Vidas Achien<0xC4><0x97>s, and to withdraw from the anti-committe.
She argues that the further work of Mrs Acciene in the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission would "cause public mistrust and discredit the work of the important parliamentary oversight committee".
Sensitive "Coldplay" music dominates and famous Lithuanian pores
Many music and film lovers will be on the market for the pre-release of the film Coldplay: A Head Full of Dreams on Monday.
The event was attended by a group of famous people: John and Simona Naini, Ignas Lely, Martyn Tyla and many others.
The film tells the story of one of Britain’s most popular pop bands, Coldplay, which intersects with moments from the concerts.
Documentary director Matt Whitecross met the men of the group when they were still playing in bars and gathering just a few dozen spectators.
The film can be seen anywhere that has not been shown from backstage concerts, rehearsals or recreational activities.
Vocalist and pianist Chris Martin and guitarist Jonny Buckland met at college in 1996 and formed the band "Pectoralz".
Soon Boss Guy Berryman joined them, and a little later - and drummer Will Champion.
The band changed its name to "Coldplay" and just twenty years ago released their first recording "Safety", which included three works.
The majority of the 500 copies of the record were distributed to radio stations, producers and friends, and only 50 copies of Safety were sold.
Now Coldplay is a world-famous, respected and beloved band that has released seven albums that have sold more than 100 million copies.
Over the past two decades, the group has won 107 different awards, including nine Brit Awards and seven Grammys.
"Juventus" married V. <0xC4><0x8C>epukaitis - LKL MVP of the week
With a solid match at Betsafe-LKL, Utena Juventus high-scoring player Vaidas <0xC4><0x8C>epukaitis won the title of the most profitable player of the week.
The centre scored a double double, which helped the Juventus team to beat the Alytus Dukes basketball team by 86:77.
V.<0xC4><0x8C>epukaitis scored 13 points (5/6 draws) and scored 11 balls in nearly 31 injured minutes.
In addition, the high kick provoked 7 opponents' losses, took over 3 balls and made 4 successful transfers.
Such indicators guaranteed 30 utility points.
This season, V.<0xC4><0x8C>epukaitis scores 17.2 utility points and this is the best indicator of his career in the 11th season of the LKL.
Heavyweight is the fourth most profitable basketball player this season.
Together with V.<0xC4><0x8C>epu<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87>, the most beneficial five of the week were Martyn Gecevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius and K<0xC5><0xA1>istof Lavrinovi<0xC4><0x8D>ius (both - Prien<0xC5><0xB3> "Skycop"), Yannick Franke (Pasvalio "Milk Stars") and Jeri Grant (Klaip<0xC4><0x97>dos "Nept<0xC5><0xAB>nas").
It was only recently that the Pasvali team was supplemented by the legionnaire Y. Franke in the 88:93 losing game with Prienje Skycop, who scored 24 points, scored 10 balls and challenged 8 opponents, earning up to 31 utility points.
It is true that he was not allowed to become the most useful basketball player of the week by the team’s loss.
The defending chain on the fifth with the legionary of the Paswali team consists of his opponent of the day - the Prieni team representing M. Gecevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius.
He scored 19 points and scored 9 balls.
Such indicators guaranteed the sniper 26 profits.
Another Skycop basketball player can be seen in the high-scoring series - K.Lavrinovi<0xC4><0x8D>ius scored 15 points in Sunday matches (3/4 December, 9/11 penalty), provoked the loss of 7 opponents and scored 23 utility points.
In the fifth place was also a powerful match played by Klaip<0xC4><0x97>da "Neptuno" Attacker J. Grant.
The American scored 25 points in 25 minutes (10/11 Dec.), scored 4, took 3 balls, and thus accumulated 29 utility points.
Such a legionnaire's performance allowed the Klaipeda to triumph against the local "Eastern" 78:66.

Israelis shot dead in West Bank by Palestinian attacker with a knife
The military "has blocked the way for this attack because it identified a terrorist who tried to shoot civilians and an IDF (defence force) soldier," the Israeli army said in a statement on the incident near the Kiriath-Arbas settlement near Hebron.
“The warrior fired at the terrorist and neutralized him.
He was taken to the hospital.
“Israeli civilians and IDF soldiers were not injured,” the statement said.
A military spokeswoman told AFP that the attack was attempted by Palestinians.
After the incident, the video footage shows that he was not seriously injured.
A similar wave of Palestinian attacks began in 2015.
Such attacks have declined in recent years, but it is feared that a new wave of them may arise.
On October 22, a Palestinian man was shot and attacked a group of Jewish soldiers near Hebron with a knife.
Mushroom reading calls on China to create a more favourable investment environment for EU businesses
President Dalia Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97> calls on China to create a more favourable investment environment for investment in the European Union (EU) countries to facilitate foreign import conditions.
During the opening of the trade and investment forum at the China Import Exhibition in Shanghai, Mr. Grybauskaite stressed that in view of the signs of economic slowdown, the common goal of Europe and China should be "to unite efforts to stop the spread of protectionism in the world" and to "reduce competition" in the face of war.
"The commitment of China to create a more attractive, open environment for investment is very important for the European Union - this is important in negotiating a trade agreement with China.
It is important to conclude this trade agreement as soon as possible, ensuring that foreign business feels expected and safe here, as well as strengthening the protection of intellectual property," Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97> said.
She said China's opening up is important not only for Europe, but also for this country, as well as for global economic growth.
The Lithuanian leader stressed that the transparency of investments must be "above the interests of any business group".
"Transparency, rule of law, strict compliance with international agreements must be an essential issue for the environment of new investment relations," Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97> said.
"Corrupted capital flows should not be welcomed in any country in the world - not just here or in our countries," she added.
China's import show is trying to ease criticism that it is avoiding opening up its market and protecting only its companies.
The exhibition is attended by heads of several countries, more than 2,800 companies from 130 countries and regions around the world, including Lithuania.
According to the Lithuanian Statistics Department, China currently ranks 25th among export partners.
Last year Lithuanian exports to China increased by 50% - reaching 180 million euros.
At the same time, imports from China exceeded <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>820 million.
Some officials are concerned that China’s investment in Lithuania could bring undesirable political influence, and Beijing’s exceptional focus on Eastern Europe is breaking EU unity.

Cause of the Lion Air plane crash revealed: close relatives of the deceased
The black box data of the crashed Indonesian airline Lion Air indicates that at least four of its last flights have been disrupted by the speedometer, researchers said on Monday.
The chairman of the National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC) Soerjanto Tjahjono said a similar attack had occurred during the last four flights of the plane, including a decisive one when the wave landed in the Java Sea on October 29 just after taking off from Jakarta.
All 189 people on board the plane were killed in the crash.
A number of media reports have reported unrest during a previous Boeing 737 MAX 8 flight from Denpasar to the Indonesian capital.
“When we opened the black box, yes, the technical problem was the speed of the air, in other words, the speed of the plane,” Tjahyono said at a press conference.
"The data from the black box showed that the same problem was also present during the two flights before the Denpasar-Jakarta flight," he added.
“There are a lot of rumors on social media.
Now we want to clarify that in the black box (data left) about four flights, during which there were problems with the air velocity meter," the head of the NTSK said.
During a meeting with members of the deceased’s families, Tjahjon said the flight recorder’s information corresponded to reports that the plane’s last flight speed and altitude had changed irregularly.
The application teams have not yet found a second black box recording conversations in the pilot’s cabin.
Lion Air stated that after a technical failure occurred during the flight from Bali to Jakarta, it was repaired according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.
One of the company’s founders, Rusdi Kirana, was not invited to attend the meeting of communication minister Budi Karyos Sumadi, who moderated a meeting of family members with officials overseeing the search for the plane and the remains of the victims and the disaster investigation.
However, he stood up and bowed his head when angry and distressing family members demanded that Kirana, along with his brother Kusnan, present Lion Air in 1999.
"Lion Air did not behave properly," said a man dressed as the father of passenger Shandy Johan Ramadhan, who worked as a prosecutor on the island on which the plane flew.
"I want Mr. Rusdi Kirana and his team to pay attention," he said.
Since the start of the crisis, Lion Air has never contacted me.
We lost our child, but Lion Air showed us no remorse.”
After this meeting, Kirana hurried away, avoiding questions of journalists.
Many families are awaiting the long-term results of the deceased identification process.
Almost 140 lavender bags were handed over to police medical experts, loaded with people’s support parts.
So far, only 14 victims have been identified.
The family raised the question of why the aircraft was allowed to fly from Bali to Jakarta two months ago, even though a crash occurred during the flight on October 28, which caused passengers to be frightened by the plane's sudden crash immediately after the change.
Lion Air said the fault had been removed.
Is it true that the problem has been solved? asked one of the deceased's sons.
- If not, the relevant technicians must be held responsible.
The law was very clear, they did not say that the plane was allowed to rise again.
These bad technicians are obliged to respond according to the law so that the plane crashes in Indonesia do not happen again.
Tjahjono said that the large amount of small cracks and the fact that the cracks spread over a fairly small area indicate that the wavelength was likely to have flew into the water at a very high speed.
"The plane was lonely when it crashed into the sea.
He did not blow up the air, and the engines of the plane, when he touched the water, operated at high speeds - this shows all the turbine rims that had collapsed," the official said.
The crash of the Lion Air liner is the biggest aviation disaster in Indonesia since 1997, when 234 people were killed in the crash of the airliner Garuda near Medano.
After the crash, rescuers were led by the wreckage: injured and minor
On Monday evening, on the road to V<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>i<0xC4><0x87>i - Plung<0xC4><0x97>, Tilvi<0xC4><0x8D>i collided with cars "BMW" and "Mercedes-Benz".
The cars were hit by a concussion, three people were reportedly injured.
It is reported that the BMW driver, who was born in 1999, drove to the opposite side of the road and hit the Mercedes-Benz car, where his father was born in 1967, and his daughter, born in 2005.
The BMW driver was rescued from the crash by firefighters - rescuers.
A girl from Mercedes-Benz was killed in an accident.
All the victims were taken to the hospital.
Presidency: There is no need for artificial relief on referendum
When the Seimas approved the proposal to reduce the referendum charter for the first section of the Constitution, which currently has greater protection, the president will veto, said her adviser Mindaugas Ling<0xC4><0x97>.
"More than half of the population voted in favour of the Constitution - that is the requirement.
This and its amendment, in particular the articles contained in its first section, should certainly be at least a majority.
It’s not hard to predict that the president will really veto,” Dalia Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97>’s domestic policy adviser told news radio on Tuesday.
He stressed that the first section of the Constitution defines the basic matters of the state - language, flag, territory, capital, sovereignty of the state, so that the reduction in the number of votes necessary to replace these articles would not create a "negative precedent", according to M. Ling<0xC4><0x97>s.
"In the opinion of the president, there is no need for any artificial relief, more preparation for the referendum itself, more dialogue with the people," he said.
The Seimas are scheduled to vote on Tuesday for the adoption of an amendment to the Referendum Act.
It provides that a decision on the amendments to Sections 1 and 14 of the Higher Protection Constitution shall be adopted if at least two-fifths of the citizens with the right to vote agree in a referendum.
Currently, Articles 1 and 14 of the Constitution can be replaced by referendum by more than half of all citizens with the right to vote.
In Lithuania, about 2.5 million citizens have the right to vote: half of them are 1.25 million voters, two-fifths are a million voters.
This proposal was born after the Seimas vetoed the President's previous amendments adopted by Parliament in September, which softened the requirements for the number of votes in the amendment of Article 12 of the first section of the Constitution.
The referendum is proposed to reduce the referendum in preparation for the referendum on dual citizenship, which should take place on 12 May next year and on 26 May, when the first and second rounds of the presidential election are planned.
Immigrants cannot have dual citizenship on 11 March 1990 following the restoration of their independence, except for some exceptions.
The world’s Lithuanian community is striving for dual citizenship, but fears that the referendum will not take place under the current conditions – not enough people will be able to vote.
R. Masiulis: Lithuanian airports "bra<0xC5><0xA1>ka", so they need to be updated
Lithuanian airports and road infrastructure is starting to deteriorate, so it needs to be updated, says Transport Minister Rokas Masiulis.
According to him, the renewal of Vilnius Airport is a minimal task that the state must perform.
"The transport infrastructure of the war is already in ruins because it was planned for smaller passenger flows.
We need to renew Vilnius airport - this is not even part of the long-distance planning, that is the minimum we need to do," Masiulis said at the communication conference held by the Democracy Development Fund and the magazine "Valst<0xC4><0xB1>j<0xC4><0xB1>".
According to the minister, the next decade will be of great importance, because important projects will have to be implemented - the construction of the bridge "Via Baltica", "Rail Baltica", the construction of the external port of Klaip<0xC4><0x97>da, the renovation of the airports of Vilnius and Kaunas, and possibly the construction of a new airport.
"The next decade will be very important - we have to complete the integration of roads, railways, the construction of an external port in Klaipeda, arranging airports, perhaps deciding on the construction of a new airport.
We need to not sleep, we need to start projects now that will take advantage of our potential in 10, 20 or 30 years," he said.
Mr Masiulis reiterated that in recent years too little money has been allocated for road maintenance.
"The state of the road has not improved so far, because the funds are not allocated enough.
We expect to build new roads, but even the most necessary for maintenance, such as on highways, is lacking funds.
We need to set the amount to be allocated to road maintenance if we want their condition to improve," Masiulis said.
He stressed that Lithuanian transport services exports grew 18.6% this year, and the largest export market became Germany, encompassing Russia.
Mr Masiulis once again criticized the European Commission's proposal that carriers in EU countries will be obliged to periodically return tractors to the country of registration.
"We must strive to make our exporters in Western Europe feel at home.
In my opinion, the proposal for trucks to return home constantly is absurd, as empty trucks would be driven in Europe, burning fuel, increasing emissions.
Most of it is happiness railways, as the costs will increase so much that part of the transport will go to the railways.
We are looking for ways to defend our positions,” Masiulis said.
According to the Ministry of Communications, there are 12.2% in the transport sector.
Lithuania's Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
It employs more than 118,000 people and employs more than 7,500 companies.
Controversy with Heritage Guards
Last week, Mr Masiulis reported on the opening of negotiations on the cultural purpose of the Vilnius airport building - this would allow for the collapse of the old terminal and the construction of a new one.
However, the interim head of the Department of Cultural Heritage (KPD), Algimantas Degutis, called Massiuli’s discussions political pressure.
According to him, the building built in the sixties of the last century is a value, registered in 1993, and not a politician, and specialists have to decide on its elimination.
Mr Masiulis then commented that the modern arrival terminal would contribute to improving the image of Lithuania.
"To remove that old terminal from the legacy would be a politically important step to break it down and build a new modern arrival terminal, so that when you land in Vilnius you will feel in a modern country, not in such an interesting, truly unrepresentative, self-representing country," said Masiov.
Mr Masiulis then also said that Kaunas is planning to build a completely new passenger terminal and connect the airport to the Rail Baltica Canyon, building an underground station.
This transport hub is expected to operate in 2026, after the completion of Rail Baltica.
Last year, Vilnius Airport served about 3.7 million people, this year 4.8 million passengers are expected, and next year - 5 million.
Kaunas Airport served a total of 1.2 million passengers last year.

Next year from Vilnius will start direct flights to Madagascar
In the spring of next year, the largest regular passenger plane "Boeing 767" will land at Vilnius Airport, which will fly passengers from Lithuania directly to the island of Be, which belongs to Madagascar, based on the information of the travel organizer "Itaka Lietuva".
The Blue Panorama airline will be able to choose from 259 economy class and 8 business class seats.
The new direction of the holiday will be reached directly from Lithuania from April 2019.
Dominikas Milowskis, CEO of Itaka Lietuva, says that tourists from Lithuania are trying to offer new directions for their holidays.
Madagascar is an island in the Indian Ocean, near the East African coast.
New travel destinations for the summer 2019 season were also prepared by other travel organizers.
For example, Novatura and Itaka will start flying directly from Vilnius to Tirana (Albania).
Minister of Finance on a possible crisis: it is important not to cause the disease
“We always have to prepare for the toughest times.
What I would like to congratulate is that for the third year in a row, for the first time in Lithuanian history, we are accumulating reserves.
But it's also a very important thing not to get sick," Shapoka said during a visit to Brussels on Monday.
ELTA recalls that on Monday and Tuesday, Minister of Finance and Deputy Minister Mig<0xC5><0x82>a Tuskien<0xC4><0x97> will attend meetings of the Eurogroup and the EU Economic and Financial Council (ECOFIN) in Brussels.
The ECOFIN meeting discusses issues relating to the taxation of digital services.
This new tax aims to avoid fragmentation of the EU single market, as some Member States have already introduced or intend to introduce a certain tax at national level.
In the short term, it is proposed to agree on how to tax revenues for the provision of certain digital services in the EU until there is a global agreement.
The Eurogroup will review the draft budgets of the euro area countries submitted to the European Commission (EC).
On 23 October, the EC rejected the draft Italian budget as non-compliant with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact.
This is the first time the EC has taken advantage of this opportunity.
For more information please refer to Belgium, France, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain.
The Eurogroup will also discuss the issues of deepening the Economic and Monetary Union: the implementation of the European Deposit Insurance System and the reforms of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).
Lithuania supports a stronger role of the ESM in financial support programmes, but it is believed that the functions of the ESM must be clearly defined in order to avoid duplication of the functions of the ESM and other EU institutions.
Balys Bura<0xC4><0x8D>.
Traditions and customs of Lithuanian work
Recently, it has been 120 years since the birth of the famous Lithuanian photographer and cultural writer, ethnographer and landscape explorer Bali Bura<0xC4><0x8D> (1897-1972) in Sidari, <0xC5><0xA0>iaul<0xC4><0x97>n<0xC5><0xB3> vals<0xC4><0x97>, then <0xC5><0xA0>iauliai Governorate.
When we are talking about the 100th anniversary of the State of Lithuania, we have a great opportunity to remember how the life-ending national rebirth has called many Lithuanian people, including their brothers Buracz - Bali, Jona, Broni<0xC5><0xB3> - from the depths of the village, from the depths of the village to the depths of our creation.
Balys Burac<0xC4><0x83>, who has travelled through the countryside for more than 50 years with a camera in his hands, has provided a broad and realistic view of our country’s customs, traditions, folk art and material culture.
He sought to preserve the rapidly deteriorating clogs of national culture and had a rare ability to perceive the sustainable value of his work.
In the photographs of Bali Bura<0xC4><0x8D>, the landscape of Lithuania, the hills, the everyday and the festive environment, our people embellished with national costumes, decorated the pages of Lithuanian newspapers and magazines.
This publication presents a considerable part of the Balio Bura<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87>'s departure, which is dedicated to the description of national work habits and related traditions and, most importantly, their attractive iconography.
The published material shows not only the peculiarity and beauty of these traditions, but also the progress of our civilization over the past century, despite the two world wars and the heavy occupation.
In the manuscript of the book there is a very rich interpunk description of the works of the people of <0xC5><0xBD>emaitija, especially the Kup<0xC4><0x97>s, <0xC5><0xA0>aul<0xC4><0x97>s, Tel<0xC5><0xA1>i<0xC5><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87>, as well as the works of the people of <0xC5><0xBD>uki, their holidays and other traditions and customs written by Balio Bura<0xC4><0x8D>.
About 10,000 of the remaining negatives in the museums and archives were selected for this edition in over 400 rare, mostly unpublished, photos, which were grouped according to the selected texts.
They reflect the unique aspects of ethnic culture, characteristic of the Kup<0xC4><0xB1>k<0xC4><0xB1>m, Djuk<0xC4><0xB1>m, other districts of Haute-Aquitaine and Lower-Aquitaine.
In Panev<0xC4><0x97><0xC5><0xBE>i<0xC4><0x87>, a suspect found in a police car was released for 4 hours.
As a young man (born 1994) was able to escape from the office car, officials have not yet revealed.
He was taken into custody on suspicion of theft.
At about 4 p.m., police circulated a picture of the flight and asked the public for help: "The suspect, Dalius Malakauskas (born 1994), was the victim of the theft of a police car.
The man escaped with the seconds.

The tragic fate of the couple: dead after a few hours of marriage
A couple of newlyweds were killed in a helicopter crash in the southwestern part of the state of Texas just hours earlier.
24-year-old William Troy Byler and his wife, Bailee Raye Ackerman Byler, died on Sunday shortly after a helicopter crashed into a hill 16 km northwest of Juval and 129 km west of San Antonio, local peacekeeper Stevenne said.
It is strange that the accident occurred after about 24 kilometers, just as much as the newlyweds were a year old.
Helicopter pilot Gerald Douglas Lawrence, 76, also died.
The newlyweds studied at Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas.
They were married on Saturday evening at the hands of the Byler family near Juvaldi and after the wedding day, a family-owned helicopter was launched.
The accident occurred after a helicopter crashed about 24 kilometres.
The newlyweds flew to St. Anthony's International Airport, where they were going to board a plane and fly on a honeymoon, Kennedy said, not specifying the final destination for the couple.
"It's a very steep, uneven relief area, and that hill is about 120-150 meters high," Kennedy said.
Mr. D. Lawrence has been piloting the family's aircraft for many years.
According to Kennedy, he piloted helicopters and served in Vietnam.
After the autopsy, it should be clear what the pilot’s physical condition was and whether it could not have been the cause of the disaster.
The helicopter crashed about 5-10 minutes after the ascent.
The slope of his debris was wide on the slope of a rocky hill, and the body remained "dangerously strapped", Craig Hatch of the National Transport Safety Board (NTSB) said during a press conference on Monday.
The researchers are going to get rid of the cracks and then examine them thoroughly, but it will not be easy for the trailer and truck to reach that place, he said.
The cause of the disaster has not yet been identified, and the preliminary NTSB report should be published within two weeks.
Israeli Prime Minister Calls New Sanctions on Iran 'Historical Day'
"Today is a historic day," Netanyahu told members of his party's Likud parliament, his office said.
"Today is the day that, under the leadership of President Trump, the United States is imposing particularly severe sanctions on Iran, the toughest sanctions on Iran during all the time that the Israeli government began its efforts to suppress its aggression," the statement said.
Earlier on Monday, Israel’s defense minister Avigdor Lieberman said the new sanctions would give a “decisive” blow to Israel’s actions in the region.
The measures, which Washington calls "the toughest sanctions of all time", have come into effect after Trump's decision in May to withdraw from the world powers agreement with Tehran on his nuclear program.
The sanctions aim to significantly reduce Iran’s oil exports, which have already fallen by about a million barrels a day since May, and deter Tehran from international funding.
Israel has long been opposed to the agreement with Iran and says its scope and terms are too limited.
The Jewish state also says the lifting of sanctions has enabled Iran to finance militant groups and its own military activities.
Israel is particularly concerned about Iran’s actions in neighbouring Syria and has pledged not to allow it to be established militarily there.
Other parties to the agreements with Iran – Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia – disagree with the US decision and say that the agreement, as has been stipulated, has so far prevented Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.
The court again denounces the circumstances of the death of a young motorcyclist
With the death of a young motorcyclist in Vilnius, a city in the north, the court will hear the testimony of the witness.
The Vilnius District Court ruled on Tuesday that in order to clarify all the relevant circumstances of the case, a witness will be interviewed at the next hearing on November 26.
A verdict has already been pronounced in this case, but the prosecution disagrees with it.
On August 22, a district court in Vilnius city ruled that a 79-year-old Eduard Osipov, a motorcyclist, had been driving at high speed and had suffered a serious injury.
The Vilnius District Prosecutor’s Office asks the district court to annul the decision of the district court and argues that E. Osipov is the main culprit of the accident, while the conclusions of the district court are unfounded.
The family lawyer of the deceased motorcyclist also requests the annulment of the verdict.
The accident occurred on August 11, 2015, at about 3:00 p.m., when an E. Osipov-driven car “<0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia” from Lak<0xC5><0xAB>n<0xC5><0xB3> street entered <0xC5><0xBD>irm<0xC5><0xAB>n<0xC5><0xB3> street and collided with a motorcycle on the main road.
The prosecutor accused the man of violating road traffic rules and causing a traffic accident - a man who was riding a Piaggo motorcycle on the main road.
Initial police reports indicate that a motorcycle driver has died, but later after investigations, it has been found that the vehicle is comparable in power to a motorcycle.
Vilnius district court judge Roland Bu<0xC5><0xBE>inskas BNS said experts found that the motorcycle driver was driving at 89.2 kilometers per hour, although the speed allowed at the site was 50 kilometers per hour.
"The driver of the car could not have predicted that the motorcycle would drive at such a high speed," the judge said.
At the time, the driver of an honourable age car claimed to have driven only 5-6 kilometers per hour.
After seeing the obstacle, the motorcycle driver tried to stop and fell off the vehicle before colliding with the "Skoda Fabia".
The prosecutor believes that when Osipov was driving from side to main road, he was supposed to give way to the motorcyclist.
Novaya Gazeta: Six Vagner employees killed in Syria
Among the dead are five soldiers of the Syrian military and six persons belonging to the military company Vagner.
This is reported by the Novaya Gazeta source in Syria.
According to the source, a section of the 5th Syrian military corps was deployed in the said territory, to which several Syrian volunteers and “military personnel” joined.
Novaya Gazeta sent a request to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs with a request to provide information on the fate of the Russians.
The former King of Belgium will have to take a paternity test.
This decision is a partial victory by the artist Delphine Boel.
Since 2013, she has been seeking the recognition of the former monarch’s child.
The 50-year-old woman claims that her mother, Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps and Albert II had a short romance decades ago.
The 84-year-old king denies his fatherhood.
According to the station’s RTBF, he may, in opposition to DNA testing, appeal to the Supreme Court.
According to the Court of Appeal, Jacques Boelis, a former husband of the Delphian mother, is neither biologically nor legally the father of the artist.
Delphine asked for the appropriate investigation to be recognized as the daughter of Albert's "true" father.
The CCP will allocate money to the parties, but will not give anything to the social workers
The Supreme Electoral Commission (CVP) plans this week to allocate a budget subsidy of almost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 million to the largest political parties.
The Lithuanian Social Democrat Labour Party (LSDDP), headed by Parliament’s Vice-President Gedimina Kirkilo, was established in the spring of this year.
However, they can be designated as a separate decision by the VRK in the near future if the legal environment governing the allocation of grants to the parties changes.
Laura Matjo<0xC5><0xA1>ayte, the president of the VRK, told VN that "this Thursday a committee meeting is scheduled to take a decision on the allocation of half-yearly budget subsidy to parties".
According to her, the decision on this matter must be taken by the VRK by 15 November.
Seven parties, six of which are parliamentary, are expected to receive <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.751 million.
Opposition Union-Lithuanian Democrats should get more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>0.66 million for the Democratic Party of the Republic of Lithuania, but not for the Democratic Party of the Republic of Moldova - about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>0.55 million for the Democratic Party of the Republic of Moldova - about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>0.5 million for the Democratic Party of the Republic of Moldova - about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>0 million for the Democratic Party of the Republic of Moldova.
Under the current law, which is governed by the VRK, grants are allocated to parties that meet the requirements of the law and have received at least 3% of the votes in the recent session, municipal councils and European Parliament elections.
Therefore, the current legal regulation does not allow the LSDDP established this spring alone to expect to receive money from the budget.
The party has not participated in any elections yet.
It is true that the ruling coalition is trying to amend the law so that social workers receive at least a couple of hundred thousand euros in the next year's three elections - the municipality, the president and the European Parliament.
The corresponding amendments to the Political Parties and this year’s budget laws were vetoed by President Dalia Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97>.
The Seimas has not yet decided on this veto, but the ruling representatives Kirkiles and the Green-State leader Ram<0xC5><0xAB>n Karbauskis believe that parliamentarians will try to reject the opposition of the president.
However, this will not be expected until Thursday's VRK meeting, so, according to Mr Matjo<0xC5><0xA1>aityt<0xC4><0x97>, "subsidy will be allocated in accordance with the legal procedure that has so far existed".
True, the head of the VRK did not reject that if the Seimas rejects the presidential veto this or next week and new amendments to the budget allocation of funds to the parties, a decision on the allocation of an additional subsidy to the individual political forces of the PSD and the LSD could be considered in the commission.
"When we make the decision, we will take into account the entire legal environment in force, as we are the executive authority that has to implement the laws enacted," she said.
If the Seimas were able to reject a veto and the new laws entered into force, the government would allocate additional money to the parties, in addition to the corresponding amounts.
The grants already allocated to the seven parties would not be affected by such a decision.

Poroshenko: activists Handziuk assassination warrants must be punished
"I want to say that no version - and today more than 20 of them - will be rejected.
Each will be very carefully checked in accordance with the examination procedures.
As President, I have no opportunity and no obligation to obtain information that could damage the course of the investigation.
However, the government must ensure transparency and the law enforcement authorities must work efficiently.
This is the only way to find out the truth and punish the evil,” Poroshenko said at a meeting with the youth in Kiev on Tuesday.
He stressed that he is most of all interested in K. Handziuk’s murder to be explained, and that assassins, crime organizers and commanders would “acquire the necessary responsibility”.
“After this case has been requalified for murder, they are rightly and justly threatened with life imprisonment,” the president said.
He rightly called the public’s demand to investigate this case openly and impartially.
Mr Poroshenko stressed that the statements made by law enforcement officials in parliament should show that "the authorities are determined to arrest criminals and take responsibility for whatever they are".
He also said that political speculation on the subject would not help clarify the situation, but would be even more confusing.
"I call on all forces, both the government and the opposition, not to waste unfounded arguments and, God forbid, not to use this murder for public relations," he said.
- Conversely, now we need to unite and ensure that the research is effective, fair and transparent, fast - so as to build public confidence.
There’s just no other way for us.”
“No one will be allowed to take advantage of this situation to destabilize the situation in the country,” he said.
Handziuk, who fought before corruption, was attacked and engulfed with acid in the city of Cherson in July.
She was the mayor of this southern Ukrainian city.
The woman was hospitalized after the attack, but died in the hospital on Sunday.
After failing to explain the culprits of the attack to the police and prosecutors, Ukrainian Attorney General Yuri Lucenka filed a resignation statement on Tuesday.
After her death, officials were accused by public activists of not being able to properly conduct the investigation.
The activists also called for the resignation of the Attorney General and the Minister of the Interior.
"I am presenting my resignation today," Lucenka told MEPs, reading his report.
Parliament still has to approve the resignation of the prosecutor.
Lucenka accused activists of putting pressure on the investigation and missing important information, making it difficult to identify the perpetrators of the Handziuk murder.
Bill Gates introduces toilet without water
Introducing a futuristic toilet, Bill Gates’ transition from traditional such devices to a watershed-free equated with the computer revolution of the 1980s.
Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates presented a high-tech toilet in Beijing that does not need water drainage in the pipes, Reuters reported.
The toilet without water works according to the principle of separation of solid and liquid waste.
Both types of wastewater are processed into chemical fertilizers.
“The technologies you see here are the biggest achievements in sanitation in the last 200 years,” Bloomberg quoted Bill Gates as saying.
The tech toilet was created with the help of a charity fund founded by Bill Gates and his wife Melinda.
Within seven years, the fund spent <0x24>200 million on a plant that could turn human waste into fertilizer or water.
In total, according to Bill Gates, about 20 toilet models were created.
The device is now ready and can be sold.
However, in order for such toilets to be mass-produced, the Gates Foundation is ready to spend another 200 million.
According to the Gates Foundation, 500,000 children under the age of five die each year of poor sanitation in the world.
The fight against poor sanitation problems, such as cholera and others, is increasing health spending, which already amounts to 233 billion.
To better illustrate the sanitation situation that needs to be improved, Bill Gates to the toilet presentation glass with fecals.
According to him, it is a good reminder that in the small example "may be 200 trillion rotavirus cells, 200,000 bacteria causing infectious diseases, 100,000 worm parasitic eggs".

Concerns in France: Deaths cause concern
French health officials on Monday announced a permanent ban on a widely used pesticide, in response to concerns about dozens of people who have been poisoned in the country's western parts of the country.
The health agency ANSES announced that the decision to ban all pesticide meth products was taken following a new safety check that began earlier this year, before at least three poisoning waves began in the Arts and Louvre departments in September.
As a result, the government has already suspended the use of pesticides.
This soil disinfection chemical should not be in contact with plants or farm workers.
In order to be effective, the product must be used in large quantities.
In France, it was used for about 700 tons per year.
At least 70 people, including a large number of farm workers, complained of eye and throat constipation, respiratory problems in the Angie region, where a lot of salads are grown.
"These episodes confirm the correctness of our decision, but they did not make it clear," ANSES deputy director Francoise Weber (Francuaza Weber) told the newspaper on Monday.
Metam – one of the most commonly used pesticides in the U.S. and Europe – is considered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as “probable human carcinogen.”
This pesticide, marketed under the names Vapam and Sectagon, is allowed in Europe until 2022, when a new safety check is to be carried out.
"There was no other choice but to remove it from the market, regardless of whether there were any alternatives to it," Weber told the newspaper.
"We understand the difficulties that will arise for the growers of salad juices, the farmers in general, but the public health is more important," she said.
Farmers have already expressed dissatisfaction with the government's decision last month to stop the use of methane in a region whose economy is heavily dependent on intensive agriculture.
More than half of the 35,000 tons of salad juice consumed in Europe each year is grown in the region near Nantes.
Next season there will be "significantly fewer salads, salads and parsley", after the government stopped using methane last month, the head of the federation of growers in Nantes, Philippe Retiere, told AFP.
<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70 million invested in the shopping mall with an overview round
Next weekend, a new trading centre "T1" will be opened in the capital of Estonia, in which the local real estate development company "Pro Kapital Grupp" invested EUR 70 million.
The total area of 130,000 sq.m., or 55,000 sq.m. for rent, will operate at the commercial center of 150 shops, more than 30 cafes and restaurants, the developer said in a statement.
Comparatively, the total area of Vilnius "Acropolis" (calculated together with the area of offices) reaches about 110,000 sq.m. And is rented - 91,000 sq.m.
"T1" - the first mall with a review wheel installed on the roof, says the developer.
It will start working at the beginning of next year.
In addition to this, international transport gates will also be integrated into the territory: next to the tram stops, intercity buses will soon run.
The main Rail Baltica terminal is also in the vicinity, and it is projected to serve 1 million passengers per year by 2026.
Paola Michelozzi, CEO of the Pro Capital Group, says that the global trading center business is undergoing significant changes and that the T1 has managed to be ahead of them.
“We’ve created a new generation of shopping centers that deliver emotions and experiences that are not accessible online.
It is a place of people's attraction in the very center of the city, a gateway for travelers, an impressive and worthwhile attraction and at the same time a quality time spent with friends or family," Michelozzi said in a statement.
A lot of attention to entertainment
According to the head of the shopping center, the T1 also has the largest entertainment and discovery center in the Baltic States.
A total of 12,000 sq.m. is used for entertainment, or a fifth of the total rental area.
Exclusive accent - a review wheel installed on the roof.
It will lift guests to 120 m above sea level - Tallinn Higher only TV Tower.
After the review round, on the fourth floor, the Super Skypark will operate, opening the largest marina center in Europe and the first basketball and netting square on the marina in Estonia, the company says.
At the interactive SkyLAB research and discovery center, children are promised to take at least 5-6 hours.
The entertainment complex also features 360-degree panoramic 4D cinema.
In addition to the usual cinema, which is displayed in six halls, visitors will also be able to experience virtual reality cinema with interactive 7D cinema.
In addition to the visual effects and the rhythm of the film, the feeling of realism will be reinforced by the combined effects of wind, rain or snow, as well as the selected smells, smoke or smoke in the cinema.
According to the developer, the opening of T1 is expected to increase Estonia’s revenue from tourism by <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>13 million per year, attracting over 300,000 visitors.
The Pro Capital Group is listed on the Nasdaq Baltic Stock Exchange, as well as on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.
The group received EUR 1.8 million in sales revenue in Lithuania last year and suffered EUR 350,000 losses, according to the financial report of Pro Capital Group.
In 2016, the Lithuanian market received almost EUR 9 million in sales revenue and a net profit of EUR 2.4 million.
The shopping center "T1" was built by the Estonian company "Mark Ehitus".
President Paul Biya accedes to seventh term in Cameroon after controversy
During the 85th anniversary of parliamentary chairman Cavaye Yeguie Djibril's observance, Biya pledged to preserve the "unity and unity" of the West African state.
Africa’s oldest president, who has ruled its country for 35 years, was declared the winner in the October 7 election, with 71 percent of the vote.
However, the elections were blurred by low voter activity, violence and suspected fraud.
On the eve of Biyo’s inauguration, 79 students and three school staff, including the director, were kidnapped at a Presbyterian school in the Northwest region where English-speaking separatists campaigned for independence.
The majority of Cameroon’s 22 million people are French-speaking, and one-fifth are English-speaking.
In 2016, in the North-West and neighbouring South-West provinces, when dissatisfaction with alleged discrimination in education, judiciary and economics began to demand autonomy.
In 2017, when Biya refused to resign, he declared an independent state, the "Ambassador Republic", and raised his arms.
According to NGOs, at least 400 civilians and more than 175 security forces were killed in separatist attacks and government response operations this year.
More than 300,000 people have fled the violence: some through the border to Nigeria, but many have been forced to live in semi-fierce forests.
In October, only 5% of voters voted in the North-West region and 15% in the South-West province.
In both parts of the country, Biya collected two-thirds of the vote.
Conservative primary elections: errors caused by inexperience
"When there is a lack of space, understand that the party organized everything with its own resources.
Some municipalities allowed the use of their premises, but there were no voting booths everywhere, because we cannot buy them ourselves.
“Thank you to those who borrowed it,” the politician said.
According to him, complaints have been received, but their content does not change substantially, and the infringements themselves are not of a malicious nature.
“There were complaints.
Not all of the people who participated in the elections were aware of this – it was news for them as well.
So from that inexperience not all actions corresponded to our order.
Therefore, it was necessary to warn the CRK to comply with the principles we have described.
These complaints are nonetheless grounds for doubting the results,” Anushauskas said.
According to the President of the CRK, there were cases in which the ballot papers were not printed - after learning of this, the ballot papers found in the ballot papers without the stamp were cancelled.
Some cities lacked space, but according to Anushausko, complaints and violations are related to dozens of bulletins.
"Well, since the difference is a few thousand, it really doesn't make a significant difference to the election results," Anushauskas explained.
It is said that the activity of the party members in the elections was 55%, while the activity of non-partisan voters was 69%.
Both candidates had 400 observers and 600 people worked on commissions.
The results announced on Sunday also remained unchanged, with 79 per cent of voters voting for the winner Ingrid <0xC5><0xA0>imonyt<0xC4><0x97> (16418 votes), while 21 per cent (4441 votes) for Vygaud U<0xC5><0xA1>acka.
On November 17, the TS-LKD Council will officially support I. <0xC5><0xA0>imonyt<0xC4><0x97>'s candidacy in the country's presidential elections in May next year.
Trump says he probably won’t meet with Putin in Paris
White House National Security Adviser John Bolton has previously said Trump will meet with Putin in Paris, where events will be held this week to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I.
But on the way to the last rally before the mid-term elections in the US Congress, Trump told reporters not to be sure if this would be a good opportunity to meet with the Russian president.
"I'm not sure we'll meet in Paris.
Probably not,” the US president said.
However, the White House leader added, seeing the same during the G20 summit and "probably meeting many times" thereafter.
Trump continues to try to "overload" relations with Moscow, despite suspicions that Russia interfered in the 2016 US presidential election.
K<0xC4><0x99>stutis Strupas requests the annulment of the VTEK decision
K<0xC4><0x99>stutis Strupas, former director general of Santaro Clinics at the University of Vilnius, has asked for the annulment of the decision of the Higher Service Ethics Commission (UAE) - it has been recognized that no transactions have been declared in time and thus violated the law.
K. Strupo's complaint was examined by the administrative court of Vilnius County on Tuesday.
The decision will be announced on November 26.
The applicant requests the annulment of the decision of the VTEK on May 23, BNS reported to the court representative Sigita Jacinevi<0xC4><0x8D>ien<0xC4><0x97> Baltaduon<0xC4><0x97>.

In May, VTEK announced that Silvija Stropupen<0xC4><0x97>, the head of the Ambulatory Rehabilitation Department of the University Hospital of the Republic of Vilnius, and the then retired Director General of Santaro Clinics, K. Strupas, violated the provisions of the law on the declaration of private interests.

Strupien<0xC4><0x97> also declared these transactions by default.
Persons who have violated the law on the harmonisation of public and private interests in the public service may not be encouraged for a year.
The law obliges you to declare not only your own, but also your spouse’s data.
The study was conducted by VTEK on the basis of Info TV television information.
Explaining whether K. Strupas and his wife, the head of the Department of Ambulatory Rehabilitation of the University Hospital of the Republic of Vilnius, S. Strupien<0xC4><0x97> correctly and in a timely manner declared their transactions.
Last year, according to Info TV, Strup gave his daughter a property worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>125,000.
However, the former head of the Santa Rosa clinics and his wife had not indicated their interests in the declarations.
Law enforcement Mr Strupu, along with at least a dozen others, has expressed suspicions of corruption in the investigation - according to law enforcement, for the winning purchases of public computers, software in clinics demanded from companies of illegal financial compensation, he was masked as
In this way, Mr. Strupa is suspected of having been married at least five times during public procurement in the field of information technology in the clinics of Santa Rosa.

You already want to teach differently in schools: promises fewer tests, more practice
These changes are planned by the Ministry of Education and Science, which presented them at the Forum "Change in Educational Content: Foreign Experience for Solutions in Lithuania" held in Vilnius on Monday.
Speaking at the debate, Minister of Education and Science Jurgita Petrawskien<0xC4><0x97> said that over 30 million euros have been invested in the renewal of educational content over the past ten years, but no results have been seen.
"According to the results of the international student achievements survey PISA, student achievements are below the OECD average," said Minister of Education and Science Jurgita Petrauskien<0xC4><0x97>.
The OECD expert Phil Lambert (Filas Lambert) cited the report by the Ministry of Education and Science, saying that Lithuania is too focused on the provision of knowledge, not on the practical application of knowledge.
According to him, Lithuania’s general education programs focus heavily on educating students’ writing, critical thinking, respect and responsibility, but it also needs to educate children’s creativity, entrepreneurship, financial writing, empathy.
Deputy Minister of Education and Science, Gra<0xC5><0xBE>vid Kazakevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius, in presenting the changes in the contents of general education, said that the scope of the programmes to be renewed in this academic year will be reduced, they will be more specific, the disciplines will be more closely interconnected.
According to the deputy minister, pupils' education will be more individualized, schools will become more independent - they will be allowed to prepare from 10 to 30% of their unique educational content, the current pupils' rating system will change to a cumulative score, a higher weight will be gained and informal by means of training.
Reduced standardized tests.
It is promised that the general education programmes will be a digital, user-friendly, e-resource-related task bank.
The renewal of educational content aims to improve the achievements of students in the international PISA study by at least 10 per cent, and to reduce by one-third the gap between the achievements of pupils acquired by the school’s modern competences in a variety of areas.
Lithuania plans to allocate <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.8 million from the European Union and the state budget to renew the educational content from May 2018.
It is expected that the project of renewed general education programmes for the academic year 2019-2020 will be tested in the part of schools and will be implemented in all schools from September 2021.
At the beginning of October, the ministry received criticism for a project of almost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8 million undertaken by the Centre for Education Development to renew the basic, basic and secondary education curricula.
The first <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.3 million purchase was announced in early October, with a four-year budget of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.8 million to seek out educational programme developers.
After criticizing the purchase, he was suspended and the Minister of Education and Science, J.Petrauskien<0xC4><0x97>, dismissed the director of the Education Development Centre, Giedri<0xC5><0xB3> Vaidel<0xC4><0x97>.

Exercises will also demonstrate the combined capacity of Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian firefighters to pump a large amount of water from the embedded areas.
For this purpose, the module "BaltFloodCombat" was established in 2009.
Resignation of Ukrainian Attorney General Yuri Lucenka
Ukrainian prosecutor-general Yuri Lucenka on Tuesday announced his resignation in the country's parliament over the resonance caused by the deaths of acid-coated anti-corruption fighter Katerina Gandziuk, according to the Ukrainian news agency Unian.net.
Under the laws of Ukraine, the request for resignation must be submitted by the Attorney General to the President of the country, and this - to provide the Supreme Council with a majority of the votes approved.
On Tuesday, Attorney General Lucenko presented a law enforcement investigation into the progress and results of the assassination order in the Supreme Court.
In his speech to parliamentarians, he described the study as effective, but expressed his indignation that Mr Gandziuk's death was being exploited by politicians for public relations.
Gandziuk was a Ukrainian activist, a fighter against corruption, publicly speaking about police corruption in her hometown of Cherson, southern Ukraine.
On July 31, an unidentified attacker, K. Gandziuk, squeezed acid into her face.
On November 4, she died of injuries in the hospital.
Protesters at the Ministry of the Interior of Ukraine demand an answer, who killed K. Gandziuk, AFP/Scanpix nuotr.
According to Lucenko, the law enforcement investigation includes 12 people who may have been involved in the assassination order of K. Gandziuk.
However, one of the most likely versions of the study has been leaked to the media, which poses a threat to the success of the study.
According to the Attorney General, the suspects received essential information about the leaked information.
Lucenko added that he had met Mr Gandziuk personally and was outraged that some politicians were using her blood for public relations.
"If no one has any reason to say that someone is in control of the government, I want to say that I am making a resignation statement.
I will present it to the President of Ukraine today and you will have to discuss this issue in Parliament," the newspaper Obozrevatel quoted Lucenko as saying in the Radeya.
Lucenko added that "there is no way to allow bi-government in the country when the law enforcement system is broken without any evidence, even for revealed crimes".
Lucenko is considered a close companion of President Petro Poroshenko.
He was appointed prosecutor-general on May 12, 2016, following prolonged attempts to remove his predecessor, Viktor Shokin, suspected of corruption by top-level officials and politicians.
Minister of Energy J. Vai<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC5><0xAB>nas meets with representatives of "Orlen Lithuania"
As Elta informed Energy Minister Adviser Aurelija Vernickait<0xC4><0x97>, the meeting will discuss the achievement of renewable energy targets in the transport sector by 2020 and after 2020.
According to the European Commission (EC), transport is the only sector that currently does not reach the trajectory for renewable energy at EU level in the consolidated national renewable energy action plans – in 2015, it accounted for 6% of renewable energy.
According to the EC, progress towards the mandatory 10 % target in the transport sector is quite slow due to various difficulties, including quite high costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and unclear regulation.
Renewable energy in this sector mainly comes from biofuels (88%), and electricity plays a lesser role at this stage.
Seimas took the proposal to supplement the corruption investigation with the request of the Conservatives to the KT
Seimas on Tuesday agreed to a proposal recorded for the investigation on the illegal influence of the "state" Agne <0xC5><0xA0>irinskien<0xC4><0x97>, head of political processes.
There were 58 Members of the Parliament, with 27 abstentions.
The draft will be discussed further by the Seimas Committees appointed by A. <0xC5><0xA0>irinskiene, headed by the Committee on Law and Order.
Upon receipt of its conclusion, an amendment to the decision will be voted on.
Currently, the Seimas Interim Investigation Commission, which is conducting a new investigation into political corruption, has been asked to interpret the possible illegal influence in 2008-2016.
Mr <0xC5><0xA0>irinskien<0xC4><0x97> proposed extending this term by stating that "there was significant information in the public space about the possible illegal influence and impact on political processes and public institutions".
A. <0xC5><0xA0>irinskien<0xC4><0x97> in the draft lists "possible representation of the interests of pension funds in the legislative process or by appealing to the Constitutional Court or attempts to influence the decision-making processes of important independent institutions such as the High Commission on Ethics of the Office".
The appeal to the Constitutional Court on pensions was initiated by opposition conservatives.
The governing "States" found out that the Conservatives largely relied on the arguments of private pension funds lawyers in their applications.
Influenced by the High Commission on Service Ethics (State Ethics) leaders accuse former comrade Povil<0xC4><0x97> Urb<0xC5><0xA1>i.
According to them, the former chairman of the Seimas State Governance and Municipality Committee could have appointed VTEK members to dismiss the former head of the Prevention Division, Mindaugas Siauri.
At the end of September, the Seimas convened a commission to explain the potentially unlawful influence of interested parties or their groups, the impact on the course of elections, the formation of coalitions, the work of parliamentary factions, individual politicians, the governance of governments, parties and public movements, the governance and the legality of the governance, the governance and the law.
It is also proposed to ask what information the law enforcement and intelligence authorities have provided to the competent authorities as to how they have reacted to it.
Researchers should submit their findings by 1 May next year.
There will be a presidential election campaign in the European Parliament.
Of the 12 members of the Commission, seven are representatives of the "States".
Its members are also appointed by two social workers, one of them a "mandatory", a liberal and a representative of the Lithuanian Union of Christian Families in the Polish elections.
Conservatives and social democrats refused to participate in the commission.
The new investigation was initiated by President Ram<0xC5><0xAB>nas Karbauskis of the ruling Lithuanian states and Greens Union.
According to him, a study by the National Security and Defence Committee (NSGK) last session has essentially shown that the investigation needs to be continued on the same issues.
German Interior Intelligence Officer Lost Job
The 55-year-old Maassen has sparked controversy by saying that he is blamed for his "radical left-wing force" in Merkel's coalition.
As a result, he was not relocated to the next post, as promised, but was forced to leave the stock.
Last weekend, it was revealed that at a meeting of representatives of European internal intelligence organizations held in Warsaw a few weeks ago, Mr Maassen criticized Merkel's "naïve" immigration policy.
German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, who has defended the head of intelligence for a long time, said at a press conference on Monday that Maassen's recent comments were unacceptable and "personally disappointed".
Seehofer himself, having been pressured by both the dispute and the poor appearance of his party in the Bavarian local government elections, asked President Frank-Walter Steinmeier to put Maassen in reserve.

Body Girls Breaking Stereotypes About Wedding Dresses
Body girl with white inflated wedding dress - mission (not) possible?
Is it possible for a white floating bed to be larger than the size of S or M and still look attractive?
In addition to the size of the reality show "The evolution of Daddy (r)" participants will already prove today that the beauty and elegance of the wedding really does not depend on the kilograms of a woman.
But that's not all - one of the girls of the project will fall in tears of happiness tonight - her boyfriend will appear on the filming square.
“There are those who think that older girls don’t get the boys’ attention or look.
It's just a myth - my guy himself is an athlete, but he likes me what I am, he doesn't require me to have any standards-compliant figures," - before the performance with the wedding dress, Aurika will speak on the show.
The wedding dress is not light, in every sense, the dress - it is a complex construction, it contains a lot of materials, the dress is heavy, uncomfortable for movement.
Also, some women think that a bigger girl in a white dress will look even bigger and therefore less confident in themselves.
I can rest assured that the rightly chosen dress model will definitely solve this "problem", - one of the show's members, the fashion designer Robert Kalinkin explained.
R. Kalinkin decides the fate of the girls in the project together with the entire commission - Erika Vitulskiene, photographer and social network star Nagliu Bierancu and TV producer Laura Paukste.
"When deciding which girl has to say goodbye to the show, there are a lot of questions among the members of the commission - because we all represent different spheres and imagine the winner of the show differently.
The task of demonstrating wedding dresses has become even more difficult, and this - I can now reveal - that there were two newbies who were certainly not worse than the naked.
It was a special evening in every sense,” says R. Kalinkin.
Newbies - 23 years of scandalous behavior in one summer reality show, when Eve and the mother of two children of exceptional beauty in 31 years, Dovi<0xC4><0x97> - as well as other girls participated in the "Dy<0xC5><0xBE>i<0xC5><0xBE>i (r) evolution" selection and entered the top 20.
Unfortunately, after the first very open photo session of girls in the streets of the city of Vilnius, they had to say goodbye to the project.
The girl returned to the show to LNK viewers for their favorite vote on the TV portal.
The second week of the Internationally Recognized Beauty Show in Lithuania is already taking place - here, plus the size of the girls competed for the name of the first country plus the size of the star.
So far, there are only eight of them - and they all understand perfectly that the winner can only be one.
Intriguing and unpredictable reality show "Daddy's (r) evolution" week begins as early as Monday evening at 20:30 in the LNK.
Actor I. Elba elected as World's Sexiest Man
U.S. magazine People has named it the most sexy man in the world this year.
He became the 46-year-old British actor Idris Elba.
While the man claims that this message was unexpected when talking about the new title, he did not tolerate brilliance.
I thought, "It can't be!
Seriously?".
Then I looked myself in the mirror and thought, yes, today I look sexy, laughing at the actor.
Honestly, Idris said that this title is a very pleasant feeling that underpinned his ego.
The British star often believes in inviting deceptive words and tricks, which made his childhood difficult, because, as he himself calls it, he was "very tall and incomprehensible".
The young actor did not believe and became an object of controversy to his peers, both because of his rare and unusual name and his African origin.
"I've just pulled my tails and my muscles into the toughest guy in my town district," Idris smiled.
When a man loses to be the greatest on the screens of Ose, I. Elba works as a speaker at parties held in Spain, and especially in the tumultuous Ibiza.
In his spare time, a man enjoys Thai boxing and has a passionate meditation that he realizes by creating his own line of clothes.
The British actor believes that the most important thing for him in the world is his family, so he plans to marry his fiancée Sabrina Dhowre.
Elba became the 33rd Sexiest Man in the World to be elected by People magazine.
In 2017, the title was awarded to Blake Shelton.
Man Killed During Drunk Drinks in Shruti District
On Monday evening in the <0xC5><0xA0>irvint<0xC4><0x97> district of <0xC5><0xA0>alki<0xC5><0xA1>ki<0xC5><0xA1>i<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x8D> village, a man was killed during a drunken night.
According to Vilnius County Police, at 21.16 a.m., a man was reported to have beaten a neighbor during the drinks.
When doctors arrived, they found the death of a man who was born in 1943.
He was arrested in 1994 by a suspect who was convicted of drunkenness of 2.53.
Police are explaining the circumstances of the incident.
Managers do not require a 20 km distance when building waste incineration plants
Vilnius cogeneration power plant is being built, near Gari<0xC5><0xAB>n Market.
The authorities are no longer seeking to maintain a 20-kilometer distance from the settlements during the construction of the waste incineration plants.
The head of the Environmental Protection Committee "State" K<0xC4><0x99>stutis Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eika registered an amendment to the Waste Management Act in the Seimas on Monday, which denies such a requirement.
According to Mr Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eki, the "States" group, which had previously supported the 20 km provision, promises to support the amendment due to its refusal.
Mr. Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eikos’ amendment provides that from January 2019, waste incineration plants could be built with environmental and public health requirements set by law.
He acknowledges that the amendments have raised the President's doubts as to the prohibition.
"Given the definition of residential area, it is clear that it would be almost impossible to find such places where the above-mentioned objects could be constructed," said the chairman of the committee.
In October, the ruling majority opposed the president’s veto amendments, which tightened the construction of waste incineration plants.
In addition to prohibiting the construction of waste incineration plants within 20 kilometres of settlements, the amendments provided the government with permission to make decisions on the future of the two already built power plants, taking into account public health interests.
The latter provisions are not proposed by Mr Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eika.
In Vilnius, a waste and biofuels power plant is being built by the energy group "Lietuvos energia" and Kaune - together with the Finnish energy group "Fortum" company "Fortum Heat Lietuva".
The latter is already burning waste in Klaipeda.
Talk about possible compromise in Brexit negotiations
Britain’s and Ireland’s leaders discussed a possible compromise on Monday in addressing the complex issue of Northern Ireland, which calls for Brexit negotiations, Dublin said.
British Prime Minister Theresa May has offered a chance to revise the so-called mechanism of the Securities Agreement, which would leave an open border between the United Kingdom’s Northern Ireland province and the Republic of Ireland belonging to the European Union.
Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has promised to consider this proposal, but has rejected any possibility for Britain to unilaterally withdraw from the deal, the Irish government said in a statement.
In the interview, Th. May "raised the opportunity to review the mechanism of the measures to be taken in custody", it states.
"The speaker made it clear that he is open to reviewing new proposals, provided that the result of such a review does not involve a unilateral decision to terminate the enforcement measures," the government said in a statement.
Brexit negotiators do not find an acceptable solution to avoid checks at the UK-Ireland land border when Britain withdraws from the single market and customs union next March.
The two sides agree on "protective measures" to keep the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland open until a larger trade agreement is signed to ensure that additional customs checks at the border are not carried out.
The EU wants Northern Ireland to continue to adhere to EU customs rules, but London wants them to be applied temporarily to the whole of the UK.
The Daily Telegraph reported on Monday that Brexit secretary Dominic Raab aims to make Britain withdraw from the deal unilaterally after three months.
However, Varadkar told reporters in Dublin that his government "cannot support this."
"Three-month or limited-term safeguards are not worth the paper on which they will be written," he said.
Earlier, London and Brussels had not confirmed information on the breakthrough in Brexit negotiations following a weekend announcement in Britain that the deal was hand in hand.
"I'd say we're continuing to make progress in the negotiations, but there's still work to be done," May said in a statement.
European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schin also told reporters: "We're not there yet."
Nobel Prize laureates call for access to reliable information
A group of prominent thinkers, including Nobel Prize laureates, on Monday issued a statement calling for the right to reliable information in the Internet era.
Among the 25 people who have signed the International Declaration on Information and Democracy are economists Varrtya Sena (Amartja Sena) and Joseph Stiglitz (Joseph Stiglitz), the Nobel Peace Prize winner of the Iranian Lawyer Literary Prize (Maribellius Laitius), and the human rights activist Nobilius Laoga<0xC5><0x9F>as Ebadi (Shirin Ebadi).
"We call on goodwill leaders across all continents to take action to strengthen democratic models and open public debates through which citizens can make decisions based on facts," the group said in a statement.
They argue that the "world information and communication space" is a common good that "must be safeguarded in order to strengthen freedom of expression and opinion".
"People have a fundamental right to information that is freely collected, processed and distributed on the basis of the truth of commitment, the principles of pluralism and rational methods of fact-finding," the statement said.
The document seeks help from world leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump, who often criticized “false news” but regularly accused of distortion of facts.
World leaders should express their position on this issue when they meet at the “Peace Forum” in Paris on November 11-13, the signatories said.
This declaration was prepared within two months, under the direction of Sh. Ebadi and Christophe Deloire, head of the Paris-based organization for media freedom and protection of journalists, Reporters Without Borders (RSF).
Among the signatories are former Senegalese President Abdou Dioufa (Abdu Dufa), Chinese lawyer and human rights activist Teng Biao and political scientist Francis Fukuyama (Francis Fukuyama).
Seimas Approved Higher Penalties for Harmful Products
Seimas has agreed to amendments to the Product Safety Act, which require an increase in fines for product safety violations.
Amendments were approved unanimously in the sitting.
As said by Antana Vinkus, Member of the Seimas Committee on Health, when talking about the new project, he welcomes the fact that the objectives set are related to better consumer protection of products.
Its provisions shall also be aligned with the requirements of a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
"My head, in the proposed bill, is better and more specifically distributed to all operators involved in the supply and distribution process: manufacturers, service providers, importers, distributors and others.
As practice shows, the penal system in force now does not always prevent further infringements, because the entities that have paid the fine continue to commit repeated infringements," - said Vinkus.
The project was prepared by the Ministry of agriculture and, after the approval of the Government, the Seimas Economic Committee supplemented it with its proposals.
The amendments aim to increase the penalties for infringements, strengthen the protection of consumers' rights, give market surveillance authorities more power and establish a clear monitoring system for product safety requirements and compliance.
According to the Ministry of agriculture, there is currently no obligation for producers to properly label the product and thus ensure its traceability.
Furthermore, according to the Ministry, the market surveillance authorities did not have the right to access the territory of producers and suppliers, buildings, premises, inspections, and this makes it difficult for the authorities to do so.
According to the Ministry’s assessment, the six-month deadline for the award of fines and warnings is too short to identify the infringement, conduct an investigation and impose a penalty.
Also, according to the ministry, the penalties imposed are not effective enough.
Companies often repeatedly violate the requirements of the law - only 14 companies did so in 2017.
The Ministry of Agriculture has proposed to impose an obligation on producers to properly label the product, thus ensuring its traceability, so as to facilitate clarification by market surveillance authorities for suppliers of non-compliant products.
It is also proposed to give market surveillance authorities the right, through state product safety controls, to access the operators who produce, supply, market, territory, buildings, premises, and carry out inspections.
It is intended to increase the amount of penalties for violations of the law.
A fine of between EUR 150 and EUR 2 500 (now EUR 144 to 1448) would be imposed on the manufacturer, importer or authorised representative who has placed dangerous goods on the market and on the distributor who has placed them on the market or provided dangerous services to the service provider.
A fine of EUR 1,000 to 5,000 (now EUR 868 to 4 344) would be imposed if the State Consumer Protection Authority (VVTAT) or another market surveillance authority decided to prohibit the supply and supply of dangerous products or dangerous services.
Without the requirement to remove hazardous products from the market, recover them from consumers and destroy them, a fine of between EUR 2500 and EUR 6,500 (now EUR 1,448 to EUR 5,792) would be imposed.
If dangerous products had harmed the health of the consumer, a fine would be imposed between EUR 2 500 and EUR 15,000 (now EUR 1 448 to EUR 11584).
If dangerous products caused the death of a consumer, a fine of between 6 500 and 25,000 euros (now from 5 792 to 23 169) would be imposed.
According to the Ministry, in Poland and Austria, the infringement of the legislation on product safety is subject to a fine of up to 25,000 euros (minimum penalty not specified), in Belgium - from 26 euros to 600,000 euros, in Romania - from 155 euros to 666 euros, from 655 euros to 666 euros.
10-Year-Old Child Has Been Raped by Family Member
The incident in Colombia has haunted millions of people.
A 10-year-old girl, raped by her older brother, gave birth to a healthy boy.
The baby saw the world thanks to a cesarean section, but both the girl and her baby feel fine.
They were taken care of by doctors for a while.
It has to be a little while before the young mother and the child are left home.
"Based on the information I received from police officers, the minor became pregnant after she was sexually abused by a family member - her brother," the director of the hospital told a foreign television station.
Police are investigating the incident of rape and violence against children.
Norway's armed battalion participated in NATO exercises in the most remote and arid areas
Soldiers from the Norwegian Armed Forces participated in a series of complex exercises in the mountains north of the country's capital Oslo.
This is part of NATO’s “Trying to Connect 2018” exercise, the biggest NATO exercise since the end of the Cold War.
Most of the soldiers from the second Norwegian military battalion spent a lot of time away from home in places like Afghanistan, that is, in warm countries, after the September 11 terrorist attacks.
But most of all they are skilled in fighting in the Arctic, and these skills are especially useful now that NATO is changing its focus.
In recent days, in the mountains to the east of Tinsett, often in the most remote and harsh areas, soldiers have participated in staged battles against real British soldiers.
Soldiers have the skills to survive in this cold in the wild, but in a harsh climate they have to put much more weight on their shoulders - one luggage weighs about 50 kg.
Soldiers in command say that they share their skills to survive and fight under such conditions with other NATO troops.
According to the soldiers, these exercises, which, like no other, are reminiscent of real warfare, will teach them to be prepared if there is a serious threat.
Premier League champions have won the first season's win

Kaunas's deputy vice president does not plan to return to politics
Former vice-president of Kaunas, Povilas Maciuli, who has left work in the municipality and the Vieng Kaunas organization for the presidential election, does not plan to return to politics and promises to focus on business.
“I want to focus on business.
I am a shareholder in a number of companies, and I also have ideas for new projects.
And most importantly, I will be able to enjoy the opportunity to devote more time to the family,” Maciulis said.
He also said he was not planning to participate in the upcoming municipal elections.
Maciulis had not had the opportunity to talk to Ushacka after this Sunday lost the primary elections of the National Union of Christian Democrats-Lithuanian Union to Ingrida <0xC5><0xA0>imonyta.
“If we’re honest, we haven’t talked to him and the team yet to discuss the results in detail and tell us about the plans for the future.
Obviously, after Vygaud has withdrawn from the further election struggle, this stage of my life is over,” Maciulis said.
He said he did not regret the decision to leave Kaunas’s policy of supporting U<0xC5><0xA1>ack, but regretted that “Lithuania has lost a unique opportunity to have a true leader in the context of international relations”.
Maciulis worked briefly as Deputy Mayor of Kaunas in 2011, and later returned to these positions after the successful "Vienningam Kaunas" elections in 2015.
He is a shareholder of the private school "Herodito Liceus" and several other companies.
Workers in the woods: what are they doing here?
The Kaunians, seeing the workers in the castle of Kaunas, will realize that the restoration of the remaining tower is finally underway.
Gabrielius Su<0xC5><0xBE>ied<0xC4><0x97>lis, director of the Museum of the City of Kaunas, told the portal that work is being done to change the roofing of the southwestern tower with a fragment of the defensive wall.
According to the owner, the roofs will be scrambled.
“The worn-out debris posed a threat to the environment – people could get in and hurt – and it was necessary to replace it.
The roofs were no longer resistant to moisture, so it was also damaging to the heritage," explained the director of the museum.
Will these roofs be similar to those that were a few centuries ago?
"All work is done in conjunction with the heritage and other institutions", - G. Szeazid<0xC4><0x97>lis added, striving to make the result as authentic as possible, but at the same time the important and practical side - roof values must be protected from moisture.
Working with the legacy is a universal solution chosen.
Before this, the elements of the Kaunas Castle were covered in the Soviet year, so they no longer had historical value," - the director of the Kaunas City Museum detailed.
The contract was signed on 2 October.
It is planned that the work will not take longer than three months from the signing of the contract.
"It is expected to be completed by the end of November," the director of the museum said.
According to him, the value of the work carried out is almost 24,000 euros.
This amount, he said, was foreseen in this year’s budget.
Work is carried out in Kaunas Castle by the company "Statija".
Kaunas. diena.lt is written, according to the research carried out, Kaunas castle could have looked earlier.
U.S. and South Korea Renew Military Navy Exercises
Two weeks into the southern city of Pohang will be conducted a navy exercise with about 500 soldiers, the Ministry of Defence said.
There are 28,500 troops deployed in South Korea.
The two sides have been preparing joint military maneuvers for years, which Pyongyang calls "provocation" and "preparation for invasion".
North Korea on Friday called for a renewal of its nuclear program if Washington does not lift economic sanctions on Pyongyang.
Such a change of course could be “strictly considered,” North Korea’s foreign ministry said.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a televised interview that the sanctions would remain until Pyongyang gave up nuclear weapons.
At the same time, he announced that he would meet with North Korean envoy Kim Yong-chol in New York this week.

Eastern European Studies Centre to Collaborate with Two Major US "Smart Centers"
According to Lino Kojala, head of the RESC, who is based in Vilnius and has been operating for thirteen years, the U.S. will enable the implementation of projects and will make Lithuania’s voice more heard on the other side of the Atlantic.
“We have been working in this direction for several months.
I am pleased that the two major institutions see us as partners and are looking for opportunities for joint action.
I have no doubt that niche activities will emerge, as the issues of NATO, security, disinformation and the development of Eastern Partnership countries that we are analyzing are also a priority for them," Kojala said.
The agreements noted that the RESC and the US authorities will work together to prepare applications for international projects, exchange of expertise and expertise, and prepare expert visits.
This should be especially useful for Lithuanian analysts, because both partners have a great international reputation.
The FPRI has been in operation since 1955, bringing together nearly a hundred top-level analysts.
FPRI ranked seventh in its category in the latest global ranking of analytical centers at the University of Pennsylvania.
At the time, the CEPA, whose analysts have been repeatedly invited to consult and work in the top U.S. political institutions, was ranked ten in the same category.
"This will give more opportunities for Lithuanian analysts working in various institutions to get into the US information space and will encourage us to raise the quality cartel," Kojala added.
One of the first practical steps should be to help partners distribute the forthcoming analytical edition of the Lithuanian Foreign Policy Review (RESC) among U.S. decision makers and in public space.
The Centre for Eastern European Studies operates on the basis of projects implemented and no targeted grants are maintained.
Among the partners with which joint initiatives are implemented are the European Commission, NATO, USAID, various international funds, etc.
The building collapsed in Marseilles
Two buildings in the southern French city of Marseille were damaged by two people, the fire department said on Monday.
As the buildings collapsed on the street, the clouds of dust rose.
Dozens of firefighters worked at the scene near the famous old port of Marseille, some - with trained dogs.
The local prefecture on Twitter posted photos showing a pile of cracks and wooden beams, a huge gap in the location where buildings were parked, fireworks at the scene and thick dust-covered cars.
Officials said they were looking for people who might have been found behind the wreckage.
The firefighters in Marseille said on Twitter that two people were being treated for minor injuries.
In an amateur video shown by BFM-TV, the dust clouds on the street and the handcuffs of passers-by were seen.
Google Street View photos taken before the incident showed that one of the buildings that collapsed were five and the other six.
One of these buildings was clearly in poor condition, covered with windows, with large façade cracks.
Mayor Sabine Bernasconi said one of the buildings was in poor condition and had been ordered to evacuate.
However, the mayor could not rule out the possibility that the building might have been arbitrarily used by people who lived there.
The Prefecture of the region called on the people to avoid the area and to release roads to the rescue services.
Marseille's Mayor Sabine Bernascon said the building was in poor condition and had been ordered to evacuate.

39-year-old mayor of Norto Ogden, north of Salt Lake City, Brent Taylor had taken a year-long vacation to carry out a mission in Afghanistan.
He was a military intelligence officer at the United Forces headquarters, but had to return to work as mayor in January.
