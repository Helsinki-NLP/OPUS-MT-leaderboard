Emeli Kouki led Hurricane home opening - Savo Volley's second win
The Hurricane-Loimaa, who won the Men's Volleyball Championship medals seven times in a row, started the 2018-19 home run, when Raision Loimu fell 3-0 on Saturday.
Returning from Romania to Finland, general player Emeli Kouki was 22 points most effective in Hurricane.
There were some translations abroad, but they did not come true, and then came a call from Loima.
It was too early to get things done, Kouki said.
Like Kouki, Tomi Rumpunen also played in Loimus with Kouki support with 18 points.
The most effective of the guests was Samuli Kaislasalo, who played 17 points on a match-specific deal.
Winning the opening game is always important.
Many players also had experience from the other side, and it brought extra extra to the game.
Our game is not ready yet, but the continuation of the medal tube is, of course, the goal, Kouki said.
Savo Volley's Most Powerful Measurement
Miro M<0xC3><0xA6>tänen was Savo Volley's most effective 18 points when the team dropped by Vieremä Vanta Ducks 3-0.
We played very nicely, especially in the attacking season, but fortunately we got a squeezed win.
“I didn’t have at least any consciously different downloads when I played against my former team,” M<0xC3><0xA6>ättanen said.
Antti Siltala, who started his career in the 2000–01 season in the Four Seasons Volleyball, scored 12 points.
Coach Jukka Tuovinen was pleased with many things.
The room was small, the atmosphere on the roof all the time.
A good friend left for home leave.
Miro was a king, Sillikin played a good game, Tuovinen said.
The previous season of Bridgela in the league was 2006-07, when he won silver in Pielaveden in Sammos Tuovysen as the head coach at the time.
Thiago Maciel was Ducks' most powerful 14 points.
Mikkonen again star of Akaa-Volley
Joni Mikkonen, who won the 2012–13 season, has also started this season strongly.
Hakkuri scored 25 points when Akaa-Volley took his opening win of the season after dropping the Kokkola Tiggers 3-2.
The season has started on its own very well.
Today, of course, the loss was near, because we were the fourth loser in the 17-21.
A defeat was excavated, and the fifth came at the same time, Mikkonen said.
A few seasons ago, the most powerful of the tigers in the finals was the 28-point hacker Edvarts Buivids.
Countryman Aleksandrs Kudrjashovs supported by 17 points.
I didn't get a shot at the guy's hack, Mikkonen said.
Finland is the world's first in comparison to human capital
Finland is at the forefront of comparing human capital in the world, according to Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years, Finland was the first in statistics.
In 2016, the peak was almost the same as in 1990.
In the past, Finland was followed by Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands.
Later, the Netherlands placed one higher, and instead of Canada, Taiwan was found on the list.
In 2016, the worst were Niger and South Sudan.
Measuring human capital takes into account the level of education of the population, access to education, skills and health.
The World Bank has pointed out that human capital is linked to economic growth.
Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois kept Athletic in the race, the local game ended unpainted
Real Madrid’s goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois took to the scoring rounds, and the Madrid teams’ local game ended in an unpainted draw late Saturday in the Spanish Football League.
Atletico Madrid's Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were the closest goalscorers, but the Belgian guard Courtois managed to fight.
Courtois played at Atletico three times on loan while he was a Chelsea player.
In the beginning of the week, the FIFA International Football Association selected him as the goalkeeper of the year.
In Real Madrid, Gareth Bale scored the best goal, but his shot was over at the end of the opening round.
Bale left after the break because of the more traveling.
According to ESPN, disappointed supporters of Real in the match called Cristiano Ronaldo, who moved to Juventus.
U.S. Attacks on the Right to Abortion – Strong Document Tells Why
The U.S. Senate is currently trying to figure out whether one of the nine Supreme Court members could be elected by President Donald Trump’s nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In the Republican Party, many hope that Kavanaugh's decisive vote would bring down a decision against Roe known as Wade, which legalized abortion in the United States in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg's documentary Reversing Roe - The United States and the Rights of Abortion tells us how the situation has come to an end over the years.
As unbelievable as it may seem, the topic is also up-to-date in Finland.
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (sin) has done public work against safe abortion and has received various support from the majority of our country’s representatives.
At the beginning of the powerful document, you will meet gynecologist Colleen McNicholas, who is the only doctor in Missouri to perform abortions due to law enforcement.
An armed guard at the clinic says he defends U.S. freedom of religion.
News videos reminiscent of deadly attacks on clinics.
Let’s move to a time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
At that time, the Lutheran church leaders’ association guided women to reliable abortion doctors.
The reasoning of the questioned pastor is good, but in reality they are not even needed, a photo of a woman who died in an abortion herself is enough.
There were about 5,000 deaths in the U.S. every year.
The legalization of abortions was advocated by the Republican Party.
In 1967, the California abortion law was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan.
Later, Reagan, in his 1980 presidential campaign, began to inversely confuse religion with politics in search of voters.
His abortion campaign was also run by his successor George Bush.
And so did Donald Trump.
The document goes beyond the core of the matter in finding the basis for the politicization of abortion.
When racially discriminatory religious organizations were denied tax exemption, they became politically active.
Abortion was chosen as an abortion.
Religion has brought exceptional nudges into politics.
At the time of writing this in the U.S., there is a situation in which the sek is harassed by sexual harassment, but the votes of the right-wing religious party are stabbed by abortion, the president has chosen Kavanaugh as the highest court candidate, which many women are now accusing of sexual harassment.
Kavanaugh may have the power to decide on the rights of 164 million American women and girls.
Israeli army shoots seven Palestinians, including two children – large-scale protests at border
More than 200 Palestinians have been killed half a year after Israel fired protesters in the border zone.
Israeli soldiers shot down seven Palestinians in the Gaza border area on Friday, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, there are two children among the dead: 12- and 14-year-old boys.
According to the ministry, 505 people have been injured.
Of these, 89 were wounded.
The Israeli army has confirmed that it opened fire and launched an offensive against the border zone when the protesters threw Israeli troops with rocks and explosives.
The military says it has initiated the use of force, that the protesters will not disperse the border guard or seek it on the other side.
At least 191 Palestinians have died in Gaza protests since March, when Palestinians began weekly protests at the border.
According to the UN Human Rights Commissioner, there are 12,000 injured.
The protesters demanded that Palestinian families enter the territories from which the Palestinians had to leave when the Israeli state was established in 1948.
A Palestinian sniper has killed an Israeli soldier.
The explosions dropped by lions and helium balls sent from the Palestinian side have ignited forests and farmlands in Israel.
Teemu Pukki got a penalty pot - you weren't allowed to shoot yourself
Wigan's top partner, Chey Dunkley, seemed to have dropped him in the penalty area on the back of the deck.
Gavin Ward allowed the game to continue.
According to his interpretation, the roof was clean.
Teemu Pukki couldn't believe her eyes.
The situation seems to have been bothered by deputy judge Ward, who sentenced Norwich to a 85th minute penalty when Pukki was shot down.
Ward showed a penalty kick, and Mario Vrancic scored a 1-0 win.
He has scored five goals for Norwich in the championship series.
The previous one was born last Saturday against QPR stylishly on the chest muscle.
It tasted like working for Puk again.
After losing the ball, he continued until the end of the game.
He created painting situations and defended without being tired.
Norwich's match was five in two weeks.
The team will continue in the cup.
There's a five win tube behind.
Pedophiles' help service was filled with reservations immediately - in Finland about 40,000 people are interested in children
It is estimated that 2% of men and a small proportion of women experience at least some sexual interest in pregnancies.
In Finland, this means about 40,000 people.
To date, it has been difficult for children or young people who are sexually interested.
The joint SeriE project between the Criminal Assistance Foundation and Sexpo is designed to train professionals to meet pedophiles as clients and to help people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was reported in the spring, Sexpo, a consultant and therapist, began emailing and meeting times were booked very quickly, Yle says.
However, they are expected to be released in the autumn.
Sexual preference for children is a disgrace to many people.
Most of the pedophiles who perceive themselves have not realized their fantasies and thus have not done anything criminal.
Preference, however, is usually a permanent feature.
Most of them hope to get rid of the thoughts that distress and depress them.
They also complicate normal life, says Yle to sexual therapist Patricia Thesleff, who acts as a specialist in the project.
I think the work is valuable if one child is spared from sexual violence, Thesleff says.
Korean leaders or Congolese gynecologist?
US President Donald Trump as the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize - the idea may sound suddenly strange, but Trump is one of the biggest favourites to receive the award, according to the bookmaker.
Trump’s role in getting North Korea, at least at the level of talks, is to commit to nuclear disarmament.
The biggest recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize are South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who have already met three times this year and promised to pursue a peace deal between their countries.
The warming between the Koreans is significant, as even last year, the mid-summers were the monkeys.
Yet years of advancement in nuclear weapons and the award of Kim’s leading iron fissure would undoubtedly also raise criticism.
The winners of the Nobel Prize will be announced on Monday, and Friday will be the most-received, the Peace Prize.
If the award is not awarded to Korean semi-Korean diplomats, one of the top candidates is Congolese doctor Denis Mukwege.
A distinguished gynecologist has treated thousands of women victims of mass shootings in his hospital in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and has become the world’s leading expert in their field.
Mukwege has drawn attention to sexual violence, which is a karmic byproduct of many conflicts.
The UN refugee organization, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981, is also considered a strong candidate.
The Nobel Committee has said that 331 candidates will be awarded the prize this year.
The names of the candidates will not be disclosed to the public.
Trump himself wouldn’t have done anything wrong if he won the Nobel Prize.
In May, a reporter asked him at the White House if he believed he deserved a peace prize.
“Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it myself,” Trump said with a smile.
I want to finish this.
The prize I want is a victory for the whole world, the President continued, referring to the North Korean negotiations.
However, there are things that make Trump's Nobel improbable.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which decides on the prize, has often given recognition to individuals and organizations representing liberal democracy and a diverse world order – precisely the kind of international cooperation that Trump has been seen as opposed to.
In the 2000s, the award was awarded to three American politicians, all of whom were democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007, and Barack Obama in 2009.
Trump’s award would therefore require the Nobel Committee for an ideological full-fledged translation.
Fire announcement in the tunnel: Drivers behaved like suitcases and drove in the wrong direction
The traffic congestion in Lohja occurred on 8 September.
Traffic in the tunnel area was interrupted due to the announcement, both in the direction of Turu and Helsinki.
When it became clear that it was systemic, the fire department tried to make traffic normal.
However, it did not succeed very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Road Transport Center said that it cannot be opened because there are drivers on the road as well as pigs and they are driving how they hurt, firefighter Pasi Käläinäinen told the STT at the time.
The motorway was started at that time to drive even in the wrong direction after only a moment of waiting.
When the first one starts to act against traffic rules, a few others often follow, the head of traffic security, Tapio Heiskanen, is surprised.
According to traffic rules, motorways and tunnels must only be stopped for mandatory reasons.
Traffic safety reminds us that in exceptional circumstances, it is not possible to go out to jeopardise traffic with blocked solutions.
Alert vehicles must always provide the most unobstructed traffic.
In particular, driving in the opposite direction on the motorway is prohibited, as well as doing the u-translation and cancellation.
The same prohibitions apply in tunnels where the traffic lights must always be switched on.
Parking without compulsory reason is also prohibited, as is the case with parking.
Recently, there have even been cases where the driver has stopped in the tunnel to brush the snow from his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for this action, Heiskanen said in the Transport Safety Bulletin.
Ilves fans would have liked to continue celebrating even though the ship was trapped at the bottom of the lake.
The Ilves fans transported to Tampere would have wanted the ship to continue its victory celebration, even though the ship had been trapped in the bottom of the lake, says Juho Syrjä, who was the captain of the ship at the time of the event.
M/S Tampere, who was on his way from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, left his route late Saturday night and was trapped at the base of Vanajavede in Akaia.
19 passengers and five crew members were evacuated to the mainland at night.
No one was hurt in a buddy.
The Ilves fans would have liked to continue celebrating on the ship until morning, but of course it would have been more sensible to send them on firefighters’ boats to the port and bus home, Syrja told STT.
The Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna following the match between Ilveksen and HPK, which ended in Iveksen’s 4-3 win.
According to Syrja, on Saturday the harbor was due to the water surface in Vanajavede which was about half a meter lower than normal.
According to Syrja, navigation was also made difficult by the fact that the nearest sign was covered in logs, which is why its reflectors did not normally appear in the dark source.
No more collisions to mention
The friend happened on the western side of the narrow Jumusensalm shortly after the naval route had submerged the bridge between Tampere and Helsinki.
According to Syrja, there was no greater drama in the case, as the speed of the ship was very low at the time of the incident and the impact on the bottom did not lead to a more significant collision.
According to the border, the anchorage to the bottom has not caused any leaks or pressures, and with these apparently cruises continue as normal.
The diver went to check the condition of the ship on Saturday morning before the ship began to be pulled off from the ground.
For the sake of certainty, we are still on the ship to check that there has been no damage, Syrja says.
Syrjä believes that the cruise to M/S Tampere next weekend can be handled accordingly.
The cruise season of the ship will continue until Independence Day.
Not used for ambulances
The rescue agency received an alert on Saturday night just after 12:30 p.m.
Ambulances were alerted to receive evacuated passengers, but there was no use for ambulances.
Firefighter Matti Willman said late in the evening that the evacuation conditions at the lake were difficult due to the darkness and fairly strong wind.
The Pirkanmaa rescue agency reported on Sunday night that all those on board had been evacuated and passengers had been transported by bus to Tampere.
Built in 1957, the cruise line has been extinct in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
Trump’s prosecutor accused of harassment and kidnapping may lack the supremacy
Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court judge of the United States, may well be absent from the position he seeks, according to program director Mika Aaltola of the Foreign Policy Institute.
So far, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and misconduct during her studies.
According to the wave, the suspicions have brought so much political pressure on the Republican party that President Donald Trump may end up representing someone else.
In the U.S., it has sometimes been the case that the president’s nominee for Supreme Court judge has caused a lot of controversy.
In this case, the judge has usually withdrawn himself, says Aaltola.
This is how the president has been able to keep his face.
Nomination to the Lair of Democrats
The U.S. Supreme Court seeks to be above politics, but at least in the case of Kavanaugh, the election of a new judge has become a politically very sensitive process.
If Kavanaugh is appointed, the decision is likely to fall into the Democratic Party lair in the upcoming midterm elections in Congress.
It would raise the voting capability among young people and women who are more likely to vote for Democrats.
On the other hand, the appointment of a conservative judge to the Supreme Court would be a long-term victory for Republicans.
It is not an opportunity for every presidency to be appointed, because in the United States, Supreme Court judges are appointed for life.
In practice, some of them have retired at their own request at the age of 70-80.
Some Republicans have doubted the nomination.
The U.S. Supreme Court’s nominees are normally subject to a background examination, Aaltola says.
While Trump has ordered the FBI to be further investigated for only a week, it could still bring out something essential, according to Aaltola.
Yes, it can bring.
There is rarely smoke without fire, says Aaltola.
Well, at least it is certain that Kavanaugh's suitability or inappropriate position will still be debated vigorously before the Senate makes its decision.
Republicans in the Senate have a majority of 51-49, but at least two female Republican senators are suspected of Kavanaugh's nomination.
The most embarrassing thing would be that the nomination would be put to the vote and the Republicans would lose.
Woman Identifies Salisbury Suspect as Military Intelligence Agent
A Russian woman has told the BBC that she has identified Salisbury poisoning as an agent of the Russian military intelligence service suspect.
Based on the photos, the woman said that this was a military intelligence investigation by Anatoli Tshepiga, who works at the GRU.
The Bellingcat online community and the Russian community Insider Russia reported earlier that they had disclosed another suspected man’s poisoning to Tshepiga.
Already in the past, they said they have found evidence that men’s current identities are covert identities.
The BBC group traveled to the Far East near the village on the Russian-China border, where Tshepiga was born.
The woman in the village identified the photos of the young Tshepigan Bellingcat.
He identified the same man in British police photos showing a man named Ruslan Boshirovi.
Russians are suspected of poisoning former twin agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter with the Novitshok nerve poisoning in March.
The script survived.
Colonel Tshepiga was awarded, among other things, with the honor of the Russian hero in 2014.
Russia is still denying the suspected GRU connection.
The men suspected of poisoning said earlier in September in an interview with Russian television that they were tourists in Salisbury.
Older people in discarded bags in war reform
Now we have a living example of what the limiter for the change of the war reform, defined by the Civilian Government, in practice means.
The Vaala war services of my hometown are produced by the municipality of Oulukaare, whose health service director was elected in 2016 as Attendo’s former district manager.
The leaders of the municipal council warn the Board of Trustees of a change limiter.
If the cost of war increases now, the municipality’s state aid will be cut in the future.
The central decision makers of the municipality survived, and most of them are ready for a major restructuring of elderly care, which would put an end to the institutional care of the annual department of the health centre and a small unit of memory patients.
Home-hospital care would be added, which means long distances in the Vaal will mean that the elderly living in the remote village will have their roots on their shoulders next to the health centre to be treated as "home".
Attendo was confident that the municipality would pay for it by customers.
The Left of Vaal did not swallow a bad preparation, but organized a good public event, which became a large number of relatives, nurses and also delegates from other parties.
I presented war-country preparations on the issues of how the municipality of Vaala treats the elderly at home at the moment most throughout the North Pole.
Also included was the neighbourhood's delegate Carina Westeni.
The local newspaper made a big story about the opportunity, and it again raised the Oulunkara preparers to their backyards.
War-preparers do not write in any papers that Attendo has built a new nursing home in Vaalaa, which is now waiting for its empty residents.
There are no other service providers.
References are only about service appointments, but they do not tell you what levels of care it receives or what kind of staffing agency Attendo will take care of the elderly until they receive treatment.
Without a nurse?
This is because the health centre’s premises are closed because there is no doctor’s night shift.
Attendo will also resort to the doctors of the Vaala Health Centre.
The example of Vaal illustrates how central officials turn authorised officers over incomplete information and authorised officers are placed back against the wall with a change limiter.
In this way, the central party will evacuate the inhabitants of Vaal, because who will remain unsafe to live there voluntarily if there is an opportunity to move away.
Was there a single electoral clause in the center that the whole country was considered inhabited?
Turkish President Erdogan opens a mosque in Cologne
Thousands of people in the German city of Cologne showed up when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan opened the largest mosque in Europe.
Hundreds of people had gathered on the Rhine coast since morning.
Erdogan was not welcome, read the protesters’ colds, and the slogans condemned fascism.
During Erdogan’s visit on Thursday, a number of protests have been held and security measures have been strict.
In the streets of Cologne, some 10,000 people were expected to protest, among other things, the human rights situation in Turkey.
In the vicinity of the Grand Mosque, Erdogan’s supporters were also gathered.
However, police had isolated a large area of the mosque from the environment for security reasons.
In his opening speech, Erdogan praised the success of his visit to Germany and assessed the strengthening of relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit, Erdogan met Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
Erdogan and Merkel vowed on Friday to rebuild relations with the countries, which have deteriorated significantly since Turkey's 2016 coup attempt.
However, Merkel stressed that there are deep disagreements between the countries on human rights issues, among others.
The review surrounds the visit
Both Cologne Mayor Henriette Reker and North Rhine-Westphalia Prime Minister Armin Laschet cancelled their participation in the openings as criticism of Erdogan’s visit accelerated.
A 30-year-old student from Turkey, Cansu, said he came from Switzerland to protest against Erdogan.
I want to be a voice for those who cannot go to the streets in Turkey.
They have been arrested, murdered, and subjected.
For Erdogan, all that differs from his own thinking is terrorism.
In the final stage of Erdogan’s German journey in North Rhine-Westphalia, a significant part of the population is Turkic.
Three journalists charged with murder in Slovakia
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
The prosecutor said on Friday that three people were charged with the February murder of Kuciak and his fiancé, as well as other crimes.
Earlier this week, police arrested eight people in the murder investigation, but five of them have been released.
Kuciak was found home in Bratislava in February when he was shot with his fiancé.
He had studied the connections between politicians and the Italian mafia.
Police are suspected of involvement in Kuciak's investigations into the murders.
The case and the article published by Kuciak have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
There may be problems in the distribution of cattle on Sunday in the dispersed areas
Due to the print error, Karjalainen will also have to be posted on Sunday as unaddressed.
This may appear in the distribution of the magazine in the distribution areas where the distribution to the joint boxes is required from external memory.
The situation was the same for the newspaper on Saturday, and the problem may continue on Monday.
The poster puts additional leaflets in the county.
The newspapers of other Finnish subscribers will be published separately only on Monday.
The distribution of these magazines is significantly delayed.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut.
Reporter Arto Nyberg will be interviewing Vesa Heilala in his upcoming live talk programme today.
Vesa is in the studio telling of her upcoming space trip, which she booked from Virgin Galactica in 2010.
The price was <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>151,000, which was required as a bank loan.
If the original plans had been true, Vesa would have been in space a long time ago.
However, the date of departure has been postponed year by year.
It now seems that after the failure, which occurred in 2014, and the death toll required, things are on the verge of failing.
If all goes well, commercial flights will begin again this year or at the latest next year.
The flight number of Vesa is 300, which means that his journey is scheduled for about a year after the first departure.
The flight lasts 2.5 hours and is 5 minutes at a height of 100 kilometres in unweighted condition, the Finnish astronaut says on his upcoming website.
In the same address, he also backs up his cravings for space.
As a child, I read a comic book called Space Travel and watched the Star Trek TV series.
The Star Wars has been seen, and that's why the idea has become...
Why not?
Everyone has their own dreams.
Manchester City was a quiet host.
Manchester City continued their lossless run in the Champions League when it dropped 2-0 to Brighton on Saturday.
Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero are the winners of the sixth victory of the ruling championship.
Sterling was able to drive his fourth hit of the season from near distance to empty goal when Leroy Sané found him in the 30th minute of Brighton's goal at the rear pole.
Agüero raised his painting pool to five when he saw Sterling with Brighton in the 65th game.
The Argentine managed to place 2-0 finals against the penalty shootout easily.
With six wins and one draw, City has started the season to lead the Valioliga with 19 points.
However, Liverpool, who played less than one game, lost only one point away.
On Saturday night, Liverpool will face Chelsea in their seventh round of the series.
Youth associations selected new decision-makers in Joensuu
The Finnish Youth Association selected new decision-makers for the next three-year period for 2019-2021 at its meeting on Sunday.
Anu Sivonen from Yälä-Savo was elected as Chairman and Petra Mäkeläinen Hämee as Vice-President.
The Board of Directors was elected 40 actual members and 40 deputy members, Finnish Youth Associations informs on Sunday.
The youth meeting was held in Joensuu.
We want our cultural hobby activities to be known for quality and safety.
The Youth Meeting, organised in partnership, makes three promises in its three-year operational objectives: We keep the doors open to all, and we organise recreational activities regardless of their place of residence and background, and we support volunteering activities, collecting volunteers and taking care of their own people.
Lewis Hamilton praised Kim Räikkö and surprised Ferrari: "He misses a very important driver"
In an interview with Swiss magazine Blick, Mersun was asked if he believed Kim Räikköse’s release from Ferrari’s services would help Hamilton in the final season.
Hamilton leads Ferrari's second runner-up Sebastian Vettel in the World Cup with 40 points.
A little less than three weeks ago, Ferrari said that Räikkönen will not continue in the castle next season and Räikkönen announced that it will move to Sauber.
Hamilton, of course, does not believe that Räikkönen would hit gloves on the plate.
I don't think Kimi will change in the remaining games.
He's an exceptional professional - a fantastic driver.
He remains one of my favorite drivers and I am convinced that Ferrari will lose a very important driver.
That doesn't make sense to me.
Hamilton has previously said that Räikkönen has been one of his predecessors.
I don’t know if Kim knows this, but when I was young and I had the fantasy formula one, I played the F1 game on PlayStation every day.
“I’ve always been Kimi, which is kind of crazy,” Hamilton said in June.
The F1 season will continue with the Russian competition on Sunday.
Starting at 14:00, the race starts at Valtteri Bottas, Mercedeksen.
The night is followed by the moment of the competition.
The SM-series youth football championship became a complete farce: the opponent came in with only 7 players
The soccer boys’ top level ends on Saturday, with the final round of the season being played.
Before 13:00, the starting points for the championship match were clear: FC Lahti is practically a point enough for the first place against Vasa IFK.
In order to reverse the situation in the last round, Ilveksen, the second in the championship match, must win the PK-35 and hope for a loss of the batsmen.
However, the Lahti championship was practically ensured even before the start, as Vasa IFK had arrived at Lahti with only seven players.
If there were less of them, the game could not have started.
FC Lahti Academy won the match 16-0.
On the back, the Bayers led 7-0.
One reason for the loss of Basque players is that the team has played partly with the same players in the A-Youth SM Series, the P20 Series and the men's C-Box.
Vasa IFK has played in the Second in practice against the fall of the entire season.
In the second round on Saturday, Vasa IFK is forced to win the JBK in the guest match and at the same time hopes that Tampere United will lose its own guest match against KuFua in the Siilinjärvi Toivala.
The car ended up on the rooftop in Enos - according to the rescue agency, happiness was involved
The passenger car drove off the road and ended up on the rooftop at Eno’s Juttuvaarntia on Sunday at 9 a.m.
There were four people involved in the accident.
Two of them were slightly injured, the rescue agency said.
Good luck, he said in the press release.
According to the rescue agency, the road was wet after rain.
The police were at the scene of the accident.
Supo awaits new means of inquiry: equipment procurement and recruitment already done, planning activities abroad will not skip
According to Supon chief Antti Peltari, the Intelligence Act has been prepared by making equipment purchases and training staff.
With the entry into force of the Intelligence Act, the budget of the soup should be permanently increased by around EUR 10 million.
The security police (supon) offices in Helsinki Ratakadu are already preparing for the full entry into force of the Intelligence Act.
Antti Pelttari, chief of the collection of Supon, told Western Media that equipment procurement has already been made for future intelligence powers.
Serena Williams is shocked by a video in which she sings in topless – campaigning for breast cancer awareness
Tennis superstar Serena Williams is back.
Now she has campaigned to raise awareness of breast cancer by publishing a video on her Instagram account where she sings only her hands in front of her breasts, AFP reports.
The song was released in 1991 by The Divinyls in Australia with the hit I Touch Myself.
Williams supports the activities of the Australian Breast Cancer Association.
“I voted for The Divinyls’ global hit to remind women to do regular self-examinations,” Williams wrote in an Instagram post.
And yes, this put me in the discomfort zone, but I wanted to do it because the topic touches all women regardless of skin color all over the world.
Timely detection is everything a and o - it spoils many lives.
The second author of The Divinyls is Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago at the age of 53.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project, which was made in honor of Chrissy Amphlett.
“He died of breast cancer but gave us a hit song to remind women to prioritize their health,” Williams says.
The video has been viewed 1.5 million times.
It was published early Sunday morning.
In the video, Williams is praised for his courage.
Williams left the Beijing tennis tournament earlier this week.
There's a lot behind the US Open tennis tournament three weeks ago.
Williams fired at the game's chief judge, saying, among other things, that men are accepted much more aggressively than women's players.
Chinese restaurant on the mountain trail is not suitable for high-rise rooms
In addition to traditional Chinese delicacies, the restaurant serves stunning landscapes.
An exceptional restaurant has been opened in Zhejiang Province of China.
It is literally located at the edge of the rock.
From there, you can watch the forest spreading below.
The scenic landscapes at the heights will get restaurant visitors to breathe in the Longquan Mountains.
Access to the restaurant requires walking in the middle of the peanut trees.
The restaurant opened for hikers on 19.9.2018.
Youtube comments wonder where the restaurant’s toilet is located.
Walking to the restaurant requires a good basic exercise, the place will be told.
This is the end of the day: This is how it ends.
Everything good ends in time.
Today, this is what happens to the domestic landscape drama of Korpela, which has been quite held.
The third production season has gone like hot rocks: last week the episode was watched by 722,000 Finns on television for the first time.
The top pages themselves no longer have any practical significance, because Heikki Luoman and Jukka Mäkisen series will not be a sequel.
In the final season, Jaska and Mirku are again taking the lead, and Jaska's mother seems to be the first to guess what's going to happen.
Both Anss and Miisa are warm, romantic in light of recent events, but then Laiho appears again in the patterns.
The police are also suspicious of the man.
No one knows the fate of the lion in advance.
Anita, in turn, hears incredible news.
The final will of the distance is revealed, which brings a woman to the brink of tears.
A week later, on Sunday evenings, the latest episodes of Sorionen will continue.
The choir runs on TV1 today at 9:05 p.m.
Is it worth going to work tomorrow with a small flu?
Here are the facts for and against
The flu season is hot.
A lot of people want to stay home or not.
However, the unemployment rate is worth considering whether it is worth going to infect others, as the disease can be contagious even if the symptoms are small.
Sometimes the symptoms of the flu suddenly strike, sometimes they appear with fungus.
In the latter option, you may already infect others, even if your symptoms feel small, says Prevention.
Is it worth staying at home?
Prevention suggests that the flu is contagious even when the person has no symptoms.
The virus is already infected a day before the symptoms begin and from five days to a week.
Children may become infected with the disease for longer.
As soon as you recognize the symptoms, you should not be at school or at work.
You can go back to work when the cough is mild and the fever is gone, says Gregory Poland, professor of medicine.
Exercise should also be avoided.
Too fast return to the hall to slow the recovery.
In addition, wash your hands, moisten your nail polish and throw the scraper papers in the trash.
Painful move, though?
If you have to leave home sick, consider using a protective mask.
The mask does not keep the virus in check, but keeps the user aware of the area of the head.
Then the fingers should not be put in the nose or mouth, Poland says.
There are also limitations on the mask.
So how can we avoid infected people?
The best way is to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
The latter, however, is difficult to avoid.
For example, in the United States, the average person touches his eyes, nose or mouth every 15-30 seconds, Poland warns.
New Miss Finland repeats Mississippi tradition: "My husband is an ice hockey player"
Ice hockey player and misses are often combined with each other.
This was also the case with Alina Voronkova, 23.
Alina Voronkova, from Pertunmaa, has been awarded the Miss Finnish Crown for 2018.
She now lives in Lahti, where she moved at the age of 15.
Alina's mother is an Inker Finnish and her father is a Russian.
Voronkova was bullied at school because of his father’s Russianness.
My mom and dad moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was bullied because of my Russian identity.
I didn’t have any friends in Pertun, Alina tells me in the semifinalists of the Miss Finland.
After graduation, Alina decided to start off from a clean table and move on to Latte to attend high school.
Soon the Mississippi singer found new friends and the coffin started rolling hopefully.
When I was 15, I thought I was an adult, but after that I wasn’t.
Three years ago, Alina met her current partner, Jonas Hurrin, who is familiar with the ranks of Pelican.
After a career in the SM League, the ice hockey player has played abroad, such as in Sweden and China.
In 2009 he was in the Finnish team at the 18-year-old World Cup.
At the beginning of the dating, the couple lived in a close relationship for almost a year, but later Alina was able to travel the world with her husband.
If I got to the winner's third and that would boost my career, I don't want to believe it would affect our relationship in any way.
Even if we had to live separately, so we have confidence working well and in the distance it is the good side that it stays on top of the whole time, Alina whispered in May.
<0xE2><0x99><0xAA> <0xE2><0x99><0xAA> <0xE2><0x99><0xAA> <0xE2><0x99><0xAA> <0xE2><0x99><0xAA> <0xE2><0x99><0xAA> <0xE2><0x99><0xAA> <0xE2><0x99><0xAA> <0xE2><0x99><0xAA> <0xE2><0x99><0xAA> <0xE2><0x99><0xAA> <0xE2><0x99><0xAA> <0xE2><0x99><0xAA> <0xE2><0x99><0xAA> <0xE2><0x99><0xAA> <0xE2><0x99><0xAA> <0xE2><0x99><0xAA>
Almost everyone is concerned about the sustainability of the planet.
However, almost nothing is wanted to give up.
Sustainable alternatives are being sought for continuous growth, but even the theory of a reasonable economy encounters major problems.
The continuous growth of the economy has brought ordinary people, especially in the northern hemisphere, a standard of living from which before only dreams were possible.
However, the long-standing surplus of the Earth’s portability and climate change are threatening to undermine this market economy.
Two men were stabbed on Sunday night at Kannelmä Sittator at four in the morning.
The man who was born in 1986 was seriously injured in a car accident and the second, born in 1968, was milder.
One of the older men has already left the hospital.
Police have arrested a person who may have been involved in the shooting.
Police are also looking for another suspect in connection with the incident.
Events are investigated as an attempted murder and brutal abuse.

At the guest house, the Maarianhamina people made the difference in two points at the Turun Palloseua, located in the village.
An important painting and a valuable point, the chief coach of Marianham, Peter Lundberg.
Lundberg said, however, that the team did not ignite in the fight he expected.
We made a lot of mistakes during the opening season, but fortunately the Turkish paint brought us closer to the game.
Inter head coach John Allen said the game was in control, but the draw again caused pain.
One defensive mistake took us a full pot, Allen harbored.
We were the best again!

New image shows change: the world's strongest man lost dozens of pounds
In 2017, Eddie Hall, crowned the strongest man in the world, undergoes a dramatic transformation.
British Eddie Hall has been searching for the title of the strongest man in the world for a long and determined time.
Hall was able to eat up to 10,000 kilocalories per day for food and weighed 200 kilograms at its largest, according to the Mirror magazine.
The shirts were size 5XL.
Hall admitted before winning the title that he had damaged his body.
The human body is not created to be of this size, Hall said.
The British hunted for the victory of the strongest man in the world by all means, and a family man promised to end his career if he got the title.
Hall did not want his children to grow up without a father.
Hall kept his promise and was no longer seen at the 2018 World's Strongest Man Games in April.
Recently, Hall posted a picture on Instagram in which he poses his active tracking in a slower state.
Hall writes that his current weight is 169.5 kilograms.
Hall wrote that he currently exercised five times a week in an aerobic manner.
The program includes, among other things, diving, cycling and swimming.
In addition, Hall does four exercises a week in the gym.
This year, the strongest man in the world was the Icelandic player, Haf<0xC3><0xB2>r Július Björnsson, who became known for the television series Game of Thrones.
The previous Finnish winner of the competition is Janne Virtanen, who was the first in 2000.
Restaurant Lalaiva M/S Tampere roared in Pyhäjärv - "Supportively stuck with a stone"
The M/S Tampere Indoor Sailing was driving late Friday night at Akaala Pyhäjärvi.
The rescue agency received a warning of a water accident on Friday night after 12:30 p.m.
The 30-metre M/S Tampere ship has committed a crime, and is firmly attached to its cylinder with a stone, described firefighter Matti Willman.
There were 19 passengers and five crew members on board.
According to the rescue agency, injuries were avoided.
Passengers and almost all crew members have been evacuated to the mainland from the ship.
Now they are being transported by a bus station to Tampere, Jari Nieminen told STT at 1 p.m.
Ambulances were alerted to take evacuated passengers to the port of Viiala.
For some reason, the ship travelling from Hämeenlinna to Tampere had departed from its route on the western side of the narrow Jumusensalm.
Police are investigating the cause of the incident.
Firefighter Matti Willman said earlier in the evening that the conditions at the lake are difficult because of the darkness and fairly strong wind.
According to the rescue agency, the fate of the ship is unclear.
Apparently the ship doesn't run out.
After the evacuation operation, divers will begin to check the situation at the bottom.
Built in 1957, M/S Tampere is now a restaurant-boat with a maximum passenger capacity of 180.
The ship also has a private leased meeting room.
According to the ship’s website, the cruiser was extinct in 2001, 2014 and 2017.

Previous Previous post: Ex-Managers Call Robert Helen for Unpaid Fees
Robert Helenius's night game against Erkan Teper is a shadow of the raws.
Itta-Sanomat today announced the challenge filed by Jaakko Helmis and Jussi Kokkila, the deputy judge, in which Heleniuks is charged a total of over 80,000 unpaid managerial fees.
According to the challenge application, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Heleniks on 15.4.2014-30.1.2015.
We've tried to agree, but there's no other option.
There has been a clear mandate here, and a lot of work has been done, Kokkila tells Itta-Sanom.
The current manager of Helenius, Markus Sundman, sent an answer to Ittelhehde, which tells about the events the player’s point of view.
Helenius denies being obliged to pay the required amount.
According to the answer, Kokkila and Helminen had provided their services to Helenius in a financially troubled situation and promised to arrange matches and sponsorship income for him.
It was agreed verbally that Helenius is obliged to pay only percentages of the fees for the match.
Repeatedly it was assured that Helenius did not have to pay anything, only to receive the income they organized.
This is also normal and the only practice in the management of professional athletes.
There has never been an agreement on pay cuts and such would have been absurd in Helenius’ situation, Sundman explains in the message he was preparing.
There has never been a written agreement on cooperation.
In response, Helenius said he would have wanted to agree on the distribution of income in writing from the outset, but Kokkila and Sundman did not receive the draft until the end of 2014.
He said the proposal was bad for himself and cut off cooperation with Kokkila and Helmis.
Helenius did not say anything when he was dealing with Kokkila and Helmis.
A year after the end of the cooperation, Heleniks was shown an "unindividual but substantial" invoice from the manager's work.
This year, the same allegations have been raised.
Helenius considers the posthumous activities of Helmis and Kokkila to be vicious, the answer is stated.
Helenius is today faced by the IBF's boxing union Erkan Teper, the seventh challenger in the heavyweight series in Stuttgart.
A good man and a good reporter
Entertainment artist and music producer Ilkka "Ile" Vainio knew the late radio host and journalist Erkki Päll for decades.
The long-range radio host and journalist Erkki Paläli died at the age of 83 from unhealed liver cancer.
The announcement of the executioner’s death was published on Sunday in Helsinki’s Sanom.
The announcement says that Päll died on September 3.
Pälli reported a serious illness on his Facebook page in March 2018.
The publication was also seen at that time by Ile Vainio, who was killed by the knowledge of his destiny.
He left on Facebook earlier as farewell, Ile Vainio says.
Vaino considers Erkki Päll a multi-gift expert, who became a great journalist.
He remembers Päll being a man who had quick hoxs and fun stuff.
I met Erk when I was a little boy when I first visited Finnley at the age of 12 and started there as a warehouseman.
We met Erk at the time.
He was a Finnlevy informant at the time and in various positions, Ile Vainio recalls.
When I went on to make records as a music producer, there were hundreds of occasions where Erkki Pälli was a standard reporter for all the artists at the festival.
He was always an expert and saw how much fire he had on entertainment, music and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he got straight into the skin of the interviewees.
He was a good man and a good reporter.
He became known to many as a respected Yle radio presenter, but he also wrote great news stories.
Erkki interviewed me several times.
He was very good at talking, I'm glad.
For decades, Pälli worked as a journalist in the Fazer-disc company with Espero Kärje.
He worked as a music producer on Vesa-Matti Loir's records.
However, Päll’s greatest passion was radio work, with his own style.
He has been doing radio work since the 1960s, and he became known to many listeners in the Yle ether.
He retired in 1998.
The Finnish Ski Federation reported on Saturday that the association’s financial year ending in May showed a profit of around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>450,000.
The union describes its economic situation as a "full-turn", although of course the economy is burdened by "significant balance sheet debt".
Chief Executive Officer Mika Kulmala encourages a quick response and a rigorous economic crisis.
We reacted to the situation last autumn by taking adaptation measures as quickly as possible.
The careful planning and financial management of the operation has spread throughout our organization, says Kulmala in the press release.
We have also been very successful in partner procurement and, in addition, the World Cup yield was the maximum during the past competitive season.
However, in the future, cost management needs to be rigorous, and at the same time we need to constantly look for new financial models.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
Dozens of bodies are lying in the backyard of the hospital in the town of Pulu on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Only one building separates them from the area in which the injured survivors have been assembled to assess the need for injury and treatment.
Patients are also treated outside for post-convulsions.
One of the men in the hospital area was a 52-year-old Baharuddin who was looking for his son.
Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
I have one child, and he's missing.
I spoke to him the last time he was going to school, Baharuddin told AFP.
Dwi Haris, who suffered injuries to his back and arm, was lying in the courtyard of the army hospital in Palu.
He was at the beginning of the riot at a local hotel with his wife and daughter.
The family was invited to Palu's wedding party.
I probably got into compressions under the wall that collapsed.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him and my son.
"I hope they're safe," Haris told AP, according to British radio stations.
Small shops are being robbed
At the evacuation center, a 35-year-old baby’s mother, Risa Kusuma, tried to calm down her hot baby.
He described the atmosphere in the city as tense.
There is little clean water.
Small shops are being robbed everywhere, Kusuma said.
Many residents have slept outside or in temporary bamboo houses.
Even if the house was somehow standing, the possible aftermath could destroy it permanently and bury the residents alone.
According to AP, more than half of the prisoners in the prison fled after the walls of the prison collapsed.
There were about 560 prisoners, so there were probably about 300 fugitives.
Some of the prisoners in Donggala prison have also been killed, reports The Jakarta Post.
According to the newspaper, the prisoners became angry and set the prison on fire after the guards had prevented them from leaving to search for their relatives suffering from the earthquake and tsunami.
The airport is reopened mainly for aid flights.
Among the first to land on the field was an army C-130 transporter, which brought aid supplies.
Commercial flights to the field Please be allowed only limited.
The pilots have to land on the ground without the help of air control, as the air control tower was badly damaged in the earthquake.
Rain blows over Finland at night
A long rainy area spread across the country on Sunday night from the west, according to the Meteorological Sciences Institute.
Rain comes mostly with water, but in Central and Northern Lapland it is expected to rain or snow.
Last night's packets are not repeated, as temperatures below cloud cover remain higher.
The cloudy night keeps the lowest temperatures quite efficiently at bay.
Just in the west can be visited for a moment on the side of the package, said up-to-date meteorologist Ville Ilkka.
On Sunday, the rainy area will be shifting eastwards in the morning.
In the south and west, there are swamps or semi-clouds.
In the afternoon temperatures always move up to the height of Oulu by 10-13 degrees.
The beginning of the week looks similar in terms of temperatures in the southern and central parts of the country, but the weather becomes more volatile.
Sea areas have wind and wave warnings in place.
The actual autumn storms are not expected in the coming days, but otherwise the license has a typical autumn weather variability.
“It’s going to be a big fall now,” he said.

We wanted him to go to college before going to Mississippi.
Russian father Dimitri and Ingerian mother Svetlana believed their daughter's success in the Miss Finland final.
The parents of the new Miss Finland Alina Voronkova, Dimitri Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkova, proudly followed their daughter for the first time on the crown.
They spooked the audience from Pertunland and were planning to drive back home after the final.
It's a lovely atmosphere!
We believed Erika all the time, but half an hour before the result, Svetlana laughed.
Svetlana is Anker and Dimitri is Russian.
Alina speaks russian, even though she has lived in Finland all her childhood.
Svetlana says Alina was more interested in acting and many other things than Miss’s career as a kid.
Alina was often told that when she was so nice, she should start missing.
But he said he wanted to be a radio presenter.
It was only later that Alina got excited about the beauty contests.
My parents’ hope was that Alina would enter the university before taking part in the Miss Finland competition.
This happened, and Alina eventually still wanted to graduate before the mississippi.
We already asked him last year why he didn’t participate, but he wanted to make it ready for him.
Parents believe that Alina won the race because it is a healthy example for young people and adults as well.
He plays a lot of sports and eats healthy.
And Alina likes to be on the lookout.
Alina's boyfriend Joonas Hurri is playing ice hockey in Japan and has not been able to encourage his loved ones in the final.
Alina’s parents believe that the relationship of the young will last a mission year.
Yeah, that's what it's meant!
My parents hoped that my daughter would come soon.
It’s been a long time since the visit due to mischievous symptoms.
I am sorry, even though messages have been sent.
A young man died in a riot in Lahti - police arrested three people

Sari Piippo left her career in Brussels and became a housewife in Finland - the idea of the cartoon came to mind: lack of drawing skills did not slow down
My husband’s statement, in which he suggested it as a personal story I developed, tells Espoléonian cartoon blogger, housewife and former EU translator Sari Piippo.
Sari Piippo says he was in Brussels as an EU translator until after the fourth child, the family became a returnee ten years ago.
I have enjoyed being a housewife very well.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point it came to mind what the big one would do when even the smallest child started to grow up.
Then, in 2014, a cartoon was created.
Piippo tells us that he had never dreamed of making a cartoon, even though he had read Aku Ankka, Tint and Asterix as a child.
I had painted as a child the last time, but when these manuscripts of the Man of Creation began to come about, the situation changed.
First of all, I made a few dozen manuscripts in the desk box.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (b. 2000) is a skilled drawer, but I didn’t get her to be attracted until in the summer of 2016, when I donated Viivi with the help of a drawing board.
His enthusiasm lasted about a dozen strips, and then he had to start trying himself, laughing at Piippo, who tells him that the drawing board was a great motivator.
The drawing board is an easy and convenient tool to try to get something early.
I didn’t even try to draw on paper, says Piippo about his relationship with drawing, which he usually practises in the evening.
Manuscripts always pop up in my mind, but I usually don't make them at once.
One three-screen strip takes up to several hours.
I can make a screen at once and I like to play with colors.
Starting drawing is always the hardest, because drawing is not the strongest type.
Sari Piippo says he appreciates the current series of newspapers, including Scott Adams Dilbert.
The characters of the Organic Pomegranate are a carrot-like mother who has a salad tea.
Other people include Man, Piss and Twins.
In the natural world, man is what he eats.
The ideas of the series come from your own life and social media.
Sari Piippo does not want to preach or offer a compulsory bottle, even though he occasionally finds it difficult to do so.
Piippo says she reads her series with her husband and children.
It’s a great feeling to look at the cartoon and say that this is what I’ve done today.
There are plenty of challenges for the housewife!

Indonesia Earthquake: Flight Leader Sacrifices Himself - Didn't Leave a Breaking Tower Before Getting Hundreds of Passengers Safe
Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21, has become the hero of the Indonesian earthquake.
Agung was left alone at the air traffic control tower until hundreds of people were transported to safely travel from the most devastated island of the earthquake.
The young man was in turn at the airline at Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport in the city of Palu when the earthquake struck on Friday.
Agung refused to leave his seat while fleeing from the airliner of the Batik Air passenger jet.
He was able to save hundreds of lives, the Indonesian aviation ministry told AFP.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie Airport on Saturday after the earthquake.
The airliner was broken and broken.
Eventually Agung tried to save himself by jumping from the fourth floor of the tower.
His leg was broken and he suffered severe internal injuries.
Agung was taken to a nearby hospital.
He was supposed to be transported by helicopter to a better equipped facility, but he died 20 minutes before the helicopter arrived, an aviation official told The Jakarta Post.
The sequence continued to intensify after the flight entered the air, and its strength was eventually measured by 7.5 magnitudes.
At least 832 people lost their lives.
The Indonesian Aviation Administration has respected Agung’s heroism on social media.
Rehn's view on the European end of the trade war: "We need to look at the next tweet"
The trade war between the United States and China is reflected in the global economy.
Throughout Europe, growth forecasts have been calculated and the Bank of Finland has also slightly reduced its own economic forecasts.
President-General Olli Rehn said in the first hour of Yle that while the escalating tension does not have a direct impact on European trade flows, it weakens confidence, which in turn reflects the investment decisions of companies.
The same applies to the exports of Finnish companies.
Mr Rehn believes that Europe is so far a good breadwinner.
It has been able to build peace with the United States and has helped to calm the situation with China and Japan.
Europe does not appear to be at the foot of a trade war.
You have to look at the next tweet and evaluate it afterwards.
We have an unpredictable partner in the direction of Washington, however, he said in an interview with Ylen.
Europe also has its own risks.
One of them is the third largest economy in the euro area, Italy, which is also one of the most indebted countries in the euro area and the entire Western world.
Yesterday, the Italian government reacted vigorously on Thursday evening to a clear presentation of the deficit budget.
Next year’s deficit is more than 2.4% of the national product.
Rehn is concerned about the situation in Italy.
Five per cent of the country’s loans are problem loans and more than ten per cent of unordered loans.
In addition, its public finances are in a weak position and the country is once again showing its commitment to its European partners.
Perhaps it is not worth painting new crises, Rehn replied when asked if Italy would bring Europe into a new economic crisis.
Another thing that testifies to Europe is the difference between Britain and the EU.
Rehn hoped it would be okay.
The difference in the dispute would have a much more negative effect.
Rehn started as CEO of the Bank of Finland in July.
Mario Draghi, the CEO of the European Central Bank (ECB), will resign after a fair year.
The conversation with his successor has begun.
Both Rehn and his predecessor Erkki Liikasen's name has been worn out in speeches.
It will probably not be a problem if Finnish names are included, Rehn said and added that he will not comment on this further.
HS’s super-popular Black Box show continues next week – the last tickets to Helsinki are on sale
The popular Black Box presentations organised by the Sanomai in Helsinki will resume in the beginning of the week.
The other shows will be seen at the National Theatre on October 2, 8 and 11.
On October 23, the Black Box will visit the Tampere Theatre for the first time.
There are still some tickets for the National Theatre.
The show in Tampere has been sold out.
Tickets are sold at Flagpu.fi.
During the evening, journalists and photographers on stage tell a long-prepared true story that has never been published in any HS instrument.
Again, there’s something that no one has ever heard of.
“There is a strange spy on the night of Helsinki, an impressive report from the other side of the globe and a talking story about a very current health issue,” says Esa Lilja, one of the producers of the Black Box.
After the presentation, the audience will have the opportunity to meet HS journalists and photographers and continue the discussion.
The Sanomat of Helsinki has been organizing the evenings of living journalism for three years.
They have been popular from the beginning and often sold out.
We have seen more than 15,000 people.
The black box was awarded a journalistic act of the year in Bonnier Gaal.
The awardees thanked the new way of journalism and the journalists wanted to get closer to their readers.
Spring 2019 Black Box will be seen at the National Theatre in March-April.
The show will also be visited in Tampere and Turus.
The show we saw at that time has a different content than this autumn's evenings.
Missing mushroom found due to "unpredictable experiment"
Finnish Police Drone Skills Top of the World: "We Are Asked About Training"
According to the director of the Police College, the police can use the drone in addition to searching for missing persons, for example, in crime scene investigations and intelligence.
On Tuesday, police in Oulu were able to find the missing sponge drone in Raahe in just a few minutes.
Kimmo Himberg, the director of Police College, tweeted about the case, noting that "with unprecedented experimentation and effective education, we are also at the forefront of the world".
The drone is a very new wardrobe and even more recent in police duties.
There is no statistic anywhere that the Finnish police would be a master of drone use.
According to Himberg, there is a strong notion that this is the case.
This has happened, for example, when the experiences of the Finnish police have been reported in international events.
There’s a lot of interest in it elsewhere, says Himberg.
It would be hard for visitors to watch the drone operation of the Finnish police.
We're being asked for training.
It gets more widespread.
Himberg reminds us that finding a missing person in Finland’s winter conditions as soon as possible is very important.
As noted, in the case of Raah, the missing were found using a drone in just a few minutes.
Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
According to Himberg, they are supposed to be trained more.
Already now, drones are widely used in police duties, and their use will be widespread and increasing in the future.
That's how I dare to say it, says Himberg.
In addition to finding the missing, the police say Himberg can use drones, for example, in an accident or crime scene investigation and in certain intelligence tasks.
For example, we have to go a little further to check a region where there is a potential fear that there will be violence.
Drone can be used for preliminary investigations.
Karjalan Rugby rises to the 1st Divarium
Karjalan Rugby celebrated the victory of the 2nd Division in Kuopio on Saturday.
The Joensulians were still in the middle of the game in a 7-12 loss for the Helsinki Rugby Club, but found the runners-up in the second period and beat the guests of the South 26-12.
At the same time, the 2-division championship achieved a historic rise for Karjala Rugby in its 1-division.
In the past, the team has played in the first, but at that time the Finnish rugby league was divided into two levels, the SM series and its multi-stakeholder 1-division.
The band is going to take on the show, but it will know quite a lot of work next winter.
The current roster of less than twenty players must be raised to 25.
The 1st Division also knows the increase in the number of games and longer game trips, so the fundraising must also be consistent.
My home run starts in Montreal, confirms head coach
Montreal Canadiens head coach Claude Julien, who plays in the NHL, confirmed on Twitter that Finnish striker Jesperi Kotkaniemi will start the season in Montreal.
Montreal booked the Super Bowl of Kotkaniemen, 18, in the first round with the number three summer reservations.
The attacker joined Montreal's training strength in late summer and has made strong strides in the September training games.
My husband was able to make a goal in his first training game.
Head coach Julien said that the Finn had taken major steps in the development after arriving at the camp.
The NHL body series starts next week on Thursday night against Finnish time.
Montreal will face the Toronto Maple Leafs in the opening round.
What is a good leader?
There has been a lot of talk about leadership this week in Finland.
Nokia’s government chairman, Risto Siilasmaa, told HS in an interview about his book Paranoid Optimist, in which he highlights his leadership philosophy.
At the same time, he criticizes the leadership of his predecessor Jorma Ollila.
Ollila strongly contested the allegations, but previous Nokia clarifications have also mentioned the inability of managers to act as a team; the fear and indifference that in part caused the collapse of the mobile business.
The company’s increased risk capability and agility disappeared.
This week, the Nordic Business Forum was organized in Helsinki, which drew the cream of Finnish business to the Messukeskus.
In addition to Barack Obama, Laval won 12 business stars.
Talking about good leadership was enough.
Leaders legend Gary Hamel said that a good leader should dare to take the company into the future, even when the company is doing well.
The problem is that the decisions are made by those who are mentally most connected to past decisions.
John Mackey, founder of the Whole Foods retail chain, said that the manager should know the message to the entire staff for the purpose of the company.
And that purpose can’t be just to make a profit for the owners.
Susan Cain, the author of the book of success introverts, said that the most successful directors are researched humble.
They act calmly, quietly and decisively.
They are often introverts.
Aswath Damodaran, professor of finance, reminded that the qualities of a good leader must work together with the stage of the company’s lifecycle.
At the beginning of the company, a manager must be able to tell a story on which the future of the company is based.
A mature company needs a leader who knows the numbers.
These lessons at the Nordic Business Forum were listened to by 7,500 visitors - mainly Finnish leaders.
They were in danger of having information.
A good leader is required a lot.
That’s why leadership often goes wrong, even at the highest level.
There were also Siilasmaa and Ollila.
They talked to each other in the hallways.
However, they hardly wondered if they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.
And their humility was not externally easy to assess.
Sara Chafak arrived on a magnificent red carpet right from Los Angeles - spending most of her year abroad
Model Sara Chafak arrived in the Mississippi Finals in a beautiful black suit.
The 2012 Miss Finnish outfit also featured a small stripe.
A little jet lag.
I came back from Los Angeles.
I spend most of my time there, Chafak says.
Chafak says he's going to Los Angeles for experiments.
Among other things, he has made advertisements.
Working in the United States, he describes it as interesting, and also similar to Finland.
However, according to him, the work needs to be done even harder, because the model can easily be found as a replacement for the work.
“We need to be more aggressive and aggressive,” Chafak said.
Choreographer Sonya Lindfors receives 30,000 euros live art award in Kuopio
Artist Sonya Lindfors won a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30,000 cultural award in Kuopio on Saturday.
The winner of the Anti Festival International Prize for Live Art, Lindfors works on choreography, community activism and teaching.
The art of Sonya Lindfors is vital to her surroundings.
His work gives others the opportunity to work and create spaces for dialogue in environments in which they have previously lacked, the board described the winner.
In addition to Finnish Lindfors, a number of international artists were nominated for the award.
The prize is awarded annually to an exceptionally strong artist or group in the field of live art.
Danish police found a Volvo searched during a major operation: "We can't tell you what"
The extensive search by the Danish police has yielded results.
At the beginning of the operation, traffic was closed at the time at the Jewish Quarter and Ison-Belt.
All land and ferry traffic from the island of Sjallan were closed to Sweden, Germany and elsewhere in Denmark.
Police are looking for a black Volvo V90 registered in Sweden.
ISIS reached out to the Copenhague Police Media Center.
The car you are looking for has been found.
We cannot yet tell where the car was found, Henrik Storm tells Evening-Sanom about the Copenhague police briefing.
According to Storm, the black Volvo he was looking for has no direct contact with the police.
According to him, the greatest danger is over.
Danish Ekstra Bladet told police on Saturday about the news event.
Investigation director J<0xC3><0xB8>rgen Bergen Skov was on the run of the silent operation.
He didn't want to tell me what kind of criminal record the case was being investigated.
However, Skov said it was a “serious crime.”
It was a threat to the lives of people.
Three people have been searched for the operation.
Police don't tell me if they've already been arrested.
According to the newspaper, the restrictions on ferry traffic have been lifted.
Copenhague police also followed the events on their Twitter account.
However, according to the police, the general public no longer has any reason to worry, as the threat was directed against certain people.
Macedonia's name has caused decades of disagreement - now the people vote on it in controversial elections
The new name of the country is currently being voted on in the Balkans.
Under the Agreement between the Governments of Macedonia and Greece, the name should be the Republic of North Macedonia.
So far, Greece has blocked Macedonia’s attempts to become a member of NATO and the EU with its veto law.
According to Greece, the name Macedonia belongs to its northern province.
The referendum does not mention a new name, but asks whether the voters in Macedonia are in favour of EU-NATO membership by adopting the agreement.
The vote began online at least at a school in the centre of Skopje.
A retired nurse at the school, Olivera Argirosvka, hoped to support the agreement.
Referendum means change if it opens the door to Europe and NATO.
This is a change, especially for young people, he said.
In 1991, the name of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was used in official contexts.
The government of Prime Minister Zoran Zaev has campaigned for the approval of the agreement.
The nationalist right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has again called for a boycott of the referendum.
In addition to the result, it is exciting to see whether voting delays exceed the required 50%.
The referendum is not binding, but a victory by yes would allow the mandate to change the constitution.
The constitutional amendment requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The Greek Parliament has also yet to approve the agreement.
Voting places will be closed at 8:00 p.m. in Finland.
What a win!
Robert Helenius Erkan Teperin
Robert Helenius met late Saturday night at Erkan Teper's heavyweight series in Germany.
A 34-year-old Finn took a shot at his 36-year-old German opponent in Waldenbuch, Stuttgart.
The main game of the night was the Intercontinental heavyweight series of the IBF.
Its winner may be given the opportunity to take on the harder tasks seen on Saturday, with considerable economic importance.
Helenius solved the match in the eighth round, smashing Teper with his hard left hand.
Teper couldn't get up from the floor anymore.
"Nordic Nightmare" wounded his opponent for the third time, when the German's nose began to shed blood.
Helenius and Teper met in the circle for the first time.
They were supposed to take place in December 2015.
Then Teper appealed for injury and resigned.
After that, it turned out that the German had been doped twice in a doping test.
Helenius has taken his name from his professional career in 28 games and suffered two losses.
As a clear favorite, Teper has won 19 professional matches in his career and lost three times.
Hamilton's winning order - Difference to Vetteli already 50 points
The Formula One championship was once again closer to reassurance, as Mercedeksen Lewis Hamilton won the Russian gp and extended his World Cup scoring lead to Ferrari Sebastian Vettel to 50 points (306-256).
There are still five games left.
Valtteri Bottas, who left the racetrack, drove second.
Bottas, who won his opening career in Sochi last year, had the top spot for midfielders, but Mercedes told Bottas to pass Hamilton.
Vettel drove third, Ferrari's Kimi Räikkönen fourth.
Red Bull's Max Verstappen was fifth.
Two malicious men in Joensuu were trapped a block away
Two men were bullied and beaten by a 31-year-old hairdresser in Joensuu at Silkatu 12 on Saturday after 6 p.m.
According to police, the men also picked up the victim’s phone.
Police reached the suspects, a 35-year-old man in July and a 39-year-old man in Yomantsi, shortly after the incident.
They were arrested on suspicion of robbery, police said.
The victim suffered from caries that did not require a visit to the doctor.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk is resigning as chairman of the company’s board.
Musk has agreed with the U.S. authorities.
At the same time, Musk was fined <0x24>20 million for tweeting that he had secured funds to pull Tesla out of the stock exchange.
The U.S. Securities Commission (SEC) has accused Muski of securities fraud.
Musk will continue as CEO of Tesla, but the company will also have to pay a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 million if the agreement between the authorities and Muski is confirmed by law.
Canada fights against time to reach a deal on oil with the United States
Time threatens to end the Oil Free Trade Agreement in the negotiations between the United States and Canada.
The U.S. has set a backstage on Sunday, and the country’s negotiators have discussed closely over the weekend.
Canada's chief negotiator, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, postponed his speech at the UN General Assembly in order to focus fully on trade negotiations.
At the request of President Donald Trump, the United States, Canada and Mexico began negotiations about a year ago to renew the North American Free Trade Agreement.
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States reached an agreement with each other, but no agreement with Canada has yet been reached.
The U.S. and Mexico want to bring the deal into force before Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who won the Mexican presidential election, takes office in early December.
Trump has said that Canada’s involvement in the agreement is not necessary.
He has previously informed Congress that plans to sign the deal at the end of November - whether Canada is involved or not.
Due to these schedules, the text of the US-Canada agreement should be ready by Sunday, so that the US Congress has enough time to assess it.
Neighbor thought the candles were lit as fire in Kaakkur - fire alarmed on site
The fired candles in the apartment in Oulu, Kaakkur, caused a fire alarm on Sunday night.
A dozen units of the rescue facility were alerted on the spot due to a possible floor stall.
On the spot it became clear that the candles burned in the sauna of the living room had appeared to the opposite house from a fire, so it was reported to the emergency centre.
There was no fire at the site.
Police arrested 11 people after the Honka-HJK match - raids on the field and at the metro station
Police arrested 11 people after the Honka-HJK men's football league in Espoo on Saturday, the West New Zealand Police Commissioner Teemu Värtinen confirmed to the STT.
The grounds for this were to protect against crime and interference.
The arrests were released after the situation had calmed, Värtinen said.
It was previously reported by the Night-Sanomat.
The match ended 0-0.
After the final afternoon, a large group of spectators ran into the field from the viewing room reserved for HJK supporters.
The situation led to stunts and clashes between the supporters of the teams.
To end the situation, it was necessary, among other things, to have riding police officers.
In addition to the field, raids took place in the area of the nearby metro station, where some of the arrests took place.
I wasn’t there, but from what I saw in the pictures, the situation was unpleasant, Värtinen referred to the crackling that took place on the field.
According to the report, no criminal reports have been made as a result of the incident.
Table rock surprised the butterfly in his time at the SE World Cup, Laukkanen also swims in the final
Jenna Laukkanen and Riku Pöytäkvi have advanced to the finals on the final day of the 3/7 World Swimming Cup in the Netherlands.
Swimming in Eindhoven on a short route.
HSS’s table rock surprised Finland with its record of 50 metres in butterflying, where he was second among the Alkers at the time 22.82.
Earlier in September, Pöytäkvi swims in Helsinki for SE travel time 22.77.
Ari-Pekka Liukkonen, who represented Espola Cetu, was 24.68 at the time of butterflying.
Swimming Club Vuokatin Laukkanen was at the start of the 50-metre tie at the sixth time 30.48 and advanced to the final.
At the start of the two-hundred-meter mixing, Laukkanen had a time of 2.14,25 at 15.
Students showcase a rare delight: an ancient tragedy - a simplified Oresthesia influenced by its visual model
Ancient tragedies are rarely tasted in Finnish scenes.
For example, the last tragedy of antiquity was seen in the National Theatre, the Sophocles Filoktetes, in 1988.
Now the School of Theatre brought the only surviving theatrical trilogy of antiquity, Aiskhyloksen Orestesia, to the tour beginning with the National Theatre.
Starting in 2015, the project Laws open! involves students working together with a professional director internationally.
Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin, is the director of this fourth project, as well as the first one.
In April, Oresteia received her international first night in Berlin.
Roiha’s agreement on Oresteia summarizes the story of the end of the Atreus family’s bloodshed and the birth of the rule of law in earnest to twenty minutes, especially by tightening choir parts.
The work manages to be very faithful to the spirit of the fine Finnish version of Kirsti Simonsuru (2003).
Dramatic lights and a revealing performance on the theater’s sides emphasise simplified and bright stage thinking.
At its center is the dynamics between the choir's performers, who turn away from the choir, and the choir's performance.
The presentation uses both dual and triple nominations for nominal roles.
The actors did not leave the stage at all, so, for example, the murders of Agamemnon and Kassandra returning from the Trojan War are also shown on the stage, unlike in ancient performance traditions.
Of course, the presentation does not emphasize that it is faithful to the ancient tradition of the presentation.
Rather, a modern, faithful interpretation of the text is created before the eyes of the viewer, which is constantly aware of its ritual roots.
Roiha has managed to bring out the master stage of the student actors as a close group, directly as one organism, a rhythmic group.
Especially in the choir sections, actors who lean heavily into very expressive, sculptural group formations can gain access to their rights on a blank, only by decorating the white front porch, with the stage.
Impressive.
Oresthesia’s performance tour continues to Kouvola and Oulu Theatre.
Korean manufacturer manufactures its first hydrogen charger
The innovation is beginning to emerge in Europe, especially thanks to the cooperation agreement with Hyindai and Swiss H2 Energy.
According to the cooperation agreement published at the IAA Motor Show in Hannover, Hyundai will deliver a new model of a thousand cars for the Swiss company and its partners.
By introducing a fuel-fuel truck to the market, Hyundai will continue to refer to the Nexon and ix35/Tucson Fuel Cell models on the road as a hydrogen vehicle manufacturer.
With this world’s first project of its kind, we are taking fuel technology even further.
We are also continuously looking for opportunities to expand the market area of these vehicles, for example by monitoring the development of the tanker network, Hyundai Motor Deputy Chief Executive In Cheol Lee said in a statement.
Nyrki ripped several times in Kajaan
A little over thirty-something man abused three men at a restaurant in the centre of Kajaan and in front of it on Saturday morning.
The man first hit a man inside the restaurant, as a result of which he was removed from the place.
Outside, he would drag another man to the ground, and in the absence of the third man, the aggressor also struck him.
The police arrested the perpetrator.
At the police station, the man continued to behave aggressively and kicked another policeman in the foot.
The man also threatened the police with abuse and murder.
The man was taken to the tube to calm down.
The case is being investigated in three cases of abuse and in violent opposition to the official.
In the centre of Kajaan, another incident of maltreatment occurred in Välikadu on Saturday morning.
The victim was abused by two men.
At first, a 20-year-old Canaanite was killed.
A little later, another man threw her to the ground, and the man who had previously beaten the victim was still kicked.
The outsiders pulled the perpetrators away from the victim and called the police.
However, the perpetrators were able to leave before the police arrived.
The police will ask the eyewitnesses to contact the Kajaan police at 0295 416 520 or by e-mail to studienta.kainuu<0x40>polisi.fi.
Long-line radio broadcaster Erkki Pälli has died
As a long-term journalist, Erkki Pälli died of cancer at the age of 83.
Radio broadcaster Erkki Pälli, 83, has died.
He died of unhealed liver cancer, which he reported on his Facebook page in March 2018.
Yes, this is going on.
The doctor has said that, I live day after day, he commented on his condition to Iitalehde a month ago.
The safety of aunts and aunts must be ensured
I was hired for the first time in 1984.
When a topic in these years rings surprises me, it’s usually a big news.
When I wrote (Karjalainen, 27.9.) about the insecurity of retail workers, I was surprised and even a little bit angry.
I also spoke about the issue by Erika Kähärä, expert on the work environment of the Trade Union of the Services Sectors (PAM).
He says the criminal records don't tell you the real situation.
The problem is growing, although employers, of course, say otherwise.
The police are only aware of cases that have been clearly proven serious and many of the real cases of violence remain unreported.
"Of course, companies have the obligation to keep close statistics on their workplace safety status under the Occupational Safety Act, but these statistics remain for internal use and do not collect their data anywhere," he said.
Mental injuries don't end in statistics.
In cases of violence, there has always been a problem that they do not always cause physical injuries.
Psychic traumas can still be much more serious than bruises and wounds.
The difference between a situation of violence and a situation of threatening violence is difficult to draw, when even a certain level of aggressive threat is to be counted as violence - even if there is no hand in hand.
Too many people are afraid in their workplace, even if the actual action does not happen.
Some residential areas are restless.
The store has acquired guards.
With the opening hours of the stores being released, the vaping in the media was also quite large due to its impact on the security of the vendors.
"At that time, many employers arranged guard services for at least nighttime hours and to stop working alone," Kähähä commented.
When nothing happens, we make the wrong conclusion.
This would seem to have had an effective effect now, but this produces a new negative trend.
When, because of guarding, the disturbances remained well-maintained, there was a sense that guarding would be unnecessary.
Now, in many places, we are trying to find solutions that could eliminate costly guardian services.
Slight abuse is a criminal offence, and it is quite understandable that the seller who has been abused does not want to make an investigation request from a criminal who usually lives near the store.
But the same, according to the 2011 law, mild abuse will become subject to the prosecutor if it occurs in the workplace.
I think we need pre-trial cases now.
The next time an aunt shops or an uncle is abused, the police should investigate and accuse the prosecutor.
If the court injected a few malicious persons into prison and sentenced them there for severe punishment, the practice would be cleaned up.
In a society where even small businesses need to be open around the clock, the safety of their employees must be ensured.
Heidi Sohlberg congratulated the mission before the start of the live broadcast - "Sara, Iiro is then married"
This year’s Miss’s crown will not be seen in the traditional way on TV, but will be shown on the Viafree website.
The broadcast will be hosted by former Miss Finland Heidi Sohlberg and Viasat and Viaplay NHL and KHL studios Iiro Harjula.
Janni Hussi is the director of the backstage and the red carpet.
Prior to the direct broadcast, the speaker told the invited visitors and media representatives of the course of the broadcast.
In the beginning, Sohlberg asked the public to give Harjula sharp applause.
Now all the women whisper!
Now look at this of our male performer, Sohlberg shimmered his colleague in the audience hurricane.
The leading competitions are followed by Miss Finland in many previous years.
Among other things, Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi sat next to each other and Sohlberg threw a little joke in either direction.
Sara, Iiro is married!
Sohlberg glanced at the hills.
Most likely, Sohlberg pointed to the divorce Siepp, who laughed at the comment, although initially seemed confused.
Sieppi first spoke of his resignation in the Weekend of the Evening Words magazine.
The Mississippi woman said she didn’t want to make a difference more public because it’s a matter between her and Roope Salmis.
He said he is not in a hurry for a new relationship, but he intends to focus on himself.
I focus on my own things and especially my own life, Sara Sieppi told me.
Harjula’s marriage status emerged even later when Sohlberg accidentally mistakenly called Janni Huss and Iiro Harjula as a couple.
The three of them laughed ridiculously.
Iirohan was married or how did it go?
Janni Huss made a joke.
Northern man tortured his left-handed man by frying, burning and feeding a strong sauce
The county court has sentenced a 34-year-old man in Kokkola to three years in prison for numerous crimes against his left-handed man.
The crime was, among other things, a belt, cable and ties.
The court ruled these items to be lost to the state.
Rankin's case was about a suspected brutal rape.
However, the District Court rejected this claim.
The cause of the coco player included four abuses, brutal abuse, coercion, illegal threats, freedom resistance, brutal freedom resistance and two injuries.
The crimes occurred between March 26th and May 24th last year.
At the end of the last act, the man was arrested and imprisoned a few days later.
On Thursday, the district court of Pohjanmaa issued a verdict and ordered the 34-year-old to remain in Vaasa prison.
No evidence of rape.
The 34-year-old was also charged with two violent violations of liberty and a brutal rape on 22 May.
However, these allegations were rejected by the court as unproven.
The case was dealt with behind closed doors in court.
However, the District Judge gave a public account of the verdict.
According to the District Judge, the defendant had targeted his wife for violence, threats and coercion in situations where this had been linked.
The accused stabbed the victim with a knife, smoked a tobacco, fed a strong sauce and poured water and coffee on it.
The court sentenced the state to lose the means of crime: belt and cable, ties, bathrobe belt, knife and zipper.
The Four Witnesses
According to the district court, the parties continued to live together between the acts.
It can be read from the verdict that a large part of the most vicious acts took place at the end of the period of the crime.
The court heard four witnesses, two women and two men.
The 34-year-old must pay compensation for pain, fracture, suffering and temporary damage of a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5,800.
He hardly has that money, because the convict is already collecting his old debts.
Prison is not a man's first.
The evening newspaper does not tell the convict's name to protect the victim's privacy.
A recent county court ruling is not legal when writing this.
Europe in four-point lead for the Ryder Cup
European golf professionals captured their lead on Saturday in a traditional slot game against the United States.
Europe will lead the Ryder Cup, which will be played at the Paris Liaison, with a score of 10-6, while the 12 doubles are still ahead on Sunday.
Europe won three of the four four four-ball matches that started on Saturday, and in the afternoon's four-game wins were set 2-2.
The European leaders were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four matches they played on Friday and Saturday.
In the past, there were no European couples.
On Sunday, the couple will look for more history.
No European player has ever won five points together in the Ryder Cup, and no American has ever made it to the top three: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
HJK condemns his supporters' ravenous interference in Honka match: "Violence does not belong to football"
On Sunday, the football squad HJK released a press release condemning the disruption of its supporters in the four-day FC Honka match in Tapiola.
"We regret the events following the Honka-HJK match on behalf of our supporters," the statement said.
At the end of the game, about 50 HJK supporters ran into the field, and part appeared to be trying to challenge Hong Kong supporters.
There was also a struggle between the supporters.
The organizers were not able to calm the situation, but police and horsemen were needed on the spot.
The HJK said in its announcement that the team’s players and staff were shocked by what happened.
Events after the match are not consistent with the values of our 111-year-old follower.
"We strongly dismiss all activities that threaten the security of the events," the statement said.
The HJK pledges to assist the authorities and the organizers of the event in identifying security-threatening factors and eliminating mild air phenomena.
Supporting culture is a part of football and an important thing for HJK.
We support in every way possible positive, cheerful and encouraging activities in football clubs.
“Violence is not part of it,” the report said.
Filipino inventor flies in drone car - this is how to avoid traffic cravings
Mendiola is a Filipino inventor, hip-hop dancer and some kind of Pelle Peloton.
He now belongs to a growing group in the world that swears he invented a flying car – or at least his own version of it.
As a competitor, he has factors such as Audi and Airbus.
Mendiola, however, does not believe in mass production of its equipment.
According to world-renowned reports, a man has spent much of his property building his dream.
He started developing his flying car six years ago.
Now he calls the development version a drone car.
Recently, he says he made his first successful test -- he flew on his device at a height of over seven meters.
One of his goals was to avoid traffic jams.
I hope the device will inspire positive reactions.
This was only a dream five years ago, Mendiola said in the British Daily Mail.
JHL predicts: Work struggles beginning tomorrow will be visible in children's day care and social and health services
The bans on overwork and mountaineering that start tomorrow in public and welfare sectors are particularly visible in social and health services as well as in child care, says Päivi Niemi-Laine, JHL President.
The effects will be extensive, and they will certainly be visible in a way that does not have enough staff in place.
Everyone has to think about how to find their child.
The job of the employer is now to make sure that the services are playing and that no one's life is threatened," Niemi-Laine told STT.
According to Niemi-Lainee, there was also a shortage of workers at the beginning of the year when JHL members were in overworking and mountaineering bans because of contract negotiations.
Employers have made it possible, through the flexibility, not to hire staff, but to overwork or to change turnovers.
This is not yet a labor-fighting operation.
In terms of occupational safety, it is normal for every employee to take care of their regular hours of work and only do them.
JHL opposes the government’s intentions to ease the protection of small businesses’ dismissal.
Municipal Employers Labour Market Director Markku Jalonen will not begin to pre-evaluate the impact of overwork and mountaineering bans.
However, he does not believe that they are very revolutionary, although services may be weakened.
Employers across Finland are aware of this and have made preparations for what is to be done.
The area is so vast, social, health and technical sector that it is difficult to say.
The impacts can vary greatly by industry, region and employers, Jalonen told STT.
Jalonen says that last week we had already gained experience, among other things, from the Super and Primary Nursing Association and the Social and Health Professionals' Association Tehyn, which lasted three days.
Their effects were relatively small.
The JHL overwork and mountaineering ban applies to employees in the municipalities, churches, the state and the private social and health sectors, among others.
For example, family day care providers are limited outside.
At this stage, the labour struggle affects almost 100,000 members of the JHL.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL’s actions may take a long time.
The Alliance has also prepared for other labour-fighting activities if the preparation of the lay-off law continues.
The government should now admit that they are running against the wall and hard.
I believe that both the ay-movement and the government must be opposed.
It is strange that the hard ones are already in the pipe, even though the show has not yet been given, Jalonen updates.
The Great Coral Rift is born with the strength of children and adults - in the fitness circles of the performance the students will study the virtues of the raven and the seahorse
In other premises, the Great Coral Reef Collective received its first evening in Hamburg last spring and last Saturday it was presented for the second time in Finland, this time at Kanneltalo.
Like the previous works of the group, the Great Coral Cross is a work that is built from the beginning to the end with the audience.
This time, however, a clearer presentation will also be constructed, which revitalizes and crystallises the findings made in the initial exercises.
There is also plenty of magic in the theatre for children.
The child’s perspective has already been included in the preparation phase of the work.
The Great Coral Cross is not a children’s show, but a show that adults and children do in cooperation.
It provides adults with information and observations on how children receive information and make art.
The ability of children to engage in exercises and plays together also diminishes the distance between adults and children.
The Great Coral Circle is somewhat reminiscent of saturation ballet, fitness circles and nature topics, but finally it is transformed into a different, non-human environment around the visits.
The Great Coral Reef begins with the exploration of coral and coral reef-living organisms and fish movements.
In six different gymnasiums, you will learn, among other things, the skills of a raven and a seahorse.
Finally, an hour-long performance in which music, lights, and brilliant paintings and outfits help you get to know the life of the coral reef.
In the Great Coral Reef there are both dive people who observe the life of the coral reef and the corals that are being observed.
There are also coral-viewing organisms.
The sights and observations pointed in many directions make the performance dense and life-stirring.
Whether it's a landscape of an organism, an organism looking at the organism, and another organism looking at the organism or the organism - and all this at the same time.
It doesn’t seem difficult for children.
In other spaces, the group seeks to practice on the limits of thinking and action, which it is challenging to tackle when the group is made up of both children and adults.
On the other hand, the involvement of children makes it more important.
After the workshop, the Citrator will host a silent demonstration for the threatened corals.
Destroyers beyond human understanding should not be hardened, even though it may be difficult to understand the importance of exercising compassion in front of the destroyers.
In other premises, he has built his work in such a way that it respects the diversity of life, even with a political outlook.
There are other generations, there are different types of consciousness, other species, and their future generations, whose wonder and play it raves space.
Children grow up too fast - I'm happy that in my childhood there were no smartphones
Nowadays, children and young people are becoming more irresponsible.
Young people begin to smoke and drink as they are younger and younger all the time.
In my opinion, children should be children throughout their childhood, and not get involved in their lives because of sexual intercourse, because others say they do.
I was horrified when my friend told me that she had to pick up her fifth-grade sister at the end of the weekend from an "entertainer."
When he came to pick up his drunk sister, she told me about her sex experiences that night.
I couldn’t imagine my own sister in the same situation because we’ve been told and warned throughout our childhood that we shouldn’t have sex and that sex is an adult matter.
I hope that today’s children will be able to live a decent childhood and not have to grow up too early because of the group pressure created by their friends.
I constantly see younger girls on Instagram wearing makeup in their pictures and revealing their clothes on them.
Snapchat is used to take and send images that reveal in the evening.
It’s harder for girls to guess what age they are.
Modern 13-year-olds can easily look like 18-year-olds and older ones.
My childhood consisted of playing in the woods and playing board games.
I’m glad I didn’t have smartphones in my childhood.
I had been a child for many years, and I didn’t have to think about what others thought of me.
Previous: Authorities told the head of state that the case of Airiston Helmet is not related to national security
According to Ilkka Kanerva interviewed earlier this week, the Defence Police and the Defence Forces went to inform the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committee.
The Finnish leader has been told that the investigation of Airiston Helmet is currently not related to national security, but to organized crime, Yle reported.
Information from anonymous sources was confirmed by Ilkka Kanerva (cook), Chairman of the Ylelle Defence Committee.
According to Kanerva, the Defence Forces and the Defence Police went to the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committee this week to report on the ongoing investigation.
This is primarily seen as economic crime.
They were quite strict about not speculating that there was anything else in this, Kanerva commented in Ylen’s interview.
According to the above information, there has been no evidence to date of a connection to national security of the material seized, but the investigation is only in its territory.
We cannot yet know what can be revealed from it, says one of Yle’s interviewees.
A week ago, large domestic exports on the island of Turu and on the mainland have raised the question of whether the investigation is a mere economic crime or a threat to Finland’s internal security.
Earlier this week, the evening hosted a case in which statements were made both for and against.
Video: A dreamless picture saved a series of Liverpool losers
Liverpool's 100% start to the Champions League was completed, but it was still a more satisfying team to play 1-1 at Stamford Bridge.
Sunday marks a year since Manchester City reached Stamford Bridge and escaped a 1-0 visitor victory.
Then Pep Guardiola's combination sent a signal to the entire League of Nations that City was now serious.
Everyone remembers how the last season ended.
And certainly Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp arrived at the same ideal West London.
The Reds had started the Champions League with six consecutive wins.
Liverpool started stronger, and especially Virgil van Dijk felt dominant after finishing his own field.
Chelsea, for their part, had a great cup win from Anfield Road on Wednesday.
Then Eden Hazard rose from the exchange bank to solve the match with a stunning individual performance.
Now, of course, Hazard was present right from the beginning.
In the 25th minute, he first played in a small space with Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho.
Eventually, the Croatian saw Hazard falling forward and sent him a fully weighted pass.
Hazard went a little farther down the penalty area, but there he bombed a completely left leg bet at the back.
Polo's Brass guard Alisson was a little slow in his fight and didn't get his fingers on the ball.
Klopp must have felt the position of losing was slightly unfair, as almost immediately after Antonio Rüdiger fell from Mo Salah’s command line.
In the second season, Chelsea wicket-keeper Kepa also made real appearances.
The bass guard quickly reacted to Sadio Mané’s draw and pushed the ball from the root of the pole to the corner.
At the other end, Alisson dropped to zero through Hazard.
The best of the guests came in the 72nd minute when James Milner found Bobby Firmino.
However, the Brass Star bust was directed by teammate David Luizia, who saved the hosts’ leadership.
It didn’t last until the 89th minute, when alternate Daniel Sturridge was free to shoot at 25 meters.
Sturridge played at his old home stadium, and the attacker bombed it in honor of the irresistible bet at the top.
Liverpool's 100 percent league start ended with a 1-1 draw, but it's still in the league - together with Manchester City.
Chelsea are also closely involved in the championship two points behind the top.
In the Clock Transfer Discussion, the potters are deep
I remember a decade ago when a newspaper asked different Finnish influencers what divided the Finnish people.
Juice Widow's answer was the only one left in mind: the Nen-destiny.
Some have a nose-head and some don’t.
You can be born anywhere, and here's one offer.
Finland has made it possible for the EU to give up its annual clock transfer.
There are many who agree that the transfer of clocks twice a year has been a work of fools and has caused a variety of problems.
In the end, this achievement seems to be at least the easiest stage of the solution in Finland, although it has never been easy.
The hardest thing now is to decide what time it will finally end up in: the current summer or winter time or some other time zone.
This can also be said by people on the otakanta.fi page.
The questionnaire was opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and will be open on Friday, October 12.
The discussion is intensely held at coffee tables and on social media, and everyone has a word to say.
The defenders of winter time base their position on the effect of morning light on human well-being and the defenders of summer time on the effect of night light on the outdoors and thus on the well-being of people.
Both positions have strong supporters and good reasoning.
Research has shown that morning light rhythms a person’s day and gives him energy.
On the other hand, if you don’t particularly suffer from a dark awakening, it will increase the brightness of people’s movements outside and give better opportunities for, for example, autumn gardening.
The amount of additional light after a normal working day has already been calculated by hour.
I'd love to take both, but our bad location in the North Pole of the Earth, we can't do anything.
Winters are too dark and summers are too bright for many anyway.
A typical debate on the subject is that one's own view is taken and one's view is very strongly opposed.
The reasoning of the other party is not to be heard, because the most important thing is how it feels itself.
Since almost everyone has an opinion on it, it is quite useless to try to turn the other’s mind.
It's a waste of money.
The subject is terribly easy to argue, because it does not require a great deal of effort and there is enough mutual feeling to justify it.
On the other hand, similar issues are usually debated more sharply and equally fruitlessly.
It would be a pity if the wrong option was chosen, but it wouldn’t be appropriate.
And it always offers a suitable singapore, if life feels like an apple.
Josba battled the Horseman's Victim
Josba's first guest game in the Saliband Divar produced three full series points against Nurmon Jymy.
Josba went home from Wall Street with a happy 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) win.
Nurmo was still leading at the start of the third battalion, but Josba sought out compositions and recycled men in chains.
During 50.47, the brothers Etu and Juuso Lehtinieni scored a 6-5 win.
In the ice hoops of both teams, decisive minutes were played on equal footing.
The most effective was Juuso Lehtinienim (2<0x2B>1).
The second series was fire-resistant, however, when Teemu Tukhne (1<0x2B>1), Jere Kaartinen (1<0x2B>0) and Jere Kettunen (1<0x2B>0) also hit.
Miika Kosonenkin (1<0x2B>0) also played in the second row at the time of her birth.
Josball has six points after three series rounds.
The next one will be O2-Jyväskylä in two weeks.
200th Anniversary at Enon Church on Sunday
The 200th Anniversary of the Eno Church will be celebrated on Sunday, partly in a very sad atmosphere.
A week ago, the burning of a church in danger of acceleration was a shock.
The church of Eno was also guarded for two nights after the fire.
Despite the pain, today is still a place for celebration.
Although no one would like to, the Church of Eno is now the oldest church in the congregation of Joensuu.
The church on the mountain in the middle of the village has always been the heart of Eno despite all the municipal and other associations of the world.
The family reunion begins at Eno Church today at 10 a.m.
Afterwards, we move to the church hall next to the peasant table.
There are all kinds of programs throughout the day, both indoors and outdoors.
For example, you can visit the church building with the help of Ari Räsäsen, who has been a retired mayor for 37 years.
The Church’s Birthday Celebration also marks the end of one era.
Already decommissioned, the church cathedral, built in 1982, will keep its doors open today for the last time.
Now we are in the avoidance rooms of the former municipality, says Capt. Markku Koistinen.
The church cathedral was destroyed by internal air problems, but the church has been standing healthy for those 200 years.
Elon Musk rejects Tesla government spokesman’s position – <0x24>40 million in fraud charges agreed
Tesla electric car manufacturer and CEO Elon Musk have agreed to a legal agreement with the U.S. Securities Supervisory Authority (SEC).
The SEC suspected Musk was guilty of securities fraud, and Musk was in danger of being dismembered by the company he founded.
Musk will continue as CEO of Tesla.
Instead, Musk will have to resign from Tesla’s presidency for three years.
The company will have to hire an outside board chairman.
Musk is also under stricter control.
According to the agreement, Tesla will have to hire two independent leaders and monitor Muski’s communications more closely in the future.
In addition, Tesla and Musk are both paying <0x24>20 million (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>17 million) to settle the case.
“The decision is intended to prevent new market disturbances and harm to Tesla’s shareholders,” said Steven Peik, CEO of SEC.
The case began in August when Musk wrote on Twitter that he might pull the company out of the stock exchange.
Musk also said that the company's finances were secured.
The tweet momentarily raised Tesla's stock price.
The SEC suspected Musk was guilty of securities fraud.
According to the agency, the tweet was false and misleading, and Musk had not spoken about the arrangement with any other management of the company or potential funders.
In practice, the agency blamed Muskia for misleading investors.
On Friday, the SEC announced its challenge to the company and Musk.
The SEC said it was demanding that Musk be fined and banned from running stock exchanges.
The challenge of the SEC was stalled by investors, and Tesla’s shares went down sharply.
More than 800 people killed in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami
The death toll in Indonesia's earthquake and subsequent tsunami has risen to at least 832, according to the country's disaster agency AFP.
The number of deaths is still expected to increase, as destruction is in the meantime.
According to Vice-President Yusuf Kalla, the final figure could rise to thousands.
Friday's earthquake triggered a tsunami that struck the town of Palu on the island of Sulawesi.
After the tsunami, a warning was issued, but it was quickly cancelled.
According to the authorities, almost all of the dead known to date are from Palus.
Rescue authorities are concerned, among other things, about the region of Donggala, near the centre of the quake, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Many people already know that they are dead.
Aid requests for iron ore
The Indonesian army has been alerted to help rescue workers in search of victims.
President Joko Widod, who arrived in the area today, called on the soldiers to continue their rescue work day and night.
One of the centerpieces of the rescue work is the hotel in Palu, where 50-60 people are still believed to be in ruins.
Mohammed Syaugi, head of the rescue agency, said one of the ruins of Roa-Roa, a popular hotel for business travelers, had been found missing at night.
We also heard people's requests for help, he said.
According to Syaug, the earthquake and tsunami area would be rapidly depleted with heavy raging equipment.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find their missing relatives.
Help, you in Palu and nearby.
My friend’s family members are still missing, one writer appealed to the Facebook group.
Politicians' phone numbers leaked into the hands of rioters in Britain
Many British politicians were being harassed when their contact information leaked due to deficiencies in the encryption of the app.
The disturbances reached the ministers’ telephone numbers, among others.
This was an application used by the Conservative Party in the government.
For example, Brexit-driven Minister of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Michael Gove and former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson were being harassed.
Several MEPs received disturbances.
Due to the lack of encryption of the app, the audience was able to access the profiles of politicians who were in the annual CPP mobile app.
The public was able to access the profiles by using the e-mail address of the policy, which was easily accessible online.
The person logging into the profile can view and edit the material stored in the profile.
Someone managed to change Boris Johnson's profile picture for a moment and the title was insulting.
The profile picture of Michael Goven was changed to the image of mediamoglu Rupert Murdoch.
The Guardian columnist Dawn Foster described the problem by writing that the meeting app allows you to sign in to other people’s profiles with these email addresses.
Then login users can view the contact details of the profile person and even send messages on behalf of the person.
The conference app made every journalist, politician and participant’s phone number public, Foster reviewed.
A Conservative Party spokesman apologized for the leak.
He said that technical problems have been solved and the application now operates safely.
The ICO supports the data leak.
The app was developed by the Australian company Crown Comms.
The opposition Labour Party criticises that the Conservative Party cannot be trusted in security matters.
Every week, a large group of Poles are watching The Wall of Finland.
Eye-catching viewers drew attention to the reactions of the studio audience in The Wall Finland.
The fast-spread U.S. format The Wall landed on the Finnish version of Nelos last Saturday.
The game show hosted by Heikki Paasosen is described in Poland in the same studio where other international productions of the format are made.
In the Polish studio, the possibilities for filming were exceptional, as the size of the 12-metre-high format required space from space.
During the initial period, a studio audience of the program was featured on social media, which was translated into Polish.
On Twitter, there was a debate as to whether the Polish people in the studio might understand anything about the Finnish-playing game.
Nelosen’s head of domestic programmes, Unne Ringunen, will explain the matter to Intelhehde.
He says that the studio audience is close to the players, other Finns, foreign Finns living in Poland as well as Polish spectators.
In Finnish production, the audience is composed of international batters, as are the audiences of The Wall episodes depicted in the same production room in other countries.
In Finland, too, there are such gaps, so-called professional audiences, which visit the descriptions of different programs, according to Ringune.
He reminds us that tracking the game in itself is not so difficult, even if you do not understand the language in which it is played.
The red and green balls falling from the wall are easy to distinguish.
However, the guest-language studio has interpreters to handle the translation work.
There are two interpreters who interpret events all the time as a simultaneous interpretation for the studio director.
And the studio director then instructs the audience and tells what kind of leak is being thrown there, for example, and what the situation is going on, Ringunen says.
He compares the situation to how David Hasselhoff and I were recently delivered in domestic production.
A few years ago, David Hasselhoff was involved in Talent Finnish pictures with us in Finland.
He always had a simultaneous interpretation in his ear and he knew everything that was spoken in Finnish in the descriptions, the sum of the Ring.
Japan's southern typhoon breaks down to main island - authorities warn of landslides and floods
The authorities also warn of possible landslides and floods.
At least 50 people have been injured in the typhoon tram, but authorities say major injuries have been avoided and there are no reports of fatalities so far.
On the southern island of Okinawa, the wind has been so strong that it has turned cars around.
According to the NHK public radio company, people have been evacuated to shelters, and electricity has been cut off from more than 300,000 households.
More than a thousand flights have been cancelled, and the cruise ships have been halted due to the storm.
The storm is expected to strike near Osaka at half the time of the day in Finland.
The capital city of Tokyo is not directly on the route of the storm, but there are also promised strong winds and rains.
The trains were cancelled in Tokyo today.
According to meteorologists, Trami will visit Japan until Monday.
The sky of Assisi is still darkening
The beginning of the season has been bad.
The skies were nearly as bad as the team lost to Vaasan Sport at home on Saturday, reading 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1).
The players now have five consecutive losses, and two points from the six rounds in total.
None of the defenders of <0xC3><0x84>ssy or two lower chains have yet to score.
Pressure is also increasing all the time.
The game was played by the public at the time when the game was about half the time.
Six games have just been played, and of course there is no reason to give up.
We have to worry about it, because we played so badly.
Particularly the performance of the second set was shamefully bad, said Jarno Kärki, who made 1<0x2B>2.
The sport, of course, enjoyed it.
The team had a game on Friday, so it would have been thought to be visible.
Maybe he saw it, but the <0xC3><0x84>sät didn't know how to use it.
The number of visitors for the day continued to grow
Today’s mother, Pirkko Hyvärinen, is wondering at the audience at the large hall.
Somehow it was thought that maybe not so many people would come this year, Hyfarinen thinks in the morning.
In the autumn of 2017, the SM competitions were held at the same time as Bääädän, so perhaps it would be expected that the audience could even drop slightly from the previous year.
However, it did not happen; the corridors closed sharply before ten, the sellers told us that the products were finished, the news tree was sold more than before, almost 500 doses, and the number of cars also saw a rise in Hyfarinen.
The estimated number of visitors has been around 6000, Hyvärinen says later in the afternoon.
At five o’clock in the morning and afternoon, there was a great deal of program for children’s families, which seemed to attract them to the record-breaking spot.
In addition, Hyvärinen estimates that the event will reach even further.
Sellers also map to Liper each year from a larger area.
This year, nearly a hundred vendors of rapporteurs, craftsmen, bakers and harvesters had arrived at the bakery.
Mother of the day PIRKKO Hyvärinen loved the audience from the viewpoint of the hall.
At the beginning of the day, the harvest was blessed.
In the children's series Teija Kiviniemen's beautiful bread won the public vote.
There were 11 different forms of bread in the children’s bread competition.
The winner of the squirrel competition, Marjatta Vepsäläinen, spent the day in the marttoes squirrels.
7 x the most beautiful lamp - here you will recognize a good lamp
Wake up the space to life, create the right atmosphere for the interior and read the book with your eyes without being tired.
It's worth a hundred for good lighting.
We gathered together three good reasons to invest in lighting.
The tips were given by Innolux Sales and Marketing Director Tarja Jokinemi.
Do a favor to your eyes
The importance of lighting is growing, the more age is behind it.
Sufficient light can help with the problems that many face with age, as the accuracy of the vision decreases and more and more people suffer from blurred vision.
The need for light is also growing.
Twenty-three times as much light as twenty-three.
Therefore, the effects of light and the characteristics of the lighting are worth a hundred for health reasons.
A good light will give you enough light, but it will not fade, Jokinem says.
Create the beauty around you.
Beautiful interiors can only be displayed with the right lighting solutions.
At this point, the interior designer has the option to choose.
Popularity is the Japanese style that combines inelite, Scandinavianism and Japaneseism.
On the other hand, the modern and playful retro style, inspired by the 1970s, has grown to a boom with its strong colors, metal tones or ice cream colors.
Authenticity is just as fascinating as any other home decoration.
The materials now include wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
Express Your Personality
On the other hand, the house is invested more now than before, and the interior has become a way of expressing itself.
Instead of mass production, you want a customized, even bold light that has a story to tell.
People are clearly looking for Finnish and Nordic products, whose origins and designer are known.
So let’s be very design-conscious, Jokinemi says.
Home does not necessarily acquire the latest trend light, but a timeless classic, for which many years have been saved.
Some timeless, stylish and elegant classics like their surface from year to year, Jokinemi says.
Thank you and goodbye!
KooKoo showed the door to the Canadian striker after three games
KooKoo and the attacker Brendan O'Donnell's paths separate.
The Canadian striker played a total of three League matches without power points in the orange ball, KooKoo said in a statement.
O’Donnell moved to KooKoo in August with a one-year deal that included a trial period lasting until the end of September.
Last season, the 26-year-old played in Kunlund Red Star and KHL’s KRS Heilongjiang farm.
There is no information about O'Donnell's new band yet.
The player wants to show an example in recycling - goods go to the world in recycling boxes, plastic changed to paper
Nowadays, in addition to the games, the game’s special movement, the game’s player also recycles packaging materials.
The products of our customers are no longer packaged in plastic bags, but in recycled paper bags.
Products ordered from the online store are packaged in packages, for example, imported from importers.
All packages that come to us will be reused.
We can use the boxes a dozen times, as long as the package is in good condition that it can be used, says Ville Puurula of Oulu Gamer.
As a soft material, the company generally uses newspapers and other similar recycling materials.
Bubble plastics should be avoided as far as possible.
In the near future, we are also going to move to recycling materials.
The movement wants to set an example for others.
Recycling is, according to Woodland, not an extra effort.
There is no big problem starting to recycle.
It also generates financial savings when, for example, carton packs are re-used.
The recycling is naturally suited to the player’s activities, as, in addition to new products, the main product range of the movement includes, among other things, the games and equipment used.
Purchase of every fashion-conscious: One and the same shirt works in every outfit
Classic underwear works from season to season with a different outfit.
With their versatility, they create the foundation of a good wardrobe, as it is easy for high-quality classics to assemble a variety of clothes at an affordable price.
In the autumn, the most used classics in the wardrobe are high-quality seams.
This category also includes black polo.
A black needle made of natural material can not be mistaken.
Clothing can be combined with pants, jeans and jeans, and around it can create both a haunted set of dwellings and a fox style.
The Poloneule is suitable for both a young modern wearer and a classic sophisticated style turtle.
That's how you create style.
Autumn trendy look is born of golden brown and wide-length sphinx pants, black half-length and grey lace.
Along with other classics, a blue-green Scotch grape ham and red wine loafers, the classic semi-unit forms a feminine and sophisticated set of dwellings.
Bring a black shirt to the pole by combining it with trendy clothing items: jeans, high boots and thick socks.
Young and stylish!
Russia’s intelligence sabotage business has a long tradition
There is no reason to assume that the Russian Federation’s foreign intelligence SVR or the military intelligence GRU have abandoned this approach.
During the Soviet Union, the so-called DRG groups specialised in sabotage.
The name comes from the Russian-language word divertionsno-razveditelnaj group: sabotage and intelligence group.
Officials of the Soviet Security Service working in the west of the KGB are preparing detailed plans for important sites of sabotage, says the KGB’s western archivist Vasili Mitroh (1922-2004).
His information was published in Christopher Andrew's books in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
The targets included ports, shipyards, large shipyards, oil refineries and gas pipelines.
In Germany, the KGB acquired uniforms and equipment for covert operations for the DRG groups of the Bundeswehr, the railways, the guards and the road workers.
This trick was used by Russian paratroopers in Crimea in February 2014: they wore local Ukrainian police uniforms, established checkpoints for you leading from the peninsula to Ukraine, and separated Crimea from your motherland.
Agents during the Cold War hid supplies packed with mines, explosives, lighters and media on the ground for sabotage groups.
In 1998, a KGB secret was discovered in Switzerland, and the mine exploded when it was injected with a water slide by the authorities.
Police found four drivers in the county at night.
Police arrested four drivers across North Karelia on Friday and Saturday night.
In Joensuu, an 18-year-old boxing man blew 1.57 miles.
He drove two passengers at the beginning of Kajaani at four o’clock in the evening.
On the Polvijärve Kuorevaaranti road, a car crashed at four o’clock in the night, and a 19-year-old local man, who was alone in the car, flew 1.54 miles, according to police.
There were no serious injuries to him.
A 20-year-old local man driving a passenger car in the center of Outokummu blew a 1.33-mile alchometer.
The police suspect these male drivers of drunk driving and the driver of Polvijärvi Lake, in addition, of endangering traffic safety.
On Saturday morning, at the intersection of <0xC3><0x96>lölänti and Hoikanti, a 36-year-old man was driving a local wagon.
He's suspected of driving drunk.
Police are requesting observations of the shooting at Turu railway station after midnight.
Police say the man was abused in a parking lot in front of the station with the most life-threatening consequences.
It was recorded on the surveillance camera.
Suspects in dark pants and dark-haired brown or beige jackets left immediately after the knifework by dark farm car towards the bus station of Ratapihankatu.
One of the suspects left by bicycle Humaliston Street in the direction of downtown.
A pedestrian dies after being frozen under a bus in Pori
In Pori, a pedestrian died early Saturday morning after a bus crashed into him.
The accident occurred after four in the morning on the Rauman Road near Naittum.
The bus driver is not suspected of a crime.
Police are investigating the accident.
HPK keeps Riska in the rows of the end period, Lehtisen’s trial period is over
The sports manager of Hämeenlinna HPK, Mika Toivola, said that Filip Riska (centre) has been important to the team in initiatives, underpower play and in the defensive role of the quarterfield.
Filip Riska, who played at the start of the season, will continue the final season at Hämeenlinna HPK.
Experienced Riska, 33, success in the roles offered to him convinced the lead.
Filip has been an important player for us in initiatives, in underpowering and in the defensive role of the four-fielder.
While there are still improvements to be made, it is good for the young team to keep up with such an experienced player, commented HPK Sports Director Mika Toivola in the follow-up announcement.
I hope the risk value increases when playing the solution games of the Ice Hockey League.
The central attacker from St. Petersburg Riska has previously played too much hockey in JYP, Luka and Sport.
Attacker Oskari Lehtinen instead left without a deal after the test period.
A true story on tv today: The squirrel was left to die twice
The American Beck Weathers wrote the book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on a man’s own experience.
The film is based on them.
Everest is now getting his first night on Finnish TV.
In May 1996, a devastating snowstorm struck climbers at Mount Everest.
Baltasar Kormákuru’s 2015 guideline tells of the survival struggle that has been handled with crops.
The tragedy has been made in films - and documentaries - before.
Real events are happening in this case as well.
The tallest mountain in the world took the life of eight climbers 22 years ago.
Two of them were experienced tour directors: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
It was Hall who served as the Weathers' guide.
The life of Weathers could have been saved by an eye surgery performed before leaving Nepal.
As a result of it and air pressure, he lost his vision, which is why the peak occupation had to be left behind.
Rob Hall went on his journey and never returned.
However, Weathers’ struggle for life and death had only just begun.
When the storm rose, he disappeared and could no longer be found back in the camp.
When the man was searched, he was found in such a bad condition that he was not believed to survive.
Weathers was left to die.
As a miracle, however, he still got on his feet and found others.
The badly burned Weathers was thought to be still dying, and once again he was left on his own luck.
It is clear that, contrary to other expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, the fellow students began to believe in the possibility to the extent that he was being helped.
In the film, Beck Weathers is portrayed by Josh Brolin.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
Today is celebrated the 200-year-old Church of Eno
Today, the 200-year-old church of Eno is celebrated in the church.
The church was inaugurated on October 4, 1818, and a family celebration was prepared for Sunday in honor of the festive year.
The celebrations began at the Eno church site at 10 a.m. at the family fair, after which there was an antimatter at the Eno church hall.
The church was full.
517 people participated in the family event.
Mr. Armi Rautavuori was glad that so many people had come to the church.
It is a great joy for a long time and gives strength to work, Iron Mountain (in the picture) says.
The fire of the Danger Church has touched many, and it has not been ignored at the 200th Anniversary of the Church of Eno.
The church of Enon is now in the fire of the oldest church of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Joensuu.
The wooden church of Acceleration Danger was completed in 1770.
In the morning, an expedition was held in danger, in which the church was silenced and remembered as being destroyed by fire.
Photos and videos: My doctor slipped into Greece - the sea disappeared and the street turned into a river
A severe hurricane-like storm struck Greece on Saturday from noon.
The Mediterranean hurricane, my medicine, is called Zorba.
The Greek Meteorological Institute has issued a red weather warning for the regions of Attica, Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades and Crete.
Images taken from the area show a lot of flooding across Greece.
A video posted on Twitter shows how a river suddenly appeared between houses in the city of Kiato in the Corinthian area, instead of the street, due to flooding.
The second video shows how the car has been transported by floodwaters.
In the southern part of the Peloponnesian Peninsula, a strong wind caused a heavy seasweep.
The Embassy of Finland in Athens is instructing people on its Facebook page to prepare for the storm in Greece.
The embassy calls on the local authorities to follow the weather reports and instructions.
My Mediterranean hurricane, my medicine, brings heavy rains and even flooding.
According to a 2011 study published by CNN, drug use occurs only once or twice a year worldwide, typically in the fall of October, when sea temperatures are still high.
The now soaring storm left flooding in Tunisia and Libya before continuing its journey towards the north and Europe.
There is also concern in Greece about refugee camps on islands such as Lesboks.
Thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in the camps have limited access to adequate protection.
During the summer, the storm also leaves the areas destroyed by earthquakes in the surroundings of Athens.
In Greece, my doctors were also happy last November.
You should not go to the sea now, but your flights are still on schedule - on the threatened islands of Greece, thousands of Finns are currently on holiday
Excursions to the sea are cancelled and even if you walk, you should be careful not to overfly beetles or other cargoes in a storm.
Such guides have distributed fairly 3,500 in Greece for a Finnish holiday weekend through solar holidays.
Instructions are needed, as even the storm of Zorbas is predicted to peak on the island of Greece this weekend.
For example, in the vicinity of the island of Crete, the wind speed can rise up to 45 meters per second.
Increased rainfall increases the rage of the weather.
All travellers from Greece to Finland who have indicated their phone number through Sun Travel and Support have been warned of severe winds by text message, according to the tour operators.
In the air, the sun and heat
According to Inka Ikose, a specialist in solar travel communications, the worst of the holiday destinations have been avoided by early Saturday.
For example, flights have landed and increased according to normal schedules.
Of course, we keep track of the situation all the time.
We'll go ahead with security.
I supported media reporter Antonia Schroderus says that their flights have also gone on schedule.
We are constantly in touch with our local staff.
At least Crete was still calm, he told me on Saturday about the beginning.
The most popular islands in Greece, Rhodes and Crete currently have a total of 1,500 Finnish passengers.
In addition, a few hundred passengers are vacationing in smaller destinations.
For example, the worst storm on the island of Kos reached on Sunday morning.
On the other hand, on Saturday afternoon, Rhodos had a sunshine and the temperature was 27 degrees Celsius, the Icon of the Solar Journeys says.
Zorbaksen is expected to become the next Turkish giant, though slightly relieved.
We have already been in touch with Turkey and our staff there, and we have checked, for example, the number of Finns flying on the Antalya Tui, says Schroderus.
Shirly Karvis and Janni Huss, the very same evening outfits in the Mississippi Finals - that's how they reacted to the situation
As a media person and fitness beauty artist Janni Hussi arrived in the Miss Finland final on Saturday in an awkward evening outfit.
Hussi says he bought a suit from Meslew.
I went out and decided to trust the professionals who found me a wonderful outfit for tonight, Hussi smiles.
Exactly the same silver evening dress was also chosen by the director Shirly Karvinen.
The couple also noticed the same clothes and treated the situation with a laugh.
Karvinen told Evening-Sanom that he was in a hurry to prepare, and he had to get on the plane.
Hussi plays as a backstage and red carpet hunter in the mission finals, and she talks about the leading stars coming to the scene.
Huss has a fresh move because he moved from Kampi to Jätkäsaare on Friday.
I'm going to stay there for now, let's see what happens.
It is important that the new apartment has its own studio, Hussi thought.
Before moving, Hussi was on vacation alone in Greece.
It was great, I was only in the hotel for a week without leaving anywhere.
When I was stressed out, I got flu, but otherwise the holiday was really successful, Hussi says.
Shirly Karvis's behavior on the plane attracted a lot of attention - collected retirees' curious looks
The performer and 2016 Miss Finland Shirly Karvinen told the final of the Miss Finland final on the red carpet that she had enough to do with the radio shows and the pictures of Love Island Finland.
The speed has been sufficient even to the extent that Karvinen arrived in the finals directly from Finnair’s flight.
I put my hair on the machine.
This is the glamour.
I change my evening clothes at home, Karvin laughs.
Karvinen says that he also has his makeup in the middle of retirees.
His preparation also attracted the attention of fellow passengers.
I had a large mirror, and I could see people’s eyes.
Make-up was fun, at least for others.
Karvinen flies to Spain once a week.
In Marbella, he spends a few days at a time.
Karvinen says he enjoyed his wash of Love Island as a Finnish runner.
He also said that his experience so far has been staggering.
Karvinen says he went to the show's singles on Friday.
It's kind of rough.
These are people's true feelings, Karvinen describes the feelings of the program's singles.
How do you dress up over-the-top shoes?
The Three Perfect Examples
Classical clothing is a piece of clothing that works from season to season in a different garment than in a garment.
Often classics are decades old, but sometimes they can accommodate even the most modern individuals.
A few years ago, the cross-country boots of the season of September and winter have gone nowhere.
According to its name, the boots above the knee repeat stylishly year after year and season after season.
Looking boots share users' opinions, but a bold model is worth trying, well - courageously.
Over-the-counter boots are suitable for any type of housing.
Whether it’s jersey, tie, tulle or trikot, the simple leather or artificial leather boot works.
Long boots look good both in party categories and in box suits.
Black over-the-counter boots are also suitable for stylish dwellings.
They appropriately balance the femininity of a pink, velvety pleated body and a cute, velvety needle.
Fresh but autumnal stylish archery suit for romantic taste.
A strong and slightly retro-minded habitat comes from a long copper-brown scissor, over-the-counter socks, eye-catching earrings and long sleeves.
While there is some sophistication in over-the-counter boots, they are also perfectly suited for a relaxed leg with a t-shirt, long shorts and a trendy flagship.
Very easy and yet so stylish!
Two robotic trucks are starting to operate in Espoo
They operate at the end of the year and take passengers on board, the city of Espoo informs.
The robotic trucks of Otaniem will play the role of a bus simulator, because next spring the area will be expected to launch traffic on the robotic bus.
The project will develop and pilot robotic vehicle traffic that operates all year round and test the technical functionality of the vehicles under the conditions of Finland.
In the experiment, you will find out how robotic cars are doing with the current street grid.
At the same time, the city offers robotic bus developers the opportunity to develop technology in a real environment,” says Johanna Nyberg, Chief Traffic Manager.
For the first time, robotic cars travel fully automatically among other transports without special transport arrangements.
The safety of vehicles is always the responsibility of an auxiliary passenger on board.
Vehicles were constantly sensing their environment with a number of different sensors and assessing whether the road was free.
If not, they will interpret whether an obstacle has been detected, such as a vehicle, a bicycle or a snowmobile, says Harri Santamala, CEO of Sensible 4, responsible for the development of robotics.
Robot cars run all autumn three days a week: Tuesdays at 13-15.30, Wednesdays at 10-15 and Thursdays at 10-15.
Robot cars stop at six stops along the route and take passengers on board.
Robot car stops identify the parking markings.
The safest way to get there is from the stop number 1 on the island of Ottawa.
Mokoma bassist fell from the floor in the middle of the room and was injured
The Mokoma group informs about the surprising situation on its Facebook page via the Tampere Packaging Room.
The Tampere Packroom received a dramatic turn on Saturday, when the band’s bassist Santtu Hämäläinen fell off the bench in the middle of the performance.
The situation happened when the band was pulling out the last part of the night.
The wrist was broken.
The band will inform you on their Facebook page.
"We're alive!"
Yesterday, Santtu stabbed the floor with the last violin and broke his ribs.
We hope for a quick recovery for the metal brother!
The rest of the tour deals with the alternate crew, the pages read.
Fans of Mokoma are concerned about the image update, where the bassist-Santu claws the plaster in his hand on the bed.
This news was expected, there was quite a lot of concern about how bad it went.
The relief is great, the bones will fortunately improve over time.
Let's make a quick recovery for Santu and have a good tour for the other band plus the tourer!
And thank you for yesterday, it was a wonderful play, but you promise to leave such a strong drama away from the end of the plays in the future?
Police monitor hunting in North Karelia and Savo
On Friday and Saturday, the Eastern Finland police force carried out hunting controls with the Metsähalla government and the Finnish Dispute Centre in North Karelia and Upper Savoy, the police force’s group members told social media on Saturday.
The main focus of the control was on the legality and authorization of hunting.
Some hunters checked the hunting card and the hunting permit required by the state.
In addition, the permits for holding hunting weapons and the permissible number of cartridges for self-propelled weapons used in channelling were checked.
According to the police, 112 hunters were inspected during the inspection, and only one hunter was found during the inspection, which did not have the required hunting permit.
The hunter was sentenced to 12 days for unauthorized fishing.
In addition, police arrested 133 drivers of the vehicle, two of whom are suspected of driving drunk.
In addition, the patrols dealt with five traffic offences in criminal proceedings, the police once.
To sum up, hunters comply very well with the hunting authorization.
Many hunters were surprised by the control.
One hunter said, "I've been hunting in the area for 50 years and this was the first time someone checked permissions."
The East Finnish police station will continue its hunting surveillance in the autumn, in conjunction with other supervisory authorities.
Mykkänen to go to Turkey to follow Syrian quota refugees’ choices
Interior Minister Kai Mykkänen (co.) will travel to Turkey in the coming days to follow the selection of quota refugees coming to Finland.
Finland has decided to take 530 Syrian refugees from the Turkish refugee camps this year.
Election trips are usually made a couple of times a year, with representatives from the Immigration Agency, the Ministry of Labour and Trade and the police.
The delegation is already conducting interviews in Turkey.
The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) first selects people who are particularly vulnerable to the condition.
In practice, it has meant people who are deemed to be in a particularly distressing position in refugee camps, such as single-parent families, disabled and sick, women and children.
More people will be selected from the group of people coming to Finland than they are in the quota, because in practice, some of them will not come for various reasons.
Mykkänen will also meet with Turkish Interior Minister Süleyman Soylu and NGOs at the border with Syria.
Minister of the Interior Ilkka Salmi is also involved on the trip.
Talks on raising quotas
Finland has been accepting quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, there have been 750 refugees per year.
The quota was for a couple of years per year 1,050, but there has been no agreement in the government since then on raising it.
The Assembly has advocated a rise in the quota, but the project has recently fallen to the blue resistance.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) recently announced the gradual increase of the quota to 1,500 to 2,000 people per year.
Mykkäsen’s visit will be the first one in the government to be made on the spot by the Minister of Interior to monitor the choice of quota refugees.
The previous interior ministers Petteri Orpo (cook.) and Paula Rissko (cook.) managed to move on to their new duties before the visits were organised.
Finland receives <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10,000 of support from the EU for each refugee in a particularly vulnerable situation.
Now let's go to the polls - no longer know whether to cry or laugh
Karjalainen reported on a bill last Saturday to amend the Animal Protection Act.
The article came to the view that the draft law essentially prohibits the holding of all animals in relation to production animals, pets or other business activities that are not specifically authorised by ministerial regulations.
Therefore, all other animals except those specifically mentioned in the Regulation are strictly prohibited.
If the bill ends, it means that we are rejecting in Western democracies the general principle that the law separately prohibits activities that endanger the security of society or good manners.
Now we are basically stipulating a ban on any activity that is not authorized by law or regulation separately.
The change means that nothing new can be tried, for example, in the business, and nothing else can be done until a law or regulation has been passed.
In general, the government’s action in lawmaking has been weak.
If we now go to the way that in Finland, basically, everything is forbidden, what is not allowed separately, we no longer know whether to cry or laugh.
I have no doubt that the Animal Protection Act does not require an update.
But this bill does not belong to democracy.
Unfortunately, I do not know the Constitution very well, but can it accept such a procedure "everything is prohibited, which is not permitted by law or regulation separately"?
Hopefully there will be a reasonable minister who will stop the progress of such a bill.

Turkey calls for mobile phones to be recharged in the event of a storm
The Zorba hurricane in Greece is expected to move to Turkey on Sunday.
Meteorologists warned seamen, fishermen and farmers of the country's western coast on Saturday of the Greek storm, according to CNN Türk.
The Tropical Storm is said to be moving along the coast from the south to the north during the day.
Disaster and Emergency Authorities on Saturday called on citizens from the start to recharge their mobile phones before the storm and to ensure the functionality of the internet so that people can get up-to-date status updates, according to local news agency Anadolu Ajansi.
People are encouraged to stay at home and away from windows, for example, to move garden furniture away from the wind.
Turkey is expected to have a strong rainfall and the wind is expected to blow 28-33 meters per second.
Red weather warning in Greece
On Saturday, the Greek Meteorological Service issued a red weather warning to southern Greece for the regions of Attica, Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades and Crete.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Greek travel agencies have warned Finns in Greece of the Zorba storm.
The Embassy of Finland in Athens also issued a storm warning.
Passengers were invited to follow the weather reports and local authorities’ instructions.
A while ago, when I got in touch, there was a strong wind and it was raining.
The people were very calm, Laura Aaltonen, head of the Tui travel agency, told STT on Saturday.
Aaltonen described the situation as similar on Saturday night.
Even by the evening, the foreign ministry had not received any messages from the Finns in distress.
In Greece, ships did not operate in several ports on Saturday, local news agency Amna said.
Boat trips to the sea were cancelled on Saturday, travel agencies told STT.
According to the Finnish Embassy in Athens, temporary disruptions were expected to occur in air and shipping.
Finnair was told on Saturday that the situation was being monitored actively.
Kimi Räikkönen's reason for Mercedek's improvement over Ferrari
Ferrari’s Kimi Räikkönen admitted that the worst competitor Mercedes was too hard a piece in the time of the Russian gp.
However, there is no reason to panic at the Ferrari camp, the experienced driver estimates.
They were just faster than us, but it's not a big deal.
Our cars were the best all weekend so far, but they were just too fast, drove fourth and clearly left Mercedes behind the pace with their colleague Sebastian Vettel.
Ferrar had a hard time in the previous race in Singapore.
He was asked what was the result of the sudden fall of Mercedeks.
They seem to be going faster than we are - as simple as it is.
If I knew the reason for that, we'd probably go at the same pace as them.
But I don’t know that more than anyone else.
This is a constant guess, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
In times of time, a rare delicacy was seen for Räikkösen’s future farmhouse Sauber.
Charles Leclerc, who replaced Ferrari in the next season, was seventh, and Marcus Ericsson also won the final time session.
For a Swedish citizen, the 10th starting point is best for over three years.
And even though in the second driving session only five drivers left behind completely, the result was still tasty for Sauber.
Or maybe it’s an encouraging thought for the future?
Yes, if you compare where they were from the beginning, then the step forward has been big.
Next year is a different story, so let’s look, let’s look.
Robert Helenius, Erkan Teper: "Robbe is back"
The match between Robert Helenius and Erkan Teper last night in Stuttgart went smoothly.
The German was a more prolific party in the circle, but he did not get a good hit.
Clearly more extensive Helenius controls the game with his hard series, which were well-received.
The Finn was also clearly in better physical condition than Teper.
The solution finally came in the eighth inning, when Helenius flew to the left directly to Teper.
It was so hard, that the bartender in front of the public did not even try to get up from the carpet.
After the victory was assured, Helenius winded quite moderately.
During the interview, he initially expressed a good atmosphere created by the public and his opponents.
Then he switched to the Finnish language for a moment.
Thank you to all spectators and Finnish supporters.
We took the belt with us today.
Helenius was happy right after the game.
It was a huge victory for Helen’s career.
There might even be a chance to reach the World Cup final, Helenius commented to Iktalehde before the match.
Instead, the loss could have settled the whole punch line.
Of course it has come to mind.
Helenius, 34, admitted that he was no longer younger than Teper.
The number of victims of the Indonesian disaster could increase
According to The Guardian, the country’s vice-president is calling for a clear rise in casualties.
According to the country’s vice president, Yusuf Kalla, the total number of victims could rise to thousands.
Difficult conditions
Rescuers are looking for the survivors and also the perpetrators from the worst affected areas of the island of Sulawesi: Please from the port city and its neighboring province of Donggala.
So far, all the victims are from Palu, the situation in Donggala is not yet clear.
Hundreds of people are missing and about 540 are seriously injured.
There are still people in the collapsed buildings that rescuers have not been able to get out.
For example, the Roa Roa hotel in Palu has collapsed.
Rescuers say they have heard the cries of the people in distress about the ruins, but the lack of ravage gear has delayed the start of rescue work.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has ordered the rescue and rape of the army.
There is a need for the army and its equipment, because in the disaster zone, electricity and telecommunications connections are intersecting in many places.
Fuel reserves are also depleting.
The dubious response of the Miss Finland finalist and the long-awaited reflection caused laughter
Billnäs Ruuk is currently choosing a new Miss Finland.
During the interview round, each Mississippi finalist was asked a question.
The finalists questioned the glass bowl on stage.
Especially the finalist number six Emilia Anttikoske, 23, the hesitant answer got the audience present with a sweet but good evening laughs.
The question asked by Anttikos had come through Facebook.
The user Pirkko-Ella wanted to know which is the last book the mission finalist has read.
Anttikoski thought about his answer with good habits before he started to doubt.
Thanks for the question, Pirkko-Ella.
The last book I’ve read is..., Anttikoski said thinking.
Anttikoski continued his reply with a laughing outcry in the public:
The last book I've read is...
I’ve read books at school!
Probably something to do with economics.
So the last book I’ve read is someone in economics, Anttikoski replied.
After his reply, Anttikoski received the public's loud applause with laughter.
In the past, on a mission tour, Anttikoski attracted attention because he did not want to pose in underwear because of his principle.
The 2018 Miss Finland will be crowned at 9 p.m., when the crown will be given last year’s Miss Finland by Michaela Söderholm.
The Sike Apple Peppers Takes His Language Back
This recipe is for those of you who have good, acidic oranges on their own, because the domestic apple is at a shocking price in the store.
You may have to buy a pear, although I think that pear tree is already growing on many occasions.
This cake can also be made only with apples if you do not want to buy pepperoni.
Of course, the taste is more varied if the cake is also filled with its pepper.
Cut the apples and peppers and remove the seedlings.
Viipaloi.
Melt in a pot.
Cut the eggs and sugar into foam and then add the cornmeal powder and melt the pot.
Combine the cornstarch (maize) with the bread powder and add it to the dish.
Add the almond butter and wheat butter, mix well.
Cover the pancakes with bread paper, pour 2 tablespoons of sugar into the bottom of the pan and spread the pepper slices over the sugar.
Slice half of the dough over the peppermint pieces and the apple slices over the dough.
Spread the end of the dough over the apple slices.
Bake in the oven at 180 degrees for about an hour until the surface is beautifully brown.
Let it cool in a jar and then cancel the serving vessels.
Cut the cake only when properly cooled.
The cake is fragile in its structure and grinds easily, as the dough contains butter and corn flour without gluten.
The International Criminal Literacy Event will be held in January
In January, the Kuusamo Ruka will host the first international literature festival focusing on criminal literature in the Nordic countries.
The Nordic Noir event program consists of interviews, panel discussions, and other literature-themed program numbers, as well as jazz music.
The Swedish writer Jens Lapidus and Erik Axel Sund are among the Swedish writers Jerker Eriksson and H<0xC3><0xA5>kan Axlander Sundquist.
In addition to the Swedish names, the event also attracts writers from Iceland, Norway and Finland.
Finnish writers are represented by Max Seeck.
According to the organizers of the festival, the northern location, nature, the dark season and the unique environment of Kuusamo provide a framework for a unique literary experience.
Status symbols do not attract friends - Four Facts Popular
What makes a person popular, charismatic or admired?
Researchers at the University of Sydney have characterised two types of "coolity" consisting of slightly different characteristics: the generally attractive coolness and, in part, the opposite of the differential-thinking coolness.
Attractively cool people, according to the researchers, had many socially desirable traits: they were out-of-the-way, friendly, fit and qualified.
The dissidents were once again characterised by distance, independence, rebelliousness and fragmentation.
They were thirsty for experience and only a little bit of outside assessment.
Both types combined good self-esteem and a stable emotional life.
The role of hardworking is no longer cool: high status in adolescence may not necessarily lead to success later in life.
This is according to a U.S. study published in the journal Child Development in 2014.
Young people who were dating early, ticketing, applying for good-looking pores and seeking the favor of others, as young adults, had an increased risk of using shifts and committing crimes.
In their human relationships, they were able to cope less than their previously unrecognized age mates.
High-status messages read buses, badge bags or watches don’t make a person cool – or at least really attractive.
In a study published in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science in August, the vast majority of people were more willing to become friends with their regular marketing team than with those wearing their brands — despite the fact that most of them chose their brands in the event of acquaintancement.
If you are on the Greek holiday islands, be careful!
There's a thunderstorm hitting - weather warning screams red
During the weekend in southern Greece it is possible to rain as much as in Finland during an average of six months.
The Zorbas thunderstorm strikes Greece over the weekend.
Be prepared if you are staying in the Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades or Crete.
The storm is very strong, so the Embassy of Finland in Athens announces it on its Facebook page.
The Greek Meteorological Service has issued a red weather warning to the regions.
The upcoming storm is also reported by the weather service on Foreca’s blog.
According to the report, the storm's hardest timbers are up to 45 meters per second.
For comparison, the first week in Finland, the Kuisma hurricane blew the fastest in 31 meters per second.
However, according to the blog, the biggest concern of the Zorbas storm is not the wind, but the heavy rains.
Over the weekend, more than 300 millimetres of water can be reached in southern Greece.
It accounts for about half of Finland’s annual rainfall.
Weather service Severe Weather Europe has shared a video on the development of the storm on its Facebook page.
Earlier this week, Hurricane Zorbas caused flooding in Tunisia and Libya.
Do you recognize Love Island -Ankun men's basketball?
Confusing Youtube Videos
Very few people know that in the series Love Island Finland, the beauty of Anku, which has been killed by many men, also appears in strange Youtube videos published in 2010.
In the video, Anku advises professionals, among other things, to make blackfish from an old economic paper roll.
Anku also shows in a sympathetic style how the socks can be worn on the shoulder of a seed that grows with the right tips.
Now the Easter herbs are being grown, but we do it in a little surprising way, Anku points out and presents the sawdust, socks and grass seeds, which he makes a seedling.
You can watch the videos below or on the Ankun Youtube channel here.
Valtteri Bottas whispered and purged adrenaline in Sochi - will he be Hamilton's assistant on Sunday?
Valtteri Bottas was a little more agitated ten minutes after his Russian gp's pitching pitch when he was in front of the media.
A great round left behind the Mercedeks for the first time, Lewis Hamilton, and was certainly a critical critic of the Finnish time this season.
Nice tour.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he left in the middle of the solution.
It feels good, I'm still shaking a little bit, Bottas found out.
I’ve only been on the polo once this year, in Austria (mid-summer), so the time has passed quite a bit.
This track has been good for me before, and I got good rounds again.
It is not easy to skip on the path of the war, so the departure is particularly important.
And, of course, Bottas was able to answer the question of whether he will win tomorrow or whether Hamilton is approaching the World Cup.
My starting point in the race is definitely that I’m trying to win.
There can be no other goal when leaving the ball, Bottas whispered.
But as a team, we're fighting for both championships.
Lewis’s lead to Sebastian Vettel is quite big and the difference to me is very big, so we have to keep it in mind.
Let's see what happens, but Bottas is a supplement.
Hamilton was really happy with Bottax’s success after the drive, and the Mercedeks housetop Toto Wolffill was also tasted.
Lewis had the intention of defeating Valtteri, but he did not succeed in the standings.
Valtteri knows he has to do everything he can to defeat Lewis.
And he was so loaded that adrenaline splashed out of his ears, Wolff flashed.
Asked whether the farm would allow Bottax and Hamilton to drive the reedist, Wolff replied in the objection.
We'll discuss tomorrow morning, and see how the race goes.
Kiteeläinen Erno Kinnunen wins the Finnish Rally Championship
The SM series of rally cars rarely ended.
Never before have the brothers ended up at the same time as the Finnish champions.
Now it was done by Eerik and Henrik Pietarinen in a decision-making environment in Turun and Salon, because Eerik won the SM1 and Henrik SM2 class.
Kiteeläin Erno Kinnunen secured the best achievement of his career when he finished third in the SM4 category of the Finnish doubles championship.
Honda Civic competitor Kinnunen and cartoonist Ville Mäkelä started the competition in Turin on the basis that the starting points were clear: the placement in the top group would back the SM title.
In the dark of Friday night, the duo was forced to give a match when some of the additional lights cheated on another special test.
That was the third time I had to score a third goal.
In such a situation, designs are not suitable.
On Saturday, only Jussi Tepo, who was in the second series, was followed, Kinnunen said.
Syria calls on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops
The Syrian foreign minister has called on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
Foreign Minister Walid Muallem, speaking at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, said foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and without conditions.
Mualem said that foreign forces are fighting terrorism in Syria, and the war against terrorists is "almost over".
In his UN speech, Muallem also appealed to Syrian refugees to return to their homeland.
However, the seven-year war will not be over.
More than 360,000 people have died in the war.
U.S. Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Friday that a meeting of the presidents of France, Russia and Turkey is scheduled for October.
Not exactly the Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched the Supreme Court Drama on TV
Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh and Professor Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of harassment, got an exceptional number of people out of the boxes.
The U.S. Supreme Court’s nomination drama received at least 20 million people next to its televisions on Thursday.
At the time, Kavanaugh, appointed by Donald Trump, and California professor Blasey Ford, who accused him of harassment, were telling their story before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
According to preliminary results, the interviews were followed by six main channels: ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC, with a total of 20.4 million viewers.
In addition to them, online consultation followed several millions more.
NBC reported that 6.8 million people watched livestreams, and CNN reported that it had made its record of 8.2 million a year at the start of the live stream.
CNN’s number is rising to more than 10 million, according to YouTube and Facebook trackers.
Fox News Digital also made 8.0 million launches.
The digital launches are the channels’ own, the TV viewer numbers are from the research and data analytics company Nielsen.
Nielsen will publish the final readings on Monday, but they’re going to be awkward anyway.
Rarely exceeds <0x24>20 million
Over 20 million spectators in the United States usually only have access to sports and entertainment major Oscars and Grammys, as well as occasional political events such as presidential speeches and presidential campaigns in 2016.
The U.S.'s most watched annual program, the NFL's finale of the American Football League, is of course on the way to the Super Bowl.
This year, the Super Bowl gathered around 103 million people on NBC.
Last year, Trump’s first speech to Congress saw a total of about 48 million people and 30 million people who were elected to office, according to Nielsen.
A Highly Important Thing
The Supreme Court’s appointment of a judge is an extremely significant case in the United States, as offices are lifelong.
Trump was already able to appoint a new judge when Antonin Scalia died in early 2016 and Republicans managed to prevent then-President Barack Obama from appointing him as his successor.
The second place opened when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced that he will be retired this year.
Kennedy was appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan, but he was the so-called "Vahan language" on a number of issues, the vote of which could resolve the nine-member court's position.
He was a proponent of the right to abortion and the rights of sexual minorities and, for example, in 2015, decided by a vote that same-sex persons were granted the right to marry throughout the federal state.
Kavanaugh is much more conservative in terms of positions.
His choice of the Supreme Court may confine the right to decades of conservative power.
Children have the right to access information from their parents
Only parents of children under the age of 10 can see their children’s health information from the Kanta service.
It's a big problem, it's wrong, and it's weird.
Initially, the situation with the Kanta service was of course even more worrying: parents weren’t allowed to view even minor health data or prescriptions.
The situation was temporarily remedied in the autumn of 2016 for children under 10 years of age.
Since then, the practices have been promised to be corrected, but the repair has been amazingly long.
The repair is now underway - in 2020.
Since the problem is clear, the amendment of the legal basis should not have been more than a transparent matter.
After that, the concept of the model is about pressing the button: now that the powder is held, it is opened.
Of course, a child can show his/her information to his/her parents - if he/she has a bank ID or an official identification card.
But how many 10-year-olds are there?
The identity card is payable, and a 10-year-old is not even allowed bank IDs.
In practice, therefore, the information of the four-year high school cannot be seen by anyone other than by requesting it to be printed.
It is not so much about parental rights as it is about children's rights.
It is extremely important for the care of the child that parents can be involved in it.
Of course, the right of adolescents to privacy must be taken care of.
Even minors can have family situations where it is not possible to talk freely about everything.
Often they relate to sexual health, of which free care is a profoundly important human right.
In the U.S., the FBI began charging Kavanaugh with harassment charges
According to U.S. media reports, the FBI is investigating at least two women's allegations of harassment.
One of the women was hearing the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this week.
Kavanaugh has denied allegations of alleged sexual harassment during his studies.
U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the allegations at the request of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
The investigation should not take more than a week.
According to the Washington Post, it is a criminal investigation of a border cross-examination, and it does not necessarily become public.
Man threatens to kill police officers at police station in Kajaani
The deceased sniper continued his bowling even in the chamber.
Police say they have ordered the man to "relax" in the police prison.
The police were threatened by the suspect on Saturday night in Kajaan.
Officials report the case, which began when a fair 30-year-old man challenged a dispute in a central restaurant.
The man first abused another client within the nutrition movement.
This resulted in the removal from the restaurant.
Outside the fighter attacked another man by throwing him to the ground.
When the third party tried to intervene, the man also hit him.
The triple-shooting led to a police call.
The party arrested the man and took him to Kajaan police station, police say.
The suspect continued to act aggressively at the police station.
The man kicked another policeman in the leg.
He threatened to kill and abused the police.
Police said the man had been sent to the police prison to "relax".
The man is suspected of three abuses and the official's violent opposition.
Aid organisations are preparing to start work on Indonesian Sulawesi - "Clean water is the most urgent"
UNICEF and other international aid organizations are ready to help on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, said Kirsi Haru, the head of information for UNICEF in Finland.
Local authorities are leading the rescue work, but the need for additional assistance is already evident at this stage.
UNICEF operates in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programs in Indonesia.
In addition to normal operations, Unicefil is always fully prepared for emergencies, Haru says.
The first task now is to find people in the ruins, both the survivors and the dead.
Please, in the city of Sulawesi, rescue operations are underway, but the situation is a little more north of Donggala.
There are still places where connections do not work.
The aid measures are difficult because the roads are also broken, Haru says.
The buildings in Sulawesi are often lightweight, so the damage caused by the earthquake and tsunami is large.
When survivors have been found, they need protection -- first of all, tents, for example -- and clean water.
In times of crisis, clean water is the most urgent.
First, people are most often able to offer water treatment tablets, which are also in stock with Unicefilla.
Water systems are aimed at repairing as soon as possible, but in an emergency, water is first transported, for example, by cranes.
In times of crisis, many children get rid of their parents.
Finding family members and reunifying families is part of the UNICEF task field.
The World Food Programme (WFP), which is part of the United Nations, is also organised by the World Food Programme (WFP).
In the initial stage, the funds raised in the past will be used for emergency assistance.
Among other things, UNICEF has already started raising funds to help Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami victims.
Billionaire Elon Musk to end Tesla’s presidency – <0x24>20 million in fines for tweets
Elon Musk, the founder of space-structures and electric car companies, will avoid fraud by a deal with the U.S. Securities Commission.
Billionaire Elon Musk will end his job as president of Tesla's government and agree to a <0x24>20 million fine.
Musk opposes the task as part of an agreement he concluded with the U.S. Securities Supervisory Authority.
With the agreement, Musk avoids allegations of fraud.
The U.S. Securities Commission (SEC) threatened Musk with securities scams because of tweets he sent in August.
In those, Musk wrote that he was preparing electric car company Tesla to withdraw from the stock market, which led to the company's stock price rising rapidly.
According to the agreement, Musk will not be allowed to serve as Tesla’s president for three years.
In addition, Tesla must appoint a new "independent member" to its board and include two "independent leaders" in its management group.
Tesla must also set up a committee to monitor Musk's communications.
Musk will continue as CEO of Tesla.
In addition to personal fines of <0x24>20 million, Tesla will also have to pay similar fines to a financial supervisor.
Twitter leads investors to misunderstandings
According to the SEC, Muskin’s tweets led investors and Tesla’s shareholders to be misled.
Musk claimed that he had secured funding to buy Tesla back from the stock exchange as a private stock company.
According to billionaire tweets, the company would have been bought off the stock market for <0x24>420.
Tesla’s stock price rose by more than ten percent per day after tweets, but declined later.
According to the SEC, Musk’s allegations had no basis.
According to the supervisor, he had not actually negotiated the funding he claimed.
He had also not discussed the withdrawal of the stock market with another management group or the company’s government.
On Friday, the price fell 14 percent when the SEC reported a fraud allegation.
The news agreement is expected to re-establish the company's course.
The final sentence is not a reason.
Of course, the church's watches don't ring when the visas don't move.
It's a technical fault.
The tower of the Helsinki Cathedral has stopped.
Visors show at 12 o'clock.
The situation is like a medium horror movie: even though the church crypt would sound like a manana and the urus would sound like themselves.
Of course it is not, but the clock has stopped for a technical reason: it has broken.
It has been seen by the repairer, but some part has been broken and a new part is waiting for it, suntio Eveliina Jamsen says.
At the same time, Jamsen confirms the fact that the Church in Helsinki -Twitter account has already mentioned.
In fact, the account mentions that the last sentence is not a reason to stop the clock.
Jamsen says the church clocks don't ring because of the fault.
