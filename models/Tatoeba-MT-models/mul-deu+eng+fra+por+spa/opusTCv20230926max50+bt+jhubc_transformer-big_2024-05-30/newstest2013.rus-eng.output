Republican strategy to resist Obama's re-election
Republican leaders have justified their policy by the need to combat counterfeiting in elections.
However, the Brennan Center considers the last myth, claiming that cases of election counterfeiting in the United States are more rare than cases of deaths from lightning strikes.
In addition, Republican lawyers only counted 300 cases of election counterfeiting in the United States in ten years.
One thing can be said with certainty: these new trends will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada, the United States is responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
That is why most state governments have passed laws since 2009 that complicate the process of registration or voting.
This phenomenon took a new toll after the November 2010 elections, which brought Republicans 675 new seats in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills were passed in just one year in 2011, limiting voting rights in 41 states.
The new election laws require the electorate to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws shorten the period of early voting, abolish the right to register the electorate on the day of the election and deprive citizens of the right to vote.
Prior to the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to present an identity card with a photograph.
Indiana became the first state to introduce such a requirement.
In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of the Indian law.
The Republican authorities hastened to spread this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have initiated bills obliged voters to present photo IDs in 34 states.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have such a universal identity card as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, i.e. 21 million people who have reached the age required to vote, do not have an identity card with a photo issued by their state government body.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a document.
At the same time, the cost of obtaining the required identity card often exceeds one hundred dollars.
The new restrictions are disproportionately affecting young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than <0x24>35,000, 18% of citizens aged 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have the required photo ID.
But that's not all.
Students - voters who are thought to vote for candidates from Democrats are not allowed in several states to use an identity card with a photograph issued by their educational institution.
However, the same states allow members of fishing and hunting clubs, which mainly vote for Republicans, to use the certificates issued by these clubs to vote.
Until 2004, no state required evidence of the existence of U.S. citizenship to vote.
For the first time, such a requirement was introduced in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than ten states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are obviously aimed at limiting the voting of Latin Americans.
Two-thirds of Latin American voters are believed to vote in favor of the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers initiated laws in 2011 abolishing the registration of voters on the day of voting in eight states.
They also restricted the right of individuals or groups to provide assistance to those wishing to register.
This restriction did not go without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 election, the voter registration campaign helped put some 10 million citizens on the lists.
At the same time, the measures taken since 2009 have led to a 17 per cent drop in the number of new voters registered in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have passed laws in five other states aimed at reducing the period of early voting.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of the voters who voted early were African Americans, although the latter accounted for only 13% of the total number of voters in the state.
The same thing happened to the Latin Americans.
With only 11% of voters, they accounted for 24% of citizens who voted prematurely.
Unlike the whites, who made up 76% of the voters, only 46% of those who voted in advance.
Of course, the legislators of the Democrats and their supporters are actively opposed to the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Several bills were vetoed by Democratic governors.
The most ambiguous laws were suspended with the intervention of the United States Attorney General.
This allowed to partially limit the negative consequences.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have passed laws requiring a photo ID.
However, the new rules that have come into force will undoubtedly hinder the exercise of the right to vote in the 2012 elections.
Critics of the Democrats condemn the bias of the laws that have been passed, seeing in them an obvious tendency to influence the results of the 2012 election in key states.
The Brennan Center’s 2011 report shows that the states that passed these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electorate to win the presidential election.
Too early to say with confidence that these legislative changes at the electoral system level will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential election.
There is only one thing, no doubt: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Screening of prostate cancer: to pass the test or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes produces false, false-negative, and sometimes false-positive results that lead to useless medical intervention.
Men, and so reluctantly undergoing dissemination, have something to suspect even more.
To pass the test or not?
We asked for the opinion of two experts.
In studies conducted in the United States, there have been numerous cases of infection among the groups studied, so the data obtained is difficult to interpret and any clear recommendations are difficult to draw up.
Another study, this time European, found different rates of mortality in those patients who underwent screening and those who did not.
This study also showed, after 12 years of observation, that the likelihood of metastasis was 30-40% higher in those who did not undergo screening.
Therefore, I would recommend taking the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40, if one of the immediate relatives had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American descent are also at increased risk.
The key point is to make the right decision as soon as the cancer is detected.
Cancer can be both aggressive and life-threatening.
The patient needs to clarify the degree of risk of his cancer, offering him possible options, without mandatory treatment of prostate cancer, which does not pose a risk to life in the long run, but making a choice, in these cases, in favor of active monitoring of the disease.
To date, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer will not undergo treatment, as their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a life-threatening threat.
We will offer them active observation, and if the disease begins to progress, we will begin treatment.
Increasingly, we are precisely defining the criteria for making a decision about who should or should not take a course of treatment.
So, I would recommend going through the test anyway.
But it is also important to consult with your doctor to determine whether or not to pass this test.
In collaboration with the International Association of Urology, Movember created an instrument that allows to assess all the pros and cons of passing the PSA test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of scientific research, adherence to a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of the disease.
It is believed that if all people were eating well and moving enough, 30% of cancer cases could be prevented.
“If no one had smoked anymore, this figure would have risen to at least 50%,” said Andre Bolier, a press secretary for the Canadian Cancer Association.
However, it is estimated that 10% of cancer cases are caused by heredity.
Several types of cancer remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Association, smoking remains a priority despite a reduction in the number of smokers.
Smoking is associated with 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is a risk factor for many others.
It does a great deal of harm to people’s health.
"There are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today," said Andre Bolé, a press secretary.
Encouraging fact: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.
Weighs
According to the CAR data, overweight and obesity also contribute to the onset of the disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, the colon and rectum, the esophagus, the pancreas and the uterus.
“Research shows that regular physical activity throughout a lifetime protects against colon cancer,” the Association adds.
Nutrition
The association also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too large quantities, it increases the risk of colon cancer.
It is also important to avoid sausages.
Preservation of meat by squeezing, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
“The latter can damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer,” the Association explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists have been researching the effect of vitamin supplements on the development of cancer.
But at this point the results of these studies cannot be called unambiguous.
According to the SCC, studies of vitamin E give contradictory results.
If one of them showed a decrease in the risk of developing prostate cancer, the other gave the opposite result.
In the assessment of the impact of vitamin D on the development of cancer, there is also no complete clarity.
However, Mr. Bolio stresses that his concerns and family history are important to discuss with a doctor.
"The failure of the analysis does not lead to cancer."
Boson Higgs in detail
Last summer, the report that scientists may have been able to detect the Higgs boson caused real excitement – and not without reason.
It is believed that this boson explains the mass of all the particles in the universe, not much or little.
In addition, it is the last particle whose existence has been predicted within the framework of the Standard Model – our best, or at least the “less perfect” description of the nature and behavior of matter – but which has previously not been detected in an experimental way.
But physicists are not entirely sure that it is the Higgs boson.
We know, undoubtedly, that we are dealing with a really new particle and that it strongly resemble the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, the new data presented this week at a major physical congress in Kyoto seems to confirm this, although some data is not yet available for complete certainty.
Let’s imagine what this is about the Higgs boson, as the chances of making a mistake seem minimal, and let’s see what that means.
There is, in this world, one law that is absolutely inevitable, that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
To circumvent this rule there is no possibility, don’t even try too hard, otherwise harm yourself.
But although the physics of elementary particles is a rather strange world, it turns out that there is also one law of a similar nature in it: the principle of Pauli's exclusion, which postulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space in the same state of time.
Based on this, physicists divide particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find good-natured citizens, called fermions, who reasonably obey Pauli’s principle.
In the other, bosons collide, an ugly gang of anarchists who have no respect for anything – at least for this principle, which means that they can be quietly in the same place at the same time.
As reported by the site (by the way, quite unusual) Particle Adventure Laboratory Berkeley, these bosons are divided, in turn, into two groups: the mesons we will not talk about here, and the "particles of force" of the boz, through which the main forces of nature and the cotor spread.
These bosons themselves, it should be emphasized, are not all such exotic beings as might be thought.
In fact, if you are able to read this chronicle, it is thanks to one incredibly banal boson: a photon, or "particle of light", which is the "courier" of electromagnetic force.
In fact, when a particle having an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "breaks" the electromagnetic field in this particular place, about like a stone thrown into the reservoir.
From this “disruption” comes an electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared radiation, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon – and hence one of the bosons of “force carriers”.
A more stable field.
The same goes for the Higgs boson, with the only difference that in order for that boson to appear, another field, the Higgs field, has to be "broken".
However, the Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, it is necessary to achieve very and very high energies, as if it were a frozen stump, the surface of which could only be heated by a very large stone.
That’s why a huge particle accelerator like the one that operates in CERN – the Big Adron Collider, which is a ring with a diameter of 27 km! – is needed to achieve such huge energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is also useful for explaining the relationship between the Higgs boson and the mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, interact, others - not: a sheet of paper, for example, will never be held in the refrigerator itself.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that interact have mass, while others (such as photons, by the way) do not.
So, what "can bring" all this research, Mrs. Plamondon asks?
In science, they are used to verify the correctness of the Standard Model (SM), and this also allows physicists to detect the difference between the results of observations and predictions of SM.
In addition, some of them are passionate about finding such a discrepancy, because the slightest inconsistency can open the door to “new physics” and close some of the Model holes.
The latter, it must be said, still has significant shortcomings, offering no explanation for gravity (oh!) or for dark matter, which forms about 80% of the universe (oh!).
However, no such differences have yet been found in the CERN.
Consequences
The benefits of these studies for the everyday life of the average person are more difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that there is no one.
See: In the early 1960s, the pioneers of laser research in Bell’s laboratories could not even guess what revolution their work would be.
They predicted their applications in science, but no more.
In fact, already deceased physicist Willard Boyle, who worked in the Bell Laboratories, where a laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the former were impulse) in 1962, said that the laser was originally considered a harbor rather than a harbor.
Just imagine...
In addition, the application can be found for the toolkit accompanying the study.
For example, the same William Boyle himself, during his optical research in 1969, developed a small light sensor.
This sensor, although not at all its original purpose, now serves as an “eye” for all digital cameras in the world and earned the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
This, of course, does not mean that the work of the Grand Adron Collider will necessarily change our lives, but it only shows, in fact, that everything can be.
Palliative care is the best way to die... <0x7C> "Long"
The Quebec Commission on Dignified Death has recently discussed the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate should resume soon, and at this time a bill is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this crucial area.
"Debt" tried to look more closely.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Monterrey.
The prostate cancer that destroyed him from within gave him a two-year delay.
“I was given five years, I lived seven,” he says, lying in a bed between life and death in the shelter for the palliative care of Victor Gadbua in Belay, where he arrived in the morning.
“But it’s always a shock, it’s impossible to prepare for it,” he says.
The disease does its job: an incredible weakness that does not allow you to go to the toilet on your own and even eat on your own.
Sitting at a table where there is an appetizing lunch, he gives up and agrees to help him eat.
He wakes up, even makes sense to smile, talk to strangers who work around him, bring him medicines, take him to the bathroom.
Courage before ordinary death.
“My greatest desire to be cured of diarrhea is humiliating,” he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found a cure for the disease.
“We are taught throughout life that a man must urinate standing,” says Pierre Broder, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbua shelter.
Regressing to the state of the child is an unbearable humiliation for some.
“It all depends on a person’s ability to tolerate depression,” he says.
Because, in the opinion of many people engaged in palliative care, important events occur in the very beginning of this decline.
Patients who enter the Victor-Gadbua palliative shelter are all cancer patients.
Forecasts give them a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses does not provide any more assistance called "treatment".
Ms. A., 89, is most afraid of dying "consciously of suffocation".
But the disease allowed me to know my children.
“I have good kids,” she adds.
“I don’t want anything in life anymore,” she says, before allowing her to wear a breathing mask.
She is still awaiting in the coming days the last visit of her son, who came from Italy.
In the Victor-Gadbua shelter with the help of a group of volunteers provide body care and nutrition assistance.
This is a palliative care that remains when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, for every 11,700 inhabitants, there is one place in palliative care facilities.
This is very little given that sooner or later we all die.
Life here continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christian Martel, one of the doctors of the shelter.
Whether it’s physical, emotional or mental comfort.
To the dying we will agree to provide oral rinsing from brandy or pepsi, whatever he asks.
Diabetics are no longer forced to control their sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we brought Mr. H.'s beer, which died tonight.
In the morning his son drank this beer in the legs of the deceased.
“We are helping our loved ones, as well as our patients,” says Natalie Savar, director of patient care.
At the Victor Gadbua shelter, no day is like the previous one.
Next to the 93-year-old, who enjoys his last meeting with his family in the yard, lying on his pillows during the toast in his honor, tragically dies a young 36-year-old surrounded by parents, wife and two young children, and to try everything.
“In the last six months from three to five cokes, they have always been busy with cancer patients under the age of 45,” says Dr. Christian Martel.
53% of patients admitted to the Victor-Gadbua shelter come from home, and 47% from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is estimated that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, to care that is provided to ease the suffering of patients who have entered the final stage of their lives, whether at home, hospital or in a shelter.
And some institutions, such as the Victor-Gadbua shelter and the Greater Montreal Palliative Care Society, are more or less exclusively specialized in the care of cancer patients.
It is this big gap in Quebec’s health care system that causes many doctors – specialists in palliative care – to fear the adoption of a law that legalizes euthanasia and aid in suicide.
Starting in October, a manifesto, signed by the lights in the field of palliative care, by Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lyapunta, circulates and demonstrates their disagreement with such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, Quebec’s health care system is not effective enough to ensure the right to high-quality palliative care before the transition to euthanasia is allowed.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who spent 14 days in an ambulance, in terrible pain, and no one took the necessary measures to ease them.
I'm afraid patients want to die just because they don't get adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists are trying to save patients until the last day, despite pessimistic forecasts.
The hopes for survival of Ellen Richard were already minimal when she stopped exhausting chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping treatment, she told me that she was sorry that I was stopping the fight.
She told me that my days are counting!
There is no all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who request death thank medical personnel for not fulfilling their request after the palliative care team eases their pain.
However, it should be noted that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the fight against pain.
According to Elsie Monroe, director of palliative care at the Palliative Care Society at the home of the Greater Montreal, patients are not susceptible to pain relief in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often resort to a palliative sedation, in which the patient sleeps until his death, either from time to time, or permanently.
We can no longer pretend that we do not know about these sufferings.
More and more often, patients who are unable to relieve pain will be able to access palliative sedation.
Patients who suffer from pain always say the same phrase: “I want to die.”
But it doesn’t necessarily mean “I want to have euthanasia,” it means “I want to make it easier for me.”
The creation of this reportage was made possible thanks to a journalistic grant from the Institute of Health Studies of Canada.
Large-scale Real Estate Scandals in Quebec
Officials responsible for the construction of roads, construction contractors, fundraisers of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia day after day tell what they know about the colossal "system" of the mazes, the construction industry, the prosecutors, the politicians.
The "Industry", which was very expensive to Quebec taxpayers, especially in 1990 and 2000.
“It’s curious how this system unfolds after all the funds have been put into action,” said Jacques Dusheno, a deputy and former Montreal police chief.
It was thanks to him that in 2011, the scandal broke out as a side-effect of the investigation of official crimes related to road construction contracts in Quebec, which the then-liberal prime minister, Jean-Charles, reluctantly agreed to.
The Ducheno Report established a direct link between industry, secret funding of political parties and corruption.
“Since the investigation began in 2010, only the Ministry of Transport would have saved a billion dollars on contracts,” he said, if some were to deter their instincts from taking their share.
The Charbonno Commission "has already displaced two mayors," he added, hoping that it will be able to "open the schemes behind the individual".
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit Established in 2011
The case was joined by the Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, which was established in 2011 and comprised of a large staff of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
And, in addition, the staff of the special unit "Molot", which after 2009 forced the "storm cartel" of Montreal to stop overvalued contracts.
Over the past few weeks, a series of searches have been carried out, and some municipal officials, including Frank Zampino and Richard Markot, the mayor of a small town, have been charged with fraud and corruption.
In turn, Jill Wayancourt, who recently resigned as mayor of Laval, the third largest city in Quebec province.
It is suspected of receiving multiple takeovers when placing public orders.
In addition, the official prosecution was filed with several Montreal communications service engineers and construction contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Akkurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter exploded the real bomb, investigating the "system" of receiving state contracts.
For several years, Zambito gave 3% of the value of contracts entered into in Montreal to a mafia-related broker who, in turn, transferred the money to Mayor Gerald Trump's party "United Montreal".
In the 2000s, Zambito raised more than <0x24>88,000 (about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>68,000) to various parties in the province, mainly the liberals who were in power at the time.
He also admitted that he had illegally raised funds for former Deputy Prime Minister Natalie Normando from the Liberal Party.
Sewerage contracts in which the value exceeded
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked relentlessly.
Gil Surprenan, a former civil construction engineer, described it in detail before the commission: in ten years he received gifts from construction firms, invitations to tours, golf tournaments, toys, toys, toys, toys, hockey games and toys36 in total.
Other officials in charge of the construction of roads admitted that they had received a leg, surpassing the bills by 30-40% with the help of fake supplements.
Then one of the mayor’s party organizers, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Trump of deliberately closing his eyes on the existence of a parallel budget that filled party cash registers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Trump resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a deep crisis.
Chantal Rulo was one of the first deputies in Montreal to be alarmed.
The mayor of Riviere de Prey County, east of the island, has been opposed to the sale since 2010 of a municipal plot bought for <0x24>5 million and resold for <0x24>1.6 million to builders at the expense of a construction boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
She says in the investigation, which will eventually be started, she will “draw a wire that allows us to understand the functioning of the ants-fighting system to stop gangrene and identify the culprits.”
This process is described as “painful but positive.”
We are in the process of cleansing the wound, but Montreal will need its own investigative team and observer to avoid the return of dubious practices.
How we clean up at home.
Regularly.
Jacques Dusheno, for his part, notes that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is particularly concerned about the role of "elective officials who knew about this scheme" but who were not involved in the fraud.
Considering that the share of dirty money in Quebec’s election campaign funding reaches 70%, he jokes: “I was told it was just a pale reflection of reality.”
The Quebec government is proposing to limit donations to <0x24>100 to parties, but, he said, will not change the situation: “Until we are strictly limiting election spending, there will be dirty money in politics.”
He called for a complete restructuring of the system of state contracts and party financing: “We cannot go down below; if we venture into the essence of things, we will be able to build a house on a more solid foundation, with better control and legitimacy.”
If this story casts a shadow on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Dusheno invites those who laugh to look into his own yard...
"It's not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you’ve gotten an extraordinary breakthrough in the PSG.
How would you explain this growth?
This may be due to individual consciousness, but it may also be due to a new dimension of PSA.
Great players have arrived.
I grow up with them every day.
The technical staff also brought a lot.
These factors make me raise the level of my game every day.
During the game, it’s easier.
In football, everything happens very quickly.
But I'm not burning.
From the very beginning in the center of pre-training at the NIF in Clermont-Ferrand and before my arrival in St. Etienne, I have always been a step forward.
Thus, you benefit from the competition established by Carlo Anchelotti...
This summer is not new to playing very high-level matches.
They also know that each exercise is very important.
This leads to the fact that a player like me wants to be on the level and get the most out of it.
In addition, Carlo Anchelotti supports my positioning.
He is assisted by deputies like Claude McLelee, who played in the same position as me.
Ancelotti is the owner of the position?
Yeah, sure.
Anchelotti pays tribute to all the technical staff.
Today in the First League he has no equals and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has extensive experience, and he has won many titles with high-class clubs.
He worked with great players.
I think he will bring new titles to Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
Then I left the whole series of injuries.
The trust he has in me also explains my achievements.
What do you think of the first part of the season?
In the First League, Lion took the lead.
But we're still ready.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we have effectively qualified in one of the eight finals.
What is the club’s goal in this tournament?
We'll try to go as far as possible.
Anything can be from now on.
We can say our word face-to-face with very good European teams.
We first want to finish first in our group, before Porto, to be able to accept a return match in an eighth final.
Will the PSG become a first-class European club in the short term?
He already has a budget for it.
In order to become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and consolidate positions in the long term.
That's not true today.
Financially, the PSG has the means to make this project real.
Not taking the title in the First League, as in last season, will be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year, we really want to win this championship title.
Last season we were close to that.
In May, there was a disappointment because we had everything to get to the finish first.
It was a very lucky season.
We finished it with 79 points.
As a rule, 79 points implies the title of champion.
But the other team, Montpellier, played an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think everything will be fine.
"Despite the fact that strong teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux have entered the championship, I think we have the strength to win.
Don’t you think the media expects too much from the PSG?
It’s normal to expect a lot from us, given how much has been invested and what players we have.
We're fully ready for that.
On the other hand, when we win 4-0 at home against Troy and we still find something to criticize, of course, it's a little annoying.
We ask ourselves what people expect from us in the first place.
We will never be able to win every weekend with a 4-0 score.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We are trying to implement the game project.
The team is formed over time.
We have proven in the Champions League that we can respond to modern challenges.
Look at Manchester United, who hasn’t been able to go into one of the eight finals for two seasons, though they’ve also spent a lot of money!
Given the amounts invested, we presented you with 15 points ahead of the winter break.
It would be a disrespect to our opponents and to the French Championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not at the top last season, were “awakened” by this new PSG.
This shows how exciting the First League is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and tell ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we have won.
PSG seems completely dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Well, what if they say there's some kind of "golden dependency"?
It just means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and he scores a lot of goals.
He came for it and he proves he's a First League star.
Everywhere he played, he showed that he was a great player and a world-class star.
In the group, we respect him as a person and as a player.
He also respects the people around him.
What he's done is really exceptional.
It also encourages others to improve their game.
Tiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates everyone to move forward.
How did you survive the Euro 2012 with France?
What a disappointment.
I really wanted to be part of this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from wasting a bit of playing time.
I saw a lot of things out there, and I got out of there stronger.
I’m able to play a good team game today.
This is what I had hoped for since my baptism with the Blues.
We have taken lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and now we need to be exemplary.
What do you think of the first months of Didier Desham in the Blues?
They are effective for him.
He has good positions in the selection team for the World Cup.
He’s a tough coach, he’s close to the players and he’s inspiring to win.
What Laura Blanc was like.
But I wouldn't like to compare.
Blan reached his goal, he qualified us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Desham will bring the Blues to Brazil.
A well-deserved draw (1-1) kicked out in Spain on October 16 is a fundamental match?
This game gave us confidence in ourselves.
Everybody was fighting for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, there were no such matches in my career.
Pay and sell without the help of banks – with Bitcoin
It is the complete opposite of the current exchange of money based on central banks, numbered transactions between the receiving parties c commission fees for their processing.
In addition, as is often the case with these technologies, there is an obvious political view: the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), is at the same time a virtual currency (but converted into dollars, euros...) and a protected BitTorrent exchange protocol that allows the exchange of files between participants of the same level.
Approximately 200,000 operations have already been registered with 15,000 computers on the network.
Several thousand sites accept bitcoins for donations or as a means of payment.
Bitcoin’s price, reaching a peak of <0x24>30 (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>23) in June 2011, fell to <0x24>2 five months later before returning to about <0x24>10 today (rates are listed on bitcoincharts.com).
There’s nothing special compared to the world’s exchange of real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its report on the virtual currency, published in October, was interested in this system.
He describes Bitcoin as “the most successful virtual currency,” “competitive with the dollar or the euro,” and “similar to conventional currencies.”
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as “credits” used to promote a video game, which are earned in the process of the game, or which can be purchased (and sometimes exchanged).
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
But the exchange operations are always controlled and processed by a central body.
In Bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously account holders, auditors, currency issuers, buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Any transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses, similar to an e-mail.
Only for each new payment can the user choose a different address, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information relating to this transaction is signed electronically using a dual-key encryption system.
The network can also verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is possible to check that the bitcoins used in the transaction actually exist in a public account that is sent across the network.
The key step is to register a new transaction in this book.
It goes through a mathematical solution sent to computers, which, like a temporary central bank, gets the privilege of adding this new line.
This is the hash phase of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a digital signature, short and unique.
Computers "take" a new transaction and add a number to it before "hacking" it all together.
The goal is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, other nodes can easily verify that it is correct.
The transaction thus turns out to be inextricably linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.
If, for the purpose of deception, the user very quickly (less than ten minutes) would like to pay twice for the same amount of money, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network - and the other would remain unconfirmed, as they have different electronic signatures.
The computer that solves the problem gets 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, the prize is regularly split in half, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are split to one hundred million, leaving an additional reserve.
The complexity of the task also increases with the increase in computing capacity.
The life of the network has already survived the rise and fall.
Sites offering Bitcoin services were attacked, and bitcoins were stolen from reserves.
“The defect used does not concern the protocol itself,” says Pierre Nuaz, who recently launched Paymium, a company that makes real money payments using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reported the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this deficiency.
Major players, such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept such donations.
Others, such as the WordPress blog platform, allow them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weitzman Institute in Israel analyzed the book and found that nearly 80% of bitcoins are out of circulation.
“Gigant Sales” was announced in November.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” says Jon Holmquist, who works at Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Nuaz, another author of the booklet on this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as an operating network.
Its system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) or contactless payment via a mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to verify transactions, which in this way comes out cheaper.
The owner better controls his personal data and can thus be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
It is enough to provide an address that can be “photographed and recognized” by the phone, Pierre Nuaz clarifies, ensuring that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general tendency to revise hierarchical systems in favor of more horizontal ones.
“Before Bitcoin is approved, it will take some time, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicted.
In its report, the ECB envisages, by the way, revising the various risks that are considered to be increased today in the event of the success of this system.
We're leaving Afghanistan.
What's next?
The French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Capsia and Suroba).
NATO and Americans are expected to follow them by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain control of its territory, and for the Afghans to choose their future, not just hoping for us.
We were mostly affected by Afghan peasants, whom we regarded as terrorists.
And we ourselves, with 88 soldiers killed, wounded and mutilated.
The Taliban is made up of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often of peasants who reject the presence of a foreign army, as it was with the USSR.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, let even jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks join them.
They are tolerated, sometimes helped by local insurgents, but they will no longer be as soon as the West becomes more delicate.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the heights of the hills planted by almond trees thanks to the French loans, went well.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles accompanied by helicopters reached Kabul, not being attacked.
Since the end of 2014, there will be no Taliban invasion of Kabul.
Circumstances have changed since their irresistible advancement from 1994 to 1996.
At the time, Kabul was empty, the country was in fire and blood because of the struggles between different groups.
Taking them under the control of the country was then perceived as a sort of liberation, a return to security.
Afghan women have been paid for the blackout of these peasants, in which they were surpassed by al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved even today.
The former Mojaheds, the Afghan Government and the present Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become dolls occupying state lands to resell them under construction to repatriants returning from Iran and Pakistan, using huge U.S. subcontracts.
They are discredited; most of them, by the way, did not even fight on their own.
People, as I've heard in the countryside, want a government that doesn't consist of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who succeeded in America’s generosity: an outflow of capital is significant.
Young people are tired of the war and its ideologies.
They lived in the modern world during exile in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated its benefits.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
The public schools in the cities are filled with both boys and girls.
It is necessary to provide jobs for these young people who do not want to return to the darkness of the old parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
Everyone, including armed fighters, loves mobile phones, TV and Turkish soap operas that represent the modern world and that are watched everywhere.
There is an army right now.
Will the authorities that will command her be considered legitimate?
The old commanders, leading the anti-Soviet struggle, are already taking steps to restore the provincial wives who would not submit to the central authority.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with strong local differences, must be to some extent decentralized, as Western countries do, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state with strong presidential power, removing the post of prime minister, which had existed since the 19th century.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country, starting in the 1950s, and even earlier, is dependent on foreign aid.
The industry has not been put on foot, no dam is working, no irrigation system has been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except vegetables and fruits.
Priority is given to a private initiative.
In a country devastated by the Thirty Years' War, state control of infrastructure would be necessary.
There are rumors that Afghanistan has a huge mineral wealth.
This only reinforced the feeling that Western countries were present there only to conquer them.
Without energy to process iron ore or copper on the ground, without means of transport to export them through the mountains, there is no mining of useful minerals.
The Chinese have almost left the copper field of Mes Aynaq, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to dig up a huge Buddhist complex and remain the province’s largest employers.
It is also necessary that one day Afghanistan and Pakistan, from which imports and exports are largely dependent, restore normal relations in the same way.
The withdrawal of the French combat units ended on November 20.
The new agreement on cooperation provides for the preservation of traditional assistance: a college for girls, for boys, a faculty of French at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields.
Since 2009, in the pursuit of "conquering hearts and minds" and performing the impossible task of combining aid with offensive operations, the service "military-civil activity" at the Ministry of Defence (Cimic) has been dismantled in 2012, with a small general organization.
These works, with the intense attraction of the local workforce, were able to help withhold the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, restoration of forests, fruit trees, protection of soil and increased area of fragrant land.
What will we leave in our memory after spending <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2 billion on military spending?
A much more modest budget would help to improve the living conditions of the local population, which are very harsh in these valleys, often located at an altitude of more than 2,000 meters above sea level.
The embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural works from local communities in the province of Capisa.
In order to get rid of the uprisings led by foreign groups, which the farmers want, as they told me, we need to provide them with a little non-military support that would be well controlled and would come directly to them.
Category: Heavyweights of the Constitution of Egypt
This is a risky new move by President Muhammad Mursi.
While Egypt is divided more than ever, on the issue of a constitutional declaration that temporarily gives it extraordinary powers, he decided to play a va-bank.
He said on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on the final text for the next day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State provided the Assembly with two additional months to complete the work.
Almost two years ago, Egypt relies on the preliminary text, which has been amended several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal contradictions.
This new initiative has only strengthened the division of the country.
According to his opponents, the President insists in his "autocratic deception", continuing to "viole this word" and "popping the right".
In the camp, his followers are confident that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis by accelerating the transition process.
The referendum must be held within fifteen days.
It is a very short period of time that causes the Brothers to give up their intention to explain the text to the Egyptians, article by article.
For the president, this is also a way to restore social and democratic legitimacy, while dissatisfaction is booming across the country.
Mohammad Morsi seems to be convinced that Egyptians will vote in favour, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Times.
Especially since the call for an accelerated vote is like an ultimatum for the Egyptian people: "Either you vote for my text, or I leave myself with extraordinary powers" which are supposed to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, mostly Islamists, voted for the text yesterday.
Most liberals did not respond to the challenge.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they knocked on the door, feeling unable to convey their opinion.
Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society have done the same.
In order for the necessary quorum to be reached, 11 people, the backup participants, were rushed to be added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising that in most cases the article was voted unanimously.
The commentators, by the way, entertained the fact that one of the few disagreements of the day arose around... time for prayer, as some members of the committee considered that the hours of the Constituent Assembly were incorrectly set.
The text, which was still in voting yesterday, consists of 234 articles.
The subject of general attention, article 2 ultimately remained an identical article of the 1971 Constitution, stating that "the principles of the Sharia are the main source of law".
Salafist parties, for whom the implementation of Islamic law is one of the main demands, hoped to replace "principles" with "rules", which would allow for their more stringent application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a testament to their goodwill and respect for other members of Egyptian society.
“Liberalism,” the liberals answer, who see only a piar in this.
Because, in their opinion, the islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
They refer in particular to article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular as regards the verification of the conformity of the Sharia law.
According to Egypt expert Sophia Pomier, this is alarming because “people who are called to make decisions are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.”
We can see the birth of theocracy.”
Many liberals, in addition, are upset by the fact that the next rector of this university seems to be far less moderate than the current.
“At the moment, there is no specific religious interference.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of civil law.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not vampires, but people with university education, some were trained in the French system,” says Alexis Bloe, who is preparing a dissertation on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he admits that "Article 220 may be ambiguous, since the terms used in it are borrowed from religious vocabulary.
This applies in particular to "fixes" [Islamic jurisprudence, - prem.].
And in the future, there may be a question of how competent civil judges are to make decisions about it.”
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is being criticized as it confers broad powers on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brothers claim that they have decreased considerably compared to what they were under the old regime.
Another point of contention: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the consideration of the defence budget will be held not in Parliament, but in the National Council of Defence.
The trial of civilians in military courts will also not be prohibited, despite requests from human rights associations.
The latter also expressed concern about the text, which they deem detrimental to freedom.
Responsibility for blasphemy has been retained, and insults are now prohibited, which can have serious consequences for freedom of speech, and especially for freedom of the press.
In addition, none of the articles talks about protecting women anymore, emphasizes Heba Moraeff, from Human Rights Watch.
The only positive point, she said, was the prohibition of torture in article 36.
A word that did not appear in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president was due to speak on television last night, the demonstrations are scheduled to take place this afternoon at noon.
Supporters of the head of state, in turn, will go to the streets on Saturday.
In Israel Ukrainian tourists await holy places, Pup Earth and sea from salt
The Promised Land combines the greatness of Bible truths, modern comfort and the originality of nature.
The AIF has outlined the five most important reasons for visiting Israel.
We worship the holy places.
It is worth a visit to the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that everyone who enters this “bath” is deprived of God’s grace.
And Galilee is the place of Jesus’ miracles: the conversion of water into wine at the wedding, walking on the water, calming the storm, and filling the nets.
Here Jesus appeared before the disciples and after the resurrection.
It is the most holy place in Jerusalem.
Believers here pass the Path of Suffering or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (Latin - Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the fortress of Antony, Pretorium, where there was a court, and along the streets of the Old City, it leads to the Temple of the Lord's Tomb on Mount Golgotha - to the place of the Cross, the Stone of the Ointment, and the burial place of Jesus.
Here is the symbolic Christian Pope of the Earth, symbolizing the salvation of humanity.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem will be erected at the place where, according to Christian legend, the tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus grew.
Jerusalem also has the most holy place for the Jews - the Wall of Cry, which remains from the temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
Traditionally, people of different confessions leave here notes with wishes that are then fulfilled.
Making a trip through the vertical
The ruins of the fortress of Massada remained from a secret refuge from enemies, which Herod the Great built in 25 BC for his family.
They are located on suspended rocks in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
And only those who are passionate about climbing can reach them by their own path.
The rest to this historic summit is carried by a cable car elevator.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous ski resort Hermon, on which in the winter months - a huge influx of tourists.
From the foot of the mountain there is a shuttle bus.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to ancient tradition, there were supposedly pagan gods on the top of the mountain.
Visiting Unique Museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You don't go to all for one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are worth visiting.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near the Knesset (Parliament).
It contains the oldest Quranic manuscripts, or Dead Sea scrolls, found in the caves of the Jewish desert, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
Also worth a visit to the Museum of Art in Tel Aviv.
His exhibition presents extensively the paintings of Impressionists and Expressionists Mone, Pissarro, Renoir, Cezanne, Sislea, Matisse, Modiliani, Shagala, Picasso.
In Akko you can visit the Al Basha Museum, which is a number of halls of ancient Turkish baths with the mullahs of visitors and bathers of the time.
In Caesaria you should go to the unique private Rally Museum, where you can admire the sculptures of Dali and Roden.
There are no tour guides and souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are not categorically accepted.
The fifth, the Museum of the Holocaust or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells about one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic section – the children’s memorial – was built in memory of 1.5 million children destroyed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter it, and you find yourself in absolute darkness.
Meaning of the stars.
And there are the names of the children of the Jews and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Healing
The three main resort areas of Israel are located on the coasts of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Sea.
Each of them has swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Interestingly, in the Red Sea they bathe even in the winter months, as the water temperature there does not fall below 21 degrees of heat, and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and there they bathe all year round.
By the way, it’s the most unusual sea in the world is at the lowest point on the planet – 417 m below ocean level.
The laser water in it is salt, which easily keeps floating even those who are not able to swim at all.
The landscapes around are unbelievably beautiful.
They come here to undergo a course of treatment with the use of salt water - rapes, and healing dirt, and to cure health for dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, to bring in order the broken nerves.
Touching the Secrets of Antiquity
They are stored in the ancient part of Tel Aviv, the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
It passed through the famous Sea Route, connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to legends, it was here that Noah built his ark, and Perseus saved the beauty of Andromeda, with whom they lived a long and happy life.
Tourists love to wander through the narrow streets, named after the signs of the zodiac.
They say if you look at the walls on the street of your sign, Fortune will be a favor.
In Jaffa you can meet newlyweds coming from all over Israel and even other countries for a photo session.
And in Caesaria - the city of the king Herod - it is possible to walk through the Roman theater, "to take" the fortress of the crusaders.
In the Roman period, Caesar was the capital of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theater is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourist on the note
Going to Israel, don’t worry about your imperfect English: in the country about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
The money in the trip is better not to take in euros, but in dollars, which are easy to exchange for shekels (now <0x24>1 - 3.8 shekels).
Urban transport is mostly buses, but in Jerusalem there is a high-speed tram, and in Haifa is the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and connecting the city of Lower to Upper.
Actually, it's an underground funicular.
A ride in all forms of urban transport costs 6 shekels, for which you can drive with transfers within 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is observed on the Sabbath.
From Friday evening until sunset on Saturday, markets, shops, public transport stop working.
On Sunday morning, the working week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels - only cosmetic food, excluding pork, seafood, fish without cheese and dishes, which combine milk with meat.
There offer a large selection of dishes from lamb and beef, soups and desserts cooked on coconut milk, traditional Jewish pasta humus, a variety of sauces, balls from hammered nuts - falalel, fruits and vegetables.
There are no dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
But there are a lot of fed cats that "walk on their own" in exchange.
In the evening they can be seen sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
Morlyns love crowded places and do not give up on the invitations.
Car rental, depending on the brand, will cost from <0x24>37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus insurance - <0x24>15 per day.
And renting a bike will cost 15 shekels. per day.
Tickets in the museum cost an average of 30 shekels.
Language of numerals
In 2012, Israel was visited by more than three million tourists from around the world.
The most important ones to travel and relax were the citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists visited the Promised Land from January to October 2012, which is 51% more than the same figure for 2010, until the visa cancellation on February 9, 2011.
"The Great and the Powerful" will bring to Moscow: Migrants copy money to the language
While MPs and human rights defenders argue that there will be a law on compulsory language testing, fraudsters already appeared in the country, trading "default" certificates
Every year, 13 million passengers travel to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are Central Asian citizens: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make money to support families who are left at home.
From 1 December, the law entered into force, according to which every working migrant will be obliged to pass the exam on the knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the field of services, housing and utility, housing and retail.
However, over time, the FMS promises, tests will become mandatory for all visitors.
At the same time, you will have to give up not only the language, but also the Russian history, and the basis of the legislation.
Language skills will need to be confirmed both for obtaining and for extending work permits.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is the national language.
They are not subject to the law and people who managed to obtain certificates and diplomas of education before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Benefits, convictions and protection of rights
The network of exam points will work under the auspices of the Russian-language Institute of Pushkin, the University of Friendship of Peoples, MGU, SPbGU and other Russian universities.
Migrants will be able to pass tests in all cities; more than 160 such centers have already opened in Russia.
The initiative on the introduction of testing was supported both by the State Duma and FMS deputies.
But human rights defenders, before the law came into force, have been able to ask the press many times the question: what exactly will this give?
What will change the obligation of knowledge of the language for both the Russians and the foreigners themselves?
First of all, - the representatives of the migration service answer - this will reduce the number of people suffering from "working slavery".
Very many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, explains the head of the FMS mission of Russia in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organized recruitment system will allow 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise in unprofessional, educational, non-language migrants who do not have a medical certificate.
Without understanding the language, the future migrant is doomed to encounter unfaithful people, who, in the form of help, will move him "sitting" into a terrible narrow barracks, where he and dozens of his likes will spend months without food and documents, whipping at 12 o'clock.
We receive a lot of complaints from our migrants.
"On their homeland they promise one thing, and on arrival they are cheated, they pick out a passport, they do not pay the promised salary," - confirms the head of the Directorate-General of Labor Migration of the Ministry of Tajikistan Tolib Sharipov.
Don't worry, settler!
However, while many citizens of the Central Asian republics, who are going to earn money in Russia, admit that not only do they not know the language of the country they seek, but also write in their own hard.
Of course, it’s not so much their fault, it’s the trouble: a few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to even get an impulsive primary education.
After all, their families have nothing even to feed the children, not to mention to dress them properly, to dress and to equip them in school.
When they reach their adolescence, they are sent to earnings as soon as possible.
It’s hard to say if you know the language badly.
“You feel humiliated and incomplete.”
However, with regard to the language law, human rights defenders note one important point.
Testing will only be carried out for those migrants who have legal status.
If there is no status, there will be no exam or subsequent official work.
In the meantime, most of the tourists still live illegally in Russia.
"Welcome, or External Entrance Banned"
Many of the foreigners claim that obtaining official status in our country is not so easy.
The reason is in bureaucratic prepositions and all the same linguistic difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But a fake registration can be done quickly and only for a thousand and a half.
The officers of the Russian police know that we have mostly fake documents, no registration, hence cases of extortion.
"One hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," Umed Huschadamov, a Tajik citizen, told reporters.
"Come on, don't paint, buy a painting"
On the first day of the entry into force of the language law it became clear that not only migrant registration documents were fake.
Several "lip" certificates for passing language tests have already been taken away by FMS employees.
Fake papers are printed on a conventional color printer.
Of course, they did not get new owners: each of the migrants, hoping in this way to facilitate themselves the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is twice as expensive as the official testing procedure: it will cost a labour migrant <0x24>3,000.
The main task in the near future is to protect the system from corruption so that “shorts” cannot be simply bought, both the authorities and human rights defenders agree.
While the authorities can promise guests who have not been able to successfully pass the test for the first time, time to study the basic language course.
In addition, a non-Russian speaker will be offered work in areas that do not involve active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not take on illegal arms market
The proportion of crimes involving the use of legal weapons is very low
Russia’s Interior Ministry is proposing to tighten the law on civilian arms holders.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: Shooting at weddings, when there were no casualties, and slaughter, organized by Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, which resulted in the deaths of seven people.
Police want to ban the wearing of trauma in public places and increase the age from which you can get a license for weapons - from 18 to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Security and Anti-Corruption Committee, Irina Yarovaya, and promised that amendments to the Arms Act would be introduced to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy that the Russian authorities are trying to tackle the problem by "turning the hakes".
An open letter appeared on the network, the authors of which - representatives of various public small-scale organizations - are demanding to give up "unreasonable tightening".
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, according to the Russian BBC service, criminal lawyer Vasily Lesnikov.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, in the six months of 2012, there were 142 firearm crimes registered in the internal affairs bodies, while only 1168,000 were recorded in the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that the tightening of the legislation in the field of civil weapons does not force the criminal to go to the "black" market.
Now, according to them, you can find any weapons at a low price in Moscow.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior claims to control the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The "black" arms market is replenished through several channels.
The main five such channels, says the resigned colonel Viktor Baranets, who has worked for ten years in the structure of the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of the site that accepts arms orders
The first is the "military or military footprint", that is, the weapon that was stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves have carried the weapon," Baranets said.
The next type of "black weapon" - stolen by criminals from representatives of the power structures.
Baranets explains that there are both those who have been stolen from police warehouses and those who have been stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
Illegal “stamps” go on sale from military warehouses.
In many warehouses, explosions were frequent.
"There are proven versions that some of the fires were made specifically - to cover up the shortage," the former military officer said.
According to Barantz, their leaf is imported by weapons manufacturers.
“We are now producing private arms factories that are not able to withstand competition in the international market and are throwing weapons from under the floor to the black market, including Moscow,” the expert says.
Another source of the “black” market is smuggling.
Weapons and rifles from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan, are particularly common.
“There is a production, sometimes a shrub, and a mafia was formed, which organized the flow,” explains the former military.
Where did the gun come from?
The experts calculated the approximate share of each of the sources of illegal arms supplies to the “black” market.
This report was prepared in 2011 by the Center for Problem Analysis and Governmental Management Design.
The specialists analyzed the reports of the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, the criminological literature and open data portals on the topic of arms.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, researchers write, come from the army and the forces.
Half of all weapons in the black market were found there “in the fault of officials whose work is related to weapons,” the report said.
According to the researchers, 17% of cases of weapons come from places of armed conflict, in 14% of cases there are robberies at the stage of arms production, 5% are from "black archaeology".
The salesman-consultant of one of the arms stores, who asked not to name his name, assures that the weapons found by black digs, no one has been buying for a long time - too old.
Most often, as he says, after a new party, sellers go to the military warehouse.
Through the flag, a person buys a unit, such as a TT gun.
It is printed, transmitted through the shutter.
“He transports it to the city and here he sells 900 euros for a piece with two stores,” he says.
“It’s true, the police are aware of all the cases, so periodically when the crime discovery plan burns, they conduct control purchases from illegal arms dealers,” the consultant adds.
"Like in a luxury store"
The seller and the buyer often find each other through acquaintances.
I looked at the sites, in the blogs, until a friend responded, who offered to come to the platform "God" where there will be a person who will take me to the "angle" where we will trade.
I only knew the price of the tree there.
Military Inspector Viktor Baranets
To get the trunk, I need a familiar who has a way out, says the sales consultant. - I have such a familiar, but I'm not sure about it.
There are sellers in the markets, but you also have to come, on condition, "from Ivan Ivanovich, who asked to pass on that tooth to his daughter."
I'm even getting a couple of tapes right now through a man I'm sure of.
He's just delivering them to me because he knows I won't.
Newbies are looking for weapons in different ways.
Ex-military Viktor Baranets tried himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was preparing to publish an article about it.
The schemes, he said, have not changed.
He was given an album with photos where there was "everything".
“I felt like I was in a luxury store,” recalls a military man.
The buyer, according to Barantz, is not offered a cat in a bag - everything can be tried.
I, a potential customer, don't just buy - we go with the seller to the forest, there we set a target.
“They give me the opportunity to shoot, and when I’m sure the weapon hits well, we start trading,” the expert describes the procedure.
Sofa shop
Internet search engines refer to websites and groups in Vkontakte, where they offer to buy weapons "for different purposes".
This does not require any documents or personal meetings.
“It’s enough to have a certain amount of money,” the ad cap reads on the website “Buy a gun or machine gun.”
On it, users leave their applications and ask questions.
Will they sell to minors?
"Without a license, of course," - asks the user "Ivan" (orthography saved).
"Kupju TT.Moscow" - laconically formulates the request "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has now deployed a huge network of base sites and those wishing to buy combat weapons with a ribbon blade.
People walk like hungry fish on feed, and then extract coal in Siberia
Military Inspector and Former Military Victor Baranets
I have heard of such schemes: usually the site is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People are accepting orders.
The buyer makes a payment through an ATM.
"In response, they send a photo and an instruction where the weapons are hidden," said Dmitry Kislow, a press secretary of the public organization "The right to arms".
Viktor Baranets claims that by leaving the application on the site, you can be left without weapons and get behind the grid.
The Federal Security Service has now deployed a huge network of base sites and those wishing to buy combat weapons with a ribbon blade.
“People walk like a hungry fish on feed, and then they extract coal in Siberia,” he says.
Makarov for <0x24>100
When buying illegal small arms, according to experts, you can deposit between <0x24>100 and <0x24>900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the organization "Right to Weapons", Makarov's gun can be purchased for <0x24>100-300.
We'll have to wait a month and a half.
It is unloaded from long-term storage warehouses by the guide of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to official statistics of the ministry, compared to January-October 2011, the number of such crimes in general in Russia decreased by 7% and amounted to 22.9 thousand, and the number of identified facts of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosive devices 7 percent.
U.S. fast food workers and supermarkets
Working at McDonald's accounts account for up to a quarter of all American teenagers
In recent days, there has been a wave of protests against low wages in Walmart’s universities and restaurants in popular fast food networks such as McDonald’s, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy’s and Kentucky’s.
Until no one predicts whether this wave will turn into the ninth axis or is destined to rest in the early stages.
The shares are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing public organizations.
In addition to raising the modest salaries that Walmart employees and the fast-food system receive, the goal of protesters is to create trade unions in them.
So far, this sector of the economy is barely covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
Shares began last week, after Thanksgiving, on the so-called "Black Friday", when a cheap sale orgy broke out in America, capturing millions of residents and sometimes accompanied by slippages.
On this day, some employees of Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their jobs and, together with trade unions and left-wing activists, kicked off the store of the company, whose goods are intended for people of modest and medium size.
Walmart sells everything in the world, from diamonds, hunting guns and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That’s why many low-paid Walmart employees only work at home.
The availability and range of products made Walmart one of America’s largest corporations.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell the goods cheaper in part because it pays little to its employees.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, for example, the lack of trucks or manual scanners.
Participants in Black Friday’s shares demanded an increase in their salary and estimated that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation had jumped from <0x24>30 to <0x24>100 a month.
A typical Walmart employee, who earns <0x24>9.5 an hour, this spending is not in his pocket, they said.
Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley prove that if Walmart raises its average salary to <0x24>12 an hour, it will cost the corporation <0x24>3.2 billion.
That’s about 1.1% more than she’s currently spending on wages.
If Walmart completely shifts the pay rise to buyers’ shoulders, then every visit to the store will cost them just 46 cents more.
In a year, they will spend about <0x24>12.39 more than they are now.
Walmart supporters note quite well that the protests took place in only nine states and did not injure corporations at all.
"Black Friday" continued in its stores from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the next day, and during this time Walmart sold about 5,000 goods per second.
In total, her cash registers made almost 100 million transactions on "Black Friday".
A spokesman for the company, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview with the left-wing Huffington Post that “less than five” Walmart employees had left jobs in total, and that the protest campaign was just “another piano trick.”
"Free cash!"
Protests continued this week in New York, where they were not targeted by Walmart (they’re not complaining in this progressive city, and therefore they’re not here yet), and McDonald’s and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says he sells billions of servings, and then he doesn't even give you hospitals and he doesn't pay you for honest work!
Jumaine Williams, member of the New York City Council
At the moment, the minimum wage, according to federal and New York law, is <0x24>7.25 per hour.
Fast-food restaurants increase it over time, but not so much, and on average, their regular workers get <0x24>8.90 an hour in New York City.
No one earns less in this expensive city.
How to live in New York for such money is impossible for me.
Once upon a time, nearly a quarter of American teens walked through the McDonald’s, who ate behind their counters after school, while living with their parents.
Few people have seen the main source of food or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now I’m constantly faced with interviews with McDonald’s employees who complain that they have to live on this salary and sometimes even feed their children on it.
On the other hand, the Wall Street Journal forum has a comment, whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know what you will feed them for.
Participants in the protest, which began at 6.30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonald's 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and fast-food cooks start paying at least <0x24>15 per hour, which is more than doubled.
They also called for the creation of trade unions in the field of fast food.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from obstructing and punishing union activists with whistleblowers and dismissals.
On the other hand, the administration seldom makes their lives easier.
But to include fast food in the union is difficult and for objective reasons.
One of the main ones is the unusual flow of personnel.
Disagree
Noisy protests took place on this day and at a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action was in the middle of the day at a McDonald's rally next to Times Square, at which a number of local democrat politicians, in particular, a member of the council, Jumain Williams, did not pay you the bill, and said "McDonald's" for the job, and that he sold the laundry.
Protesters were supported by other prominent New York Democrats, such as City Mayor Bill De Blasio, who said that "we must join in support of fast food workers in order to achieve fair pay and economic well-being."
As described by the New York Times, it was the largest action of its kind in the history of the American fast food sector.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, and not all of them were workers of a fast-paced society, which employed tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is not yet clear whether this spark will generate a flame of mass movement.
"While the brain is tricked, it's average."
Popular among fans of modern technology theme of augmented reality has recently been adopted mainly through the prism of special lenses.
Initially, at its annual conference, Google showed the current model, and then in November it became known that the application for the corresponding patent was also submitted by Microsoft.
However, from a conversation with the head of a group of interactive 3D technologies at the Cambridge Laboratory Microsoft Sharam Izadi, it follows that for the scientists of this company, the glasses are a stage.
Their manifold perspective of manipulation of virtual objects in the air with bare hands, creating virtual open spaces.
- Please tell me, in general, what is your research team doing?
We are engaged in human interaction with machines, but at the same time we are trying to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
While humanity in the mass is stuck in the stage of working with pixels on a flat screen, sometimes ticks in them with a finger.
We want to look forward to 5-10 years and predict the fundamental changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect, because everyone is interested in gesture management.
- What else is ahead of us?
“Despite the fact that Kinect has moved the interaction on a physical level, a lot still happens on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The information input has improved (the system gets more data), and the output is not very much.
We are trying to change this, working on truly three-dimensional display systems based on various technologies, including projective ones.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world, to make it more perceptible.
To do this, however, you need to recognize not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we will be able to complement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
And, first of all, these stupid headsets of virtual reality!
What do you think about voice control?
It’s a popular thing, but isn’t it overestimated?
- It can definitely not be called a panacea - the question of privacy arises, because you do not always want to inform the surroundings about their actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of interactions with computers are good, but each in its niche.
For example, for the management of devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not about sparrows, but about such expensive, short ones.
At the same time, the gestures were taken not by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet, which recorded the movements of bones and muscles.
While it is large, it can theoretically be reduced to the size of the watch.
But in general, the future of a mixed type of management, for example, gesture<0x2B>voice.
- How's that?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this gaseous bank on to you?
You will say it and show it at the same time.
- I usually just say it.
- Oh, it's gonna be very hard to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt to what the machine may or may not at the moment?
- It's not necessary, but it's mutual convergence.
I think that in the near future we will mainly have to work on the development of new types of sensors that will allow us to more accurately determine human reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, they give a good resolution in depth, this is very important.
- Speaking of your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your claims to modern cameras?
Is there a lack of resolution, depth, or something else?
In principle, the present generation is something that can be detracted from in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get megapixels 8 at a speed of 1000 rpm.
But it is not in the megapixels themselves, but as a matrix and depth.
From the last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us - this adds work to the designers of algorithms.
That is to remember not only the resolution on the X and Y axis, but also Z.
Speed is also very important, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the current 30 rpm is frankly small, especially for gestures.
Steven Betishes of our Redmond Laboratory made a touch sensor with adjustable processing delay - from 1 to 100 ms, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) indicator.
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction between a person and a machine.
I would be very good at doing the equivalent of such a device, only that does not require touch so that the frames per second are larger.
Do you need to increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other a receiver of the reflected signal.
The third camera is, in fact, an ordinary sensor of the visible range.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Possibly more cameras could solve the problem.
Or worsen it by increasing the required amount of calculations.
It would be great to create a flexible Kinect analogue, play with the camera’s curve position, and see how this will help in three-dimensional positioning.
As far as I can remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Don’t you think that in terms of everyday use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, rolling around all the time, holding a smartphone in your raised hands is not very convenient, but this is what I think: the coolest option would be "transient" augmented reality, when on the basis of a cloud platform you could switch from glasses to a smartphone and a dictionary.
Glasses are a very personal device, in this their strength (private things you only see), and at the same time weakness - augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
Let’s imagine for a moment that manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to a simple mortal.
There is one problem that critics of this idea often point to: there is no tactile response!
Your hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your team prepare for this challenge?
In my lectures, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in human-machine interaction.
I think the eighth might be the addition of tactile sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the interesting tricks is to use the second hand as a kind of mat for the image.
It's a great recording of clicks!
But there are also technologies that are actually aimed at giving these "images in the air" visibility - for example, the interference of several directional ultrasound rays at a certain point where the finger is located, gives a bit of a feeling, but so far it's very weak - as if you're underestimating it.
There are also bracelets on the wrist that affect the nerve endings in the fingers - also a promising direction.
- Did you try to fool the brain?
To make him think that he feels what he should feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried to do that.
Here lies another task, which has to be fought for a long time - how to force a person, physically in very limited space, to believe that he is going on open, almost infinite - we also work on the concepts of slopes of runways (not quite like those in the cage).
While deceiving the brain gets on average, work is still very much for many years.
This is what makes working on virtual reality so appealing to the researcher – many things are in an absolutely initial state.
Taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
“Rosbalt” continues the project “Petersburg avant-garde”, dedicated to the citizens who are at the forefront, at the forefront of culture and art.
This top list has already included bright artists of the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe, passing all-Russian fame.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the epic artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller - a bearded man, dressed in all red, which is found at the Russian Museum, at the Summer Garden, at fashionable tours and vernissas.
Kirill Miller’s paintings are always gathering crowds of spectators wherever they are exhibited.
Cyril Miller is one of the strictly St. Petersburg socio-philosophical storytellers, creators of new mythologies.
Cyril Miller is a bright man of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80s - early 90s.
In addition, he is a man of the city, with his appearance on the streets causing a smile to the citizens, raising everyone’s mood.
Recently he took the charmer into his hands and became a St. Petersburg charmer, as he matured for this complex role with all his bohemian existence, philosophy and image.
Cyril, why are you still walking around the city in all red, not in yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the red color as a modeler who deals with the view and the image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the artist, the image maker and society.
Although everything that is a little bit gray in society, it causes aggression and arousing a bad trait.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate.
When did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At the exhibition in the DK Nevsky, where my works were exhibited.
I realized that this was my way.
Then the wave of old free unofficial artists passed, and new, free-types of me were incomprehensible.
I became friends with the artists of the new wave, with the post-gas storm that led to the Pushkin-10, and there was no more wave.
He throws me in theater, clothes, music, in all genres, except the word.
It was important for me to feel at the center of the culture of St. Petersburg, where all the best creative forces must be gathered.
In 1995, I took over the territory at Pushkinskaya-10, and there, while there was no repair, there was a music and artistic club, a bohemian club, the house of the St. Petersburg bohemian.
Many were born there: we, Tequila-jazz, I remember how the string brought with the project "Echo Van Gogh".
The string and his friends sang light songs under the banner, they were in a tight knit, among them was the now fashionable composer Igor Vdovin.
When the band played live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg was the leader of many programs until the Halifax era.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and his great career went, and he received basic education and education from us.
Gallery "D 137", club "Griboedov" is the corners of the Art-Clinic.
That’s where our employees and our employees have gone.
I'm a hero of the last century when culture meant something.
In 2000, the poll was in the press, the award was "The People of Our City".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" was called me, my culmination ended.
In the new times it is uncomfortable to work by old rules, I am a person of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In our years it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are shared, you can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your work has a recognizable way of doing it.
"Many of my paintings are hits, they have a distinctive relevance and sharpness.
I'm going to have a program exhibition, "Russian Museum in Clowns".
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be social, and being like that now is painful and scary.
But in the clowns, everything is blurred, tragedy is removed.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world through totalitarian disguise in a fairy tale.
Now the clothes are met, focusing on the external mechanics, not on the inner person.
Or maybe you can't give him a hand, and you need to sprinkle it in the cornea.
And the deception will be removed with the help of a change of clothes.
- And recently we saw you as a city charmer. - A cultural city must have such a hero.
Who else, besides me, they are.
Is it possible that commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now the commercial art should be clean, tactical, sweet.
Disintegration of cultures.
Previously, people crashed into the room, the bohemian loved one, the simpler one.
Now everyone has broken into micro-communities, now it’s hard to like everyone.
I'm not a 100-dollar paper to everyone like.
Now you have to think about who you're gonna like.
Now every cult hero has 100 fans.
- And Stas Mikhailov comes for a few thousand!
- He's got tossing, there's the sex-social sphere working.
And on the cultural ground 300 people will come, and 10 thousand will not come, and in the end, less management, money, everything will fade.
I have fans, the main thing is not to fool them, not to ruin the barefoot.
When I was young, I wrote such paintings that a collector had them hanging on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with the paintings that usually end up.
Concepts are often confused.
They say: culture is spiritual, culture of consumption.
There is no culture of consumption, it is from another opera.
I was a man of yesterday’s culture, raised by the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, who gave up money for painting.
I'm for that culture.
- Kirill, what's missing from St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is a concept: an official from culture.
But not all of them can do culture.
With the right tsars, things were not so, the tsars may not have understood much in culture, but they understood that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
We have good consultants in Moscow.
We have people in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they’re backwards, because we need higher experts who will properly evaluate these experts and give them a path.
The tasting is now flourishing.
The same Erart, but they are distinguished by the fact that they honestly say that not all modern art we accept, there are artists who have to look for other museums.
- What's up with you, St. Petersburg?
- St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital, in Moscow culture is much more, there is soil.
On our stones, art is difficult to grow.
We need cultural ground, and we have more writers now than readers, that’s wrong.
There are a lot of curious people in Europe who go to exhibitions, concerts.
We have a thin layer.
We need to make fashion art as it was at the beginning of the last century.
Project implemented with the funds of the St. Petersburg Grant
Born in Space
The earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with landers on board are going to search for a spare planet.
In order to preserve humanity, the main question arises: how can we continue our race in a state of indifference or on the same planet?
I think the choice is small.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be conquered hypothetically.
"It's Venus and Mars," said Vladimir Surdin, a senior scientist at the State Astronomical Institute named P.K. Sternberg.
But if the conditions on Mars are more suitable for life, then on the surface of Venus - temperatures of 500 degrees.
You can only live at a high altitude or orbit of Venus... in space.
Approaching the issues of reproduction in space began with the flora.
Half a century ago, experiments were conducted on plants.
The four generations of the orbital cucumber were no different from their terrestrial varieties.
Then - removal into orbit of insects, tiny fruit flies drosophile.
In 1979, eggs were sent to space to check how the embryo develops under weightless conditions.
We get at the exit of a completely normal bird.
And then the problem begins.
“The problem is that this bird has to find resistance, he has to get up on his legs and start moving,” explains Vladimir Sychev, head of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems (IMBP) Laboratory.
Unable to find the resistance, the chickens cooked in orderly.
And 10 hours later, the newborns had a complete atrophy of instincts.
The birds did not react to the light and sound.
And the trouble was that after four days they just died.
"And twice we have sniffed out chickens, then we refused, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," - notes the failure of the experiment with chickens in space Vladimir Sychev.
With animals, the last time a biological "minic" flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013 the experiments will continue.
However, on the biospatial "Bion" there will be only same-sex individuals.
There was an experiment with rats that were sent into space already with fruit.
In principle, nothing supernatural has been found there.
"It was just on biosatellites, but again - it is a single experiment, and such research needs to be carried out," - notes Vladimir Sychev.
After the landing of space rats, a offspring appeared.
But approaching the problem of reproduction directly in space is not yet successful.
It's a difficult task.
Animals, losing their usual habitat, simply cannot realize their sexual instincts.
Unlike animals, human beings, in principle, may.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, and is able to create a similar emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not conducted.
Women have been in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was for Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing that humanity has is a female organism.
Our Chaika flew, and no one on Earth could say if it would survive after flying into space.
Will she be able to give birth to a baby after this flight?
“No one has answered this question,” said Wahtang Wakzandze, a veteran of the rocket and space industry.
In June 1964, just a year after the flight into space, the first female astronaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child, Andriyan Nikolaev, was also a astronaut.
In 1988, the second female astronaut Svetlana Savitskaya, twice in orbit and even in open space, was born a son.
However, the risk remains.
We have few, units are numbered by astronauts, who have had everything after long flights, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if more, it is dangerous even in orbital flights," - summarized the pilot-cosmonaut, Hero of the Soviet Union, Hero of Russia Valery Polakov.
Yet, humanity needs to look for some new pathways in biotechnology, protection from radiation, creation of artificial gravity.
The CPC Hydrolaboratory is a mandatory stage of flight preparation.
Here, under the conditions of zero floatability, astronauts develop the skills of working in open space.
Water mimics weightlessness.
If for adults, water is comfortable, but still a foreign environment, then for breast-feeding children - the nature.
Little ittiands seem to confirm that life on land has come out of the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months in the mother's fertile fluid, it is easier for him to get used to the hydrogen then.
In principle, this is logical because from the moment of birth, from the moment of the first bath, it is only 2 weeks.
“It’s very little to forget about,” says coach Marina Aksenova.
In other words, if for a born child weightlessness is a more natural state, then for a woman - gravity is necessary, the force of gravity.
Very quickly in weightlessness, the muscles of the abdomen, pelvis, decrease the ability to push the fetus.
All right, let's drop this too, relying on stimulants for childbirth.
You can, of course, go to a special chamber for birth, she will push him out.
"And what else?" - asks non-trivial questions Valery Polakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling terrestrial attraction, the body will not form a skeleton and muscle system.
A newborn in orbit is impossible, as an adult, to wear a special loading suit for training.
He will simply be deprived of what he will need.
"And this experiment, which we will go to with you, by allowing the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to the fact that we will bring to Earth a disabled person, a completely disadapted person," - predicts the head of the IMBP bioethics committee RAN Igor Pestov.
The birth of children in space is a matter of theory.
However, after a while, this will be a reality when the earthmen on their ships go to a distant planet that will be home to their offspring born in space.
Chief of the Chief Control and Audit Office: Checking the Schwartz system failed on the fault of politicians.
In the public procurement sector, the Czech Republic has good oversight bodies and, despite the presence of quality legislation, is delayed in its application.
This is the statement of Miroslav Kala, Vice President of the Supreme Control and Audit Administration, from an interview for the site Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
“The law will never be perfect, but it should be applied correctly, which I think we lack,” Kala said.
Such conclusions are provided by a joint inspection of the Czech and German supervisory authorities.
As an example of wrong practice, Peter Nechas’ approach to the so-called Schwartz system is taken.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the GDP (Civil Democratic Party) will not bother entrepreneurs with checks - is this out of order or allowed?
“The law should be established in some way, and if it prohibits something, then the Prime Minister cannot resist the work of the institutions that are used in the duty of verifying and enforcing commitments,” Kala notes.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you discussed a joint draft between the Czech and German parties, in which the legislation on public procurement of both countries was compared.
What was it specifically about?
I mean the parallel check that we started, probably two years ago.
To put it simply, the fact that European legislation endorses the way public procurement should be conducted is followed by national legislation and then also in practice.
All the information has been collected and, even in the case of an incomplete verification, interesting differences have been found - in other words, the legislation we have can be "accurate and in error-free", but in practice we are submissive to Germany by some parameters.
It follows that it is not enough to create more and more precise rules, it is necessary to focus on the application of the law itself.
And how can this project help you, what does it mean to you?
It is this kind of joint control that can contribute to efforts to clarify laws, reduce and improve restrictions, because this does not lead to a positive result.
Economics means getting the right thing at a reasonable (but not always low) price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behavior.
But it is not the fact that we will achieve this by reducing the limit on orders.
It is possible that this system will be filled with “papers” so that those who want to find gaps in this system will find them much easier than if the restriction had not been reduced.
You are talking about the internal problems of the practical application of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there such an organization as our CRU (Control and Audit Management) or does it work differently?
As far as institutions are concerned, there is a Bundesrechnungshof, which is organized according to our principle, and there is also a collegium that operates slightly differently, but basically both institutions operate the same way.
In addition, the powers are to some extent similar, but since Germany has a federal structure, there are audit units at the level of the federal lands - in this their system is somewhat different from ours.
BRH can only manage federal money, we have state funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are monitored at the level of the federal chambers of accounting.
When it comes to local legislation, is it easier than we do?
In general, I wouldn’t like to compare without specific data, but in some respects Germany can be sampled, but it can’t be said that it’s better at all.
Is it because they do better with control?
Definitely not, but I’ll repeat, I don’t like comparisons like that.
But it must be said that even exemplary countries face many problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't get any benefit from working with our office, would they?
Speaking of domestic legislation, how did the amendment to the Public Procurement Act affect your institution, the consequences in some way manifest?
Given that the legal force of these amendments is quite short, it has not yet appeared in our control work.
Since we are monitoring the fact, some delays need to be taken into account.
We take this into account only in the process of preparing future checks - we started using our new tool "detection of the risk of non-economy", through which we expelled almost 14,000 state contracts. We analyzed them. There, of course, these changes will be shown in such types, because the terms and conditions of change change change.
Do you think the adoption of this law will bring a benefit or additional burden to the system of bureaucracy?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that can arise is that the rules will “harden” and it will be impossible to follow them.
With the operation of the previous rules, the supervised enterprises are linked to the supplier (e.g., regional operational programmes - with the regional council) in that any non-compliance with the law on public procurement means a violation of budgetary discipline.
Should the law be tightened in this way?
I don't think that's the way.
The system should exclude those who want to capture and abuse, but not punish those who make a formal mistake that does not affect the decision.
Such a system will only create even more pressure on bureaucracy.
And how to get out of this situation?
Let us realize that this path will not lead anywhere.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that GDP will not disturb entrepreneurs by checking the so-called Schwartz system. What does that mean?
The "Schwarz System" banned or allowed?
The law should be established in any way and, if it prohibits something, the Prime Minister cannot oppose the work of the bodies which are obliged to verify and enforce obligations.
You can say, "We're going to change this law and fix it," but you can't say that we're going to pretend nothing's going on.
The Public Procurement Act contains quite strict rules as and what should be formally carried out, and this is correct. This will protect public procurement.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic when the candidate with the best offer is disqualified only because of formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it should be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, is lacking.
The roads are slippery, but mostly passable.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and snowed.
They’re mostly passable, but somewhere with more caution.
Karlovy Vary
This morning in the Karlovy Vary region, roads were crossed, but somewhere frozen and snowed.
The temperature dropped from five to ten degrees below zero, but should warm slightly during the day.
Snowfall in the region has ceased, only a small layer lies in the lowlands.
However, on the hills of the Mine Mountains lies about 30 centimeters of snow.
From information obtained from regional road workers, it became known that the places had lower visibility due to the mist.
The R6 highway and first-class roads in the region are currently running without restrictions.
However, attention is needed, for example, on bridges where the surface can be frozen and slippery.
Also, all roads belonging to the second and third grades, including mountain routes, are passable.
But in some of their areas there are still remnants of frozen and snow driven places.
Particular attention should be paid to roads located on the highlands.
Pardubice and Královegrad region
The Czech Highways and Highways Administration on its web pages informs that some roads in eastern Czechia are threatened by glaciers, and on mountain roads and highways, there may be a covered layer of snow.
Regional road workers warn drivers of ice caps, which can be formed especially in the highlands of the Pardubice region.
Holocaust can be around Lanshcroon, Usti-nad-Orlicci, Pollichka, Svitawi or High Mito especially on second and third-class roads.
The roads I/43 and I/34, located at Svitavi, were treated with chemicals.
Especially snow lies on the roads of Krkonos and the Orly Mountains.
The covered layer of snow is on the roads located on the highlands in the areas of Rihnov-nad-Kneznov and Trutnov.
In the Czech Republic today there is a variable cloud without precipitation.
Temperatures typically vary in the range of minus three to plus one degree Celsius, light wind.
Pilsen County
The roads in the Plze<0xC5><0x88> region are passing this morning, but the places need to be cautious and adapt to the weather.
In the morning it is frozen, the temperature fluctuates from three to nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and subsequent cooling in some places can be slippery.
In places drivers may encounter fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
The information was provided by regional road workers.
The D5 road is now practically unrestricted, however, road drivers recommend to be cautious between 80 and 131 kilometers.
Most first-class roads have a dry and frozen surface.
In southern Plzna and Tahoe can reach frozen areas.
The second and third-class roads are wet, and also in this case there is a warning regarding the possibility of sliding areas.
Drivers should be cautious, especially on few used roads in the Shumava area.
Olomouc County
Drivers heading for the highlands of Olomouc region must take into account snowfall on the road today.
It remained after the use of chemicals in the Red Mountain Seat and on the road in the direction of Videlsk<0xC3><0xBD> Kr<0xC5><0xA1>ij.
At night, the snow forced road workers to go out on the street, according to information from the road management, in Shumperk about three centimeters of snow fell.
In other areas of the roadside, we usually pass without restrictions.
"On the elevations of Schumperk lies the remains of snow.
Drivers heading towards Esenik should take into account the presence of snowfall in the Red Mountain Seat,” the manager of the Shumperk Road Administration, <0xC4><0x8C>AN (Czech News Agency), said today.
During the night, their colleagues from Esenik made sure that the roads on the highlands after chemical treatment remained naked and wet.
In Olomouc the roads are crossed without restrictions, but in Sternberg drivers should be careful in forest areas where humidity is still retained.
U<0xC5><0xA1>tetski kraj, Liberec kraj
This morning, road workers from northern Bohemia reported that there were a few difficult places to pass.
According to information from the police database, in addition to several places with ice or snow falling, a mountainous road was closed on the site from the Telnice at the clinic in the U<0xC5><0xA1>tecka region.
Also, the temperature remains negative in the lowlands, so there is snow and ice on the roads. In the lowlands, especially to the southeast of the Czech Middle Mountains, on the contrary, there are no problems, the roads are mostly dry.
Complications on the roads have not yet been reported.
Road workers report the emergence of ice cubes in the vicinity of the Damage.
According to meteorologists, ideal conditions were created for its formation at night - all day went rain and cast snow, at night the sky became clear and frost started.
Unfavourable conditions are reported on the main road and on the I/13 on the border between the U<0xC5><0xA1>tek and Liberec region.
Due to the curved under the snow layer, branches of trees affecting the road itself were forced to close the road in Telnice on Kninice.
Simon Ornest: At concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
What do you think is the end of the world in less than a month?
This is just one of the many worrying news that we humans are so easily getting to.
Together with The Tap Tap, we are constantly joking about this and saying that we are the only group in the world that can accumulate enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December you are going to give absolutely unique three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you tell the readers more about it?
This is a national fundraising event that we have been planning for two years now.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the Maya calendar, which was announced on December 21 at 11:10.
On the day before this event, on December 20, at 21:00 in parallel, three concerts will start in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end, roughly speaking, at the moment when on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, whose time zone 12 hours earlier than we have, the May calendar will end.
Who came to mind with this idea?
At first it was my idea, then we all made up together with our artist Gonzalez Augusto.
In addition to the fact that we want to accumulate enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think together with the public about the state of the world we will someday pass on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the May calendar, we created a unique collection of items from shoes, t-shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world. These items can be purchased on www.e-tap.cz and thus also provide us with support.
The Tap Tap group, along with other musicians, also performed the anthem against the end of the world, which is called "The End of the World Cancels".
Will your favorite YouTube listeners hear the anthem at these beneficent concerts?
Of course, in the end, if in the end everything works and the end of the world does not come.
It is sold by all performers at all concerts at the same time.
The hymns will also be broadcast simultaneously on Czech television.
The words to this song were written and played the role of Jesus in the video Thomas Ganak, also involved in the performance of Xindl X...
How did you start cooperating with them?
We also cooperate with other people of Czech cultural life, as we hold many charitable events and concerts.
We are trying to actively connect them to these projects.
It turned out that many people like to work with us, they are interesting.
What will the revenue from the concert go to the end of the world?
On the purchase of equipment for the barrier-free educational center STUDEO, for the sixth year we have been working with the civil association Tap at the institute of Edli<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
Teachers regularly visit the school students of the Edli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute and hold fun and interesting events with them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to the teachers, and we try to provide them with this opportunity.
As part of the project of additional construction of the Edli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute in the future will be a separate building, to which we will move with this project.
There will be several music groups and performers at each concert.
What were the criteria for selection?
We have been trying to create a program that is of interest to all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bart, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Irji Suhi.
All details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any such “big events” in the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the festival "Prazhskaya Spring" and here, of course, we will prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would be happy to perform at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, if we are in the US, would very much like to perform in Washington and Chicago.
You have serious plans abroad, you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap group is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you deal with the road in terms of organization and logistics??
It's not as scary as it seems at first glance.
We have five participants on electric wheelchairs, their wheelchairs should travel in the luggage compartment, plus a large amount of cargo and tool boxes.
However, as long as we managed to do this without any problems. Czech airline <0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways have always been excellently prepared for us, which surprised me many times.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, everything went smoothly.
With trips abroad, you can compare different countries in terms of accessibility, public relations with people with disabilities and so on.
What have you faced up to now?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries, where everything works better than we do, in Russia we have witnessed that the East is still at the base level.
Compared to Prague, there are many barriers in Moscow, and there is still in the wild the autonomous movement of a person on an electric wheelchair in the center of the city.
There are also no banal things like giving up the road to a disabled person in an elevator.
Fortunately, there are already public organizations that are trying to draw people’s attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
What, on the contrary, should we constantly reach advanced countries?
There are a lot of things whose level of performance is far behind.
But it is important to clarify that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the efforts of the people affected.
In London and Madrid, it is quite normal for people with severe disabilities to move on their own in the streets, to go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere.
It is not very common that a large number of people with disabilities are actively involved in public life, in this we are a little ahead of them with The Tap Tap!
Respect for the public or accessibility is one thing, but the moment we get to know famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, then everything will really start to change.
So far these are individual cases - people with strong will.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but let’s go back two years ago, what made you organize it in 1998?
I joined the Edli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute as an educator, there were a lot of young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I am a musician myself and play on the saxophone, I organized an interesting musical circle with my colleague.
Well, over time, as our leader Lady Angelovich says, it's a little out of control (laughs).
Is it only popularity in recent years, or am I confused?
That’s true, it helped us that we started joining the famous singers and actively working on the group’s propaganda.
We have come to the conclusion that work that no one can evaluate is actually as if it does not exist.
Thanks to the funds of the European Union, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on.
Have you ever had the chance to play The Tap Tap so well?
From the beginning, I felt their potential to be able to do something extraordinary.
The show business is full of things that mimic each other.
It makes sense, everything new is taken with caution, and it lasts a long time.
There are very few rare things, but I dare to say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us, of course, is sadness, naturally.
But this grief is absolutely superfluous, because people with disabilities are not some suffering and all the abandoned personalities that we have to regret.
They are people who can live a full life and evolve, of course, only on the condition that they have the necessary resources.
I’m saying that if people with disabilities do something, it’s a shift not only for them, but for society as a whole.
Has success been ensured by the fact that you are a strict leader, as many consider you to be?
If we want to do the work in a quality way, we must be uncompromising in many ways and maintain a certain discipline.
But I think it's normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic performance and fly in the clouds, and when they learn that twice a week they have to go to rehearsals, attend preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But that’s what happens in any group that wants to work and achieve something.
Currently, twenty people are part of the band The Tap Tap.
How many were there in the beginning of 1998?
There's only one Lady Angelovich.
We're an open group, people come and go, it's impossible to prevent.
For those who have the will and the power of will, our doors are always open.
It will take place one day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21.00.
The concert will take place in Prague at Incheba Stadium, in Brno - at Club Fléda and Ostrava - in the center of Plynojem with the participation of 12 bands and other Czech musicians.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are connected by telemost at the time of performing the band's song The Tap Tap "The End of the World is Cancelled".
The aim of this project is to raise funding in the amount of SEK 25 million for the purchase of multifunctional barrier-free equipment for the STUDEO educational center at the Edli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute in Prague.
Tickets for the concert cost 400 kroner, for children up to 12 years of age entry is free. Tickets can be purchased in advance at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and Space.
Last week, at the ministerial meeting of the European Space Agency, Poland was accepted as the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as the second country from the countries of the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ECA on 12 September 2008).
Poland began a close cooperation with ECA in 1994 and participated actively in a number of projects of the Agency in the following years.
But Poland’s journey into space began much earlier.
Even before World War II, Polish enthusiasts were engaged in space flights, but this was not always met with understanding.
I recall, for example, the lecture by A. Sternfeld, who on December 6, 1933 presented at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory an idea from his innovative work "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
The ideas of the young engineer (1905) left the audience indifferent, after several years Sternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomsky was interested in his work.
In 1934, in France, Sternfeld won the Robert Esso-Peltry and Andre Luis Hirsch Award for Introduction to Cosmonautics.
Dr. Yan Gadomsky (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later became a great propagandist of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote a number of books devoted to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomsky became a world-famous propagandist of spacecraft, and his contribution was appreciated including the fact that one of the craters on the reverse side of the moon was named in his honor.
Already in 1925 in Poland a railroad was built, equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea remains unknown, as well as the details of the project.
It is not even clear whether a rocket should have been used to dismantle or brake the truck.
The information about this treachery is known only from the press of that era.
Since 1933, Polish artillery began to think about rocket shots.
The study was carried out by the Arms Engineering Section in cooperation with the professors Mechislav Wolfke and Gustav Mokzhitsky.
From the remaining materials, it can be seen that the studies have reached the stage of practical trials.
But with the arrival of the German troops the work was interrupted.
In 1937 the idea of a photoelectric fighter missile, proposed by the engineer Rogozinsky, appeared in the specialized printing press, and the following year the work "Air torpedo missile and aerial bomb" by the author Leliva-Khivoblok.
Both projects were developed for military use of rocket engines.
Before the war, all projects of military use of missile technology were undertaken by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated all the work.
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the work was completed due to the beginning of the war.
The next scientific work, dedicated to cosmonautics, appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautcyce).
The first mention of society is made in the November issue of 1954 of the journal "Problems", which publishes four volume articles on astronautics.
In one of them, Professor M. Subotovich proposed to organize a society that will be engaged in cosmonautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects were already making turnover, and it was clear that space research was a promising industry.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Society of Astronautics (POA) has been trying to join the International Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951), and already in the autumn of the POA became its actual member.
And the following year, the first Chairman of the POA Kazimezh Zarankevich (1902-1959) became the Vice-President of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He remained in this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the POA has made a significant contribution to the development of the very successful meteorological rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The missile, capable of overcoming the distance of 1800 m, was about 80 cm long and weighed less than 5 kg.
An improved version of the RM-1A was subsequently built, and in the summer of 1959 a two-stage RM-2 missile was tested in the Bled desert.
The rocket was about 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
The next version of the missile was already able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 missile could exceed 14.5 km, and its task was to observe the high wind.
But in 1962, further development was suspended.
The successor of the first RM-type rockets was the Meteor-1, developed between 1962 and 1965.
The missile was designed as a two-step, its total length was 510 cm, and its initial weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (designated as Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed which differed in the size of the camera for scientific equipment.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a space volume of 0.4 l, Meteor-1V - 0.34 l, and Meteor-1C - 0.62 l.
The maximum flight range for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Aviation Institute developed a Meteor-2 rocket, and its first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket with a start-up weight of 380 kg was able to lift a payload of 10 kg at a height of about 60 km.
Later, the Meteor-2N and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also worth mentioning Poland's accession to COSPAR (Committee on Space Studies) in 1960 and the establishment of the COSPAR National Committee two years later.
In addition, as part of the Intercosmos program, Poland participated in space research on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslav Germashevsky became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
Repealing the Public Works Act is not a solution to the problem.
Last week, the Constitutional Court overturned the Public Works Act.
The decision sparked a lively debate in society.
Without a doubt, it will be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
The liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU, as well as in the globalized world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In essence, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other.
This is due to the principle of free trade and free, unrestricted movement of private capital along with unbridled financial speculation.
As a result of a significant difference in the cost of labor (payment) there is a price tension.
Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the condition when the manufacturer, by delivering cheap goods, tries to stand in economic competition by "decreasing" the value of the competitor in order to take on the greater part of the market and thus increase its own income.
On a massive scale, for most entrepreneurs, this means either transferring production overseas, cheap purchases overseas, or disappearance. As a result, unemployment increases in those countries where the cost of labour is high compared to others.
Since private capital bears no social responsibility, including for the unemployment it produces, the inevitable expenditures of the state on social needs are increasing.
Overall, the situation is heightened by the unwillingness of employers to pay taxes and thereby compensate for the social economic and social damage they incur in pursuit of profits.
The situation is so well known that it is not necessary to provide specific statistics.
The unprecedented methods of private capital create at the level of the economies of individual states a situation where governments are forced to compete with each other to artificially reduce the social level of their population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments give their own population to arbitrary private capital, despite social decline.
This is primarily reflected in the amendments to the current legislation.
The aim is to economically force its people to submit to the dictatorship of private capital, especially in the field of wages.
It acts as a system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment and at the same time serves as a tool for cutting the rights of workers in the field of labour law.
As a result, the level of poverty increases, and at the same time the difference between the poor and the rich.
For several years there has been a public distribution of food to the poor, who are unable to feed themselves by their own labor.
The number of these people is already approaching a million.
As part of the increase in competitiveness of the German economy, there are constantly cases where employed people receive such a salary that the state has to pay them in order to get a living minimum.
Such a scandal has become known to the public and in the case of additional employees of the Bundestag.
Economic measures in virtually all the southern states of the EU undoubtedly lead to the same condition in which people under the pressure of a catastrophic decline in social status are forced to either emigrate to the common land, as it was in the 19th century, or to exist to the poor.
I wonder, however, where does it come from?
If capital comes from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, as the Chinese, Hindu, Brazilian, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians, Africans still work for a share of European wages.
This applies to all of Latin America.
The liberal theory and the media before nausea argue that the state cannot participate in the capital of its own economy, that the managed economy leads to an economic catastrophe.
Private capital insists that the state should not interfere with the governing actions in the economy.
Next, the question should be answered: is private capital, now practically governing politics and the whole state, not working for its own selfish purposes?
The unambiguous answer is yes.
Evidence is the existence of almost all-powerful and omnipresent lobbies in all states.
As a result, we have a futile situation in corruption, mutual benefit, in legislation where almost everyone deserves punishment but is not a crime.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, the situation is such that the state ministries, due to a lack of funds, commission the development of bills to private law firms that are closely related to the industry.
These bills are then approved by the Bundestag.
All power comes not from the people, as the constitution of the Western type says, but from financially powerful groups that prefer their own interests.
It is obvious that liberal-oriented democracy is now quickly in a situation as described by Appian in the work "The Crisis of the Roman Empire in the days of Caesar and Pompey": "The state has long been disintegrating, and the departments are engaged in violence.
Taken, illegally obtaining graces with stones and swords.
It is only a matter of fact that corruption and corruption flourished without any prohibitions, and that the people went to the elections with a pre-sold voice"... the orderly people were not at all ballotted to the position of the ruler, but at the end of the day, the state was one thing, that was left without the consulate for eight months. ..
As in ancient times, in modern society, selfless interests prevail without regard to the public interests.
Private capital in itself is no longer intended for use for public purposes.
The present result is no different from the past: the unprecedented decline of the elite without any effort to undertake deeper reforms.
So we must look for the cause of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the reckless liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
To date, the absence of these regimes and the existence of a liberal type of democracy can be seen as a certain pause, after which the next round is expected.
First of all, it is tragic that the present elite completely ignores the consequences for the hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, the humanitarian and social disasters that we are already witnessing, along with the crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and the new.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a decision, or at least not forever.
Under the pressure of competition at both the international and national and European levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is of a systemic nature.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the state's participation in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the governance of the state and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society in favor of the state.
Israel: The Laboratory of Chaos.
"Nothing will ever come out of violence, and it will never come out" - Sting, the song "Frozen", where the main verse of the refrain is the words: "we don't forget how fragile we are."
“If my sons hadn’t wanted wars, they wouldn’t have been.” – Died Gutel Schnapper, the wife of Mayor Amschel Rothschild.
The last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, has sparked many responses.
Some argue for Israel, arguing his position that it has the right to self-defense, and the Palestinians act as terrorists, others support the Palestinians, arguing this with the racism of the Israeli state, the terrorist state committed against the Palestinian Arab states, the Palestinian Arabs, and the Palestinians.
I do not want to think about who in these periodically repeated waves of murder is a criminal, and who is the victim, after all, today’s Israeli citizens, including self-governing territories, were born at the time of the current political situation, and were not witnesses to the beginning of the violence.
My goal is to invite readers to look behind the curtain, to look at who is primarily serving the 95-year-old tension (as of the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in a small part of the Middle East.
Some of my arguments are backed up by historical facts, some of them are drawn from my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is first and foremost the history of the struggle for power.
In every era we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether these people always took their own steps on their own, or if there was someone behind their throne who guided their actions towards their intended goals.
It should be assumed that we live in a time when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of several people, and that this concentration of money and the power derived from it could not have happened in the lives of one generation.
Among the astronomically rich families, there is one that could be considered the head of the sprout (I don’t know if anyone stands above them, but this is not excluded) – the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Sure.
The first news agency (Reuters) they bought as early as the 90s of the 19th century to stop rumors linking their name to criminal acts in the higher spheres in which they were in the shadows, and which have always led to the strengthening of their power, time, and wealth.
They have large stockpiles in almost all the world's central banks, and against countries in whose central banks they do not have their shares, they are conducting or preparing a war (before the invasion of Afghanistan there was only 7 bankers of their own time, after the invasion of Iraq there were 5 countries of Kafi after the overthrow).
Anybody who tried to resist this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to retain the status of a central bank for the Rothschild Bank of America, during the Civil War he began to issue his own (government) money and was killed in 1865 at the theatre.
John F. Kennedy began to issue his own money and wanted to cancel the FED (Federal Reserve System), was killed in 1963. Deputy Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the FED for unleashing the Great Economic Crisis in 1929.
Their thirst for world power from 1859 to 1871 led to the development of a plan of three world wars created by the great 33rd level Mason Albert Pyke.
The task of the first war was not to destroy the monarchical states in Europe, the second was to destroy colonial rule, especially the United Kingdom, and the third should lead to a reduction in the world population of about 0.5-1 billion people (their number of slaves).
The method by which a group of the wealthiest families headed by the Rothschilds works is a crisis challenge and a subsequent proposal of solutions (order ab chao – order from chaos).
But these decisions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see FED’s grounds, which should have prevented a recurrence of the crisis they caused in 1907).
Thus, after they were able to unleash the First World War by killing the Habsburg heir of the Austro-Hungarian throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed Tsarist Russia, beginning the Bolshevik Revolution.
The First World War ended with a sudden, unfounded military and economic capitulation of Germany (there was no longer a need for war to destroy Tsarist Russia) and, as a result, the breakdown of the Central European Power, Austria-Hungary.
In order to facilitate the dissolution of the Second World War, the bankers and politicians created a hidden conflict situation, imposing huge military repairs on Germany, which created a precondition for the radicalization of the poorer masses, and then it was only enough to leave the Germans to the poor.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds provoked the foundation of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historic Judah with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour Declaration created a precondition for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, the first clashes with the local Arab population began.
The terrorist attacks occurred on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, it is difficult to assess whether Hitler was removed from the chains in which he was originally held by the bankers, or everything he did was planned, in any case the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the preconditions for the recognition of the state.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, just as Germany was provoked by military repairs to World War II, the State of Israel was proclaimed to create a third-placed war.
If international bankers manage to unleash it, the Jewish people, as in World War II, will be the victim of combat on the front line, now together with the Arab or, more simply, the Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of trouble and chaos not only within the country, but also at the international level (to take only the sharp division of people into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is to blame and who is to be the victim of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where insults cause insult in the endless chain of violence, if it all began with the greed of individuals and their aspirations to world power?
Here it is necessary to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers train people to vote exclusively for their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, Yashrib Netanyahu, is also a typical example of a fascist, loyal international banker politician, who is doing everything to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran’s membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, will be a part of the whole (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.)
In what light are now the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: “All we need is a common crisis, and people will accept a new world order.”
The new world order in their representation is the world of lords and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves a pot of financial aristocracy enjoying comfort.
A world where every organism born at birth is implanted with a chip, with which it becomes a being under total control.
“And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to have a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, so that a man may not have a mark on his forehead or on his hand,
This is wisdom: anyone who has understanding can calculate the number of beasts.
For it is the number of a man, and his number is six hundred and sixty-six.
"Operation Argo": When It's Worse, Call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of Islamist students captured the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and hostaged 52 diplomats.
They were to be released in exchange for the overthrown chess player Mohammed Reza Pehlevi, who fled after the US revolution, who had been the patron of his regime for decades.
The U.S. administration did not expect a positive outcome of the situation - it could not afford to throw the chess offboard, because it could fundamentally undermine the trust of allies in other countries.
However, to achieve the liberation of hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was not able to.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later reinforced by a failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
The detainees were finally released after 444 days of negotiations with the Algerian government.
Their fate provoked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian moods.
The defeat in Iran greatly contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, which ended with the election of Ronald Reagan.
The film, directed by actor Ben Affleck, "Operation Argo" describes one of the episodes of the story that brought America small victories.
Shortly before the occupation of the embassy, six workers managed to escape.
After difficult periods, they completed their journey at the Canadian Embassy’s residence.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, while helped by an extravagant cover-up legend, according to which they travelled through Canadian passports as members of the filming group who searched for a place in the country for epic-scientific footage.
Combination of genres
The plan, invented by evacuation expert Tony Mendes, demanded Hollywood’s cooperation.
In order for the legend to be credible, specialized magazines wrote about the film's project, organized press conferences, the fictional production company had a real office.
Details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, a film based on Tony Mendes’ memoirs.
The film Affleck is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a real political thriller, the so-called "film-kinoopus", a story of successful interest, affairs - may be an example of a series of films about the friends of Austen.
The moods in the film are constantly changing - on the one hand, documentary scenes from Tehran (the titles show marked historical photographs of events and how the same situations were demonstrated in the film - there are no big differences in this).
On the other hand, lighter Hollywood fragments, intersecting with irony and moderate exaggeration.
And then scenes from the headquarters of the CIA and other institutions - men in costumes discuss the situation behind the negotiating tables, on the staircases of the institutions, on the phone ...
Ben Affleck did a great job of restarting his career.
From the ridiculous actor became a respected director, and his play ceased to be the object of ridicule.
"Operation Argo" is his third full-length film, after dark detective "Goodbye, baby, goodbye" (2007) and thriller "City" (2010).
At the same time, this is Affleck’s first film not filmed in the director’s hometown, Boston.
The feeling of the atmosphere of the place, at the same time, refers to the qualities that the director’s earlier films have elevated above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck shows it in Argo, where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place on the streets, with the reconstruction of real events - the opening scenes of the embassy's fall are impressed by its clarity, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and unpredictability that arise when the story changes suddenly.
Affleck and his colleagues achieve a similar effect in the scenes of the fictional (fake headquarters in Tehran’s bazaar).
Too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the story does not imply many exciting scenes of cinematic significance.
He is quite successful working with this little, sometimes thinking something - there it all comes out not so elegant (a scene in which a phone call in America prevents an imminent crisis at Tehran airport, and the pursuit of a landing area).
The disadvantage of "Argo" is the distraction associated with the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman in the role of Hollywood colleagues are really very charming, but their characters would deserve more space, and they are far from the only ones in the film.
Affleck’s film lacks a bit of dramatism, it’s a film that can be watched with moderate interest, assessing the performance and retro style, recreating the thrillers of the 1970s.
But it's hard to catch.
However, this is enough to remind us of one, still in a known sense of living history, as well as to testify how exaggerated the notion of all-powerful and all-knowing intelligence services are.
Rules of inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The portal www.bankonipoplatky.com, which conducts an annual survey on the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to announce a competition for "the most absurd decision or project from the EU workshop".
“We were moved to this last event, in which the EU plans to adopt a 40 percent quota for women in the administration of major European companies,” said Patrick Nager, the organizer of the survey.
Among the absurdities already proposed for the nomination was the recent decision of the European Court of Justice on the consolidation of the rate of insurance contributions for men and women.
So far, women have had life insurance benefits because for insurance companies they are objectively less at risk.
“The other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be put forward by people to the competition by the end of this year.
The vote will only take place until the end of February 2013,” Nager said.
The EU's controversial provisions include, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to the fuel, which results in harm to nature, as well as the prohibition of the use of reliable mercury gauges only because they contain a relatively small number of hazardous substances for the poultry, the poultry, or the omer.
Also criticised was the actual ban on the use of the term "butterbread oil" or the withdrawal from the sale of classic lamps.
The quality bananas should be 14 centimeters long.
The pan-European apparatus often takes a decision under the pressure of some commercial or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels are usually protected by any state or group of states (in this way the Czech Republic now defends the claims of its banks even under the threat of veto).
The interests of the lobby are as follows: for example, top-quality bananas in the European Union should have reached a length of 14 cm and did not dare to show an “anomalous curvature”.
At the same time, the European Commission was justified in harmonising only the existing differentiated national rules that complicated trade.
The EU, despite the resistance of some countries, has still softened the standards on fruit and vegetables, referring to the fact that existing directives will lead to product depletion.
A candidate for a win in the poll may also become a last year’s EU decree that the air balloons sold must be provided with a warning that children under the age of eight cannot inflate them without adult supervision.
The EU appealed to US research that balloons during play are a potential cause of death of children through suffocation.
Such a restriction now applies to children under the age of 14, who are prohibited from diving in fair duels.
Funny ideas are born at home.
It is also absurd that the rule that applies to the European officials themselves is: anyone who has any official position in the EU cannot, given the delicacy of the subject for Greece, use the name of Macedonia, but should instead say "BYURM" (Byvskyy).
The portal Bankovnípoplatky.com, in cooperation with the association of liberal economists "The Principle of Non-Interference" (Laissez Faire), proposed for voting, in addition to a few of the above-mentioned absurd rules, for example, the EU rule on the volume of pet foodstuffs.
The EU has set the maximum amount of food stocks that may be in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of its accession to the European Union.
Subsequently, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the established volumes of canned mushrooms, for which it was threatened with a large fine.
The organizers of the questionnaire were also interested in the idea of paying some countries that they did not have a sea, and the idea of granting subsidies for a grant application.
But these ideas came about in Prague, not in Brussels.
"We're in a disadvantage because we don't have a sea.
We will ask the European Union for compensation," said the then Minister of Agriculture, Yaroslav Palas, in the autumn of 2004.
As an argument, he pointed out that there was a high grain yield in the country, and as a result of so-called intervention procurement, the State had full stockpiles that had to be exported.
For the fact that the Czech Republic is far from the ports, the EU, according to Palas, should have paid us hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission went to the Czech Republic, organising a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Subsidies for obtaining subsidies were offered to the villages by the Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel German (US-DEU), in particular, such subsidies had to go to the preparation of an application for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Strange Provisions are an exception
While decisions in the Member States are easily criticized, EU efforts to regulate, as well as to improve the functioning and development of the European Union, according to many experts, deserve more recognition.
A serious problem, according to experts, is the acquisition of EU grants for projects that do not even have an indication of something in common with deepening European integration, but which Member States achieved in the discussion of the budget.
It creates emotion among the Czechs and the fact that, as in other countries of the European Union, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to specific identification of its traditional products, and it does not always win in this competition.
Although the Czechs, after six years of fighting with the Germans and the Austrians, retained the name "Olomouc cheeses", however the "Tusemian Roma", whose traditions in our country are rooted in the 19th century, our producers were to be renamed "Tusemak".
Only products from grape distillate, not from sugar beet, can be called rum.
In the official list of EU-registered products, along with the world-famous "feta" and "gorgondzola" raw materials, marzipan from German Lübeck or Parma winery, have already been found, for example, Karlovy Vary, Gorjelick and Trsheboni karp.
The EU trademark can also be proud of the Pardubice spicy and gorjitsky pipes.
“People want me to protect the republic, but I’m a fan,” Okamura said.
Mr. Senator, how does one come to mind to run for president?
I don’t want to be a senator or president.
If everything in our country worked without any problems, I wouldn’t have balloted anywhere.
But I can no longer see the country unfolding in the last 20 years, robbers collide here, people raise taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don’t like, I try to find a way to change it.
And since I’m forty years old and I’m an independent person who doesn’t belong to any party, I have no choice but to influence things as a senator or president.
You got into the Senate, but soon you went to the presidential castle.
Do you not turn your back on the people who chose you?
I've always said that I'll join the fight for the presidential castle depending on the outcome of the Senate election.
I later clarified that if I was elected a senator, I would run for president.
My goal is not a position, it is a tool by which I can carry out my views.
That's why I need the greatest influence and the broadest powers.
But the difficulty is not only that we as a nation are inherited in our bar or TV, but at the same time are willing to smash anyone who tries to change something.
Added to this are the media, which denounce a person, and which confuse freedom of speech with freedom of lies.
For example, I was told that I was paying bribes to journalists, or that I was an adviser to Irgi Paroubek.
Let's move on to your views.
You started the fight for the presidential castle with theses about the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and on reverse property declarations of more than twenty million dollars.
To do this, the law needs to be changed.
You as president do not have such powers, and only the entire Senate can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I, as a citizen, lobbyed for a tour to become a free enterprise, I managed to make progress.
The problem is in politics - when someone comes up with a good proposal on the left or right, they are deliberately made obstacles, and that is deterring citizens.
As an independent non-partisan, I have a much greater potential to receive support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I can take from each party what is best for our country, without party tiles, without regard to dogmas, and apply it.
Do you consider yourself a person who is more concerned with the right or the left?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people treat me rather to the left.
It doesn’t matter to me – a little to the left or a little to the right.
It is important for me to move forward.
It’s not about someone referring to the right, but someone to the left, I want to unite people.
I will always support any good decision for society whether it will be proposed by the CPCM or the GDP, and I will be exactly the same against the bad idea.
You get angry when someone says you’re a populist.
But don't you prove it by what you said?
When you create a business plan for a company, you also have some ideal goals and views.
And you're trying to get closer to that.
It can be called populism, but all the proposals I’m talking about are already working in the world, or are spoken of by prominent experts.
But without the support of Parliament, you will have only slogans left.
In politics, you won’t last long.
Or do you think that when you go to people and talk to them, you will be able to carry out criminal and material responsibility?
I don't have a choice.
Only to persuade politicians, journalists and the public and try to trick them into our side so that we can achieve ours.
If I had been elected president, there would be no problem in organizing a live television broadcast in which I would address the presidents of parliamentary parties with a call to legalize material and criminal responsibility for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And if they refuse, they will have to tell you why they don’t want to.
If there is a strong personality that will sound abuse, then it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take direct presidential elections - it was a merit of public pressure.
I am a fan, not a genius, not an intellectual.
I try to find allies to defend my beliefs and views.
I am just a beginner in politics, and for my program I will try to get the support of the majority.
I try to make progress on my own; in case it fails, in six years I will finish and return to the private sector.
It sounds like Okamura has to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know I'm not going to do anything alone, so I skipped a number of famous people with an offer to join the Senate.
I went to Radio Janchure, he refused due to a large amount of work.
Also, I have at least supported the lead investigative journalist Yanu Lorentz, who revealed scams with light petroleum products.
I put forward my candidacy because people are really dissatisfied, but now I feel like I’m on weight.
Sixty percent of the people did not go to the polls, and most of those who went were elected representatives of the establishment.
There are only two independents in the Senate.
People chose the Senate in such a way that the changes would be difficult to implement.
Despite this, I will fight for my views, for example, for the direct election of mayors and governors.
Do you think about setting up your own party?
I haven’t thought about it yet, because I don’t have time to check the purity of every potential supporter’s past, and I don’t have money for it.
There's no money for the presidential campaign, on my transparent account only twenty thousand kronor.
You don't have money?
You're talking about property statements, and how are your own business dealings with this?
Personal property is estimated at approximately <0x24>60 million.
I have a plot in Prague worth about 25 million, an apartment for 10 million, another apartment for 8 million, a collection of artworks for about 10 million, an Aston-Martin for 3.5 million, and a Skoda Superb for a million.
By the way, Aston-Martin appeared to me because it was my boy's dream - I always liked James Bond, who was in the car, was galant with women, and at the same time fought against subtlety and lawlessness.
You're going to Aston Martin, you own <0x24>60 million, and you don't have the money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don’t want to invest your own money especially in it.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have <0x24>15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to go into debt?
I have already invested 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don’t have sponsors indicates that my program is not so interesting.
And I don't have to pay for the election campaign out of my pocket.
The cost of the campaign will actually cover me the Senate salary.
But for that money I wouldn’t live, for example, I wouldn’t be able to pay my son for an English school that costs <0x24>30,000 a month.
If I only wanted to make money, I wouldn't have gotten anywhere.
So you're going to continue to do business so you can live?
Didn't you say you're going to cut this down?
It does not depend on the size of the salary.
As I promised, I have reduced my activity in part.
For example, the managing director of the travel agency will be my deputy in the spring.
People would like me to be a non-silver who will preserve the republic.
But I also need to live on something.
How much, as an entrepreneur, do you get monthly?
From two hundred to four hundred thousand, which I still get.
And if I were president, I would have ended my business.
You will find the full interview in the Saturday edition of the newspaper "Pravo".
MVRDV architects prove that true adventures are not only in the imagination - for example, Spacenisse and its newly built Book Mountain - 2 photos
“This building seems fun to me, it looks futuristic, finally we can see something interesting again,” says Lizette Verhaig, walking along the side of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT specialist at a nearby large enterprise, thinks: “No, this building is really beautiful.”
But I ask myself: why do we have another library today?
Everyone has the Internet, iPad and e-books.
No one's willing to go to such old-fashioned libraries now, right?
Spikeniss, a small sleep town under Rotterdam, has an unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 people has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
To combat this annoying circumstance a few years ago it was decided to contribute to the general education and to build seven fictional bridges, which are depicted on euro banknotes, in the form of picturesquely decorated miniatures of iron concrete.
The success of this educational initiative was modest.
And then the city fathers realized that they had only one chance to resist the statistics: to build a library here!
Viny Maas of the Rotterdam Architectural Bureau MVRDV, a master of bold column charts and author of clever, sometimes even cynical structures, referred to the task with his usual reluctance and appeared on a contested audition in 2003.
And while the members of the jury were confused and squeezed with their shoulders, the daring Maas put a pyramid out of his original gift in size and finished his speech in defense of his project with the following words: "Dear Citizens!"
Here's my suggestion: "The Book Mountain" in Spikeniss, the so-called Buchenberg!
Nine years later, the value of this mountain increased by 30 million euros.
It is part of the revitalization project, which also includes an underground garage, supermarket, post office and several adjacent residential houses and townhouses totalling 50 apartments.
In early November, Book Mountain was awarded the second prize of the "Best Library of the Netherlands 2012" competition.
The project also participates in the Dutch National Wooden Buildings Competition 2012.
Thus, the sightless suburb, which previously could offer nothing but a postmodern pedestrian zone and an astonishingly unspoilt town hall, whose white facades suggest the idea of a dairy plant, became richer with one modern piece of architecture.
But most importantly, the first public building for cultural purposes in the history of this town appeared in Spikeniss.
A long way to the book
First impression: Eldorado's book under the cheese cap.
There is only one elevator, passing through the center of the mountain range, as true admirers of architecture and reading will prefer to explore this area on foot.
The glazed from all sides of the room is bright and easy to see, the brick floors and elegant street lights create a sense of public city square.
The urban environment is rebuilt perfectly.
The view is involuntaryly looking for boards, dogs and playing football for boys and girls.
And everywhere there are books, books, books.
“The bookshelfs usually stand along the facades, and in the middle there is a large dark room, usually uncomfortable and faceless,” says Vinnie Maas.
We put a classic configuration of the space from the leg to the head and pulled the reading area from the inside out.
The interior of the book mountain has been skillfully used: in the center are offices, internet library, chess club, environmental center and technical premises.
Particularly happy are the black book shelves, which serve as the decoration of the walls, then parapets, then staircases.
Their appearance, texture and smell are unusual.
Even sophisticated architects and engineers are lost in guessing what kind of unknown material this is.
“We strived to work with secondary materials,” explains Jop Trauborst, the project manager representing the community of Spikeniss, in accordance with the requirements of the standard.
And once on a farm in Frisland we met a suitable by-product of agriculture.
For many years in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands, artificial fiber material of a millimeter thickness is used as a lining under the root.
It is cheap and saves time.
Thin textile serves one or two seasons, after which it can be discarded.
For the library, this canvas - for the first time in such volumes - was pressed into panels of four centimeters thick.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the so-called Landbauplastic (KLP) turns into a dark, uniform, durable material, smelling a bit like a new car and a bit like a cross-shoe.
105 degrees to the top.
Anyone who overcomes the 500-meter-long road will be rewarded in the literary cafe not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and wood chips in pots.
They care about the atmosphere, and first of all about the correct humidity of the air on the literary mountain.
The Cost of a New Soul
“It’s hard to believe, but this building, despite its many glass surfaces, is an exemplary project in terms of ecology,” says Trouborst.
The heat of the earth is used for heating and cooling.
Although the Book Mountain stands under a glass lid, even on clear days the sun comes in only for a short time.
Wide glued wood farms, located perpendicular to the glass facade, give shade and take on most of the sunlight.
The climate in the room is very nice.
The remaining protection is provided by fully automatic roller blinds.
Stephan Spermon, the above-mentioned IT skeptic, has already visited the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already here.
As well as a teacher of traditional Chinese medicine, Cynthia Bogard, who called Buchenberg "the soul of the Spikeniss who had long been missing."
Reason: A few weeks before the opening, each visitor was invited to donate one book from his own collection.
These books were supposed to occupy empty spaces on the shelves of a not yet fully equipped library - at the time there were 70,000 books in it.
The idea worked.
The shelves are pushed up.
“There’s nothing worse than a half-empty library,” says architect Vinnie Maas.
“I think, thanks to our invitation, now every resident is somehow connected to this new home.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it serves only for decoration.
Thus, the MVRDV managed to solve the royal task, which in the professional jargon is called the creation of identity.
Spikeniss wrote his literary story.
And let them be very young and untrained.
This is just the starting point for building an identity.
"Germans need to play a more important role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the recognition of Palestine.
According to Stefan Sabo, an expert on relations between the United States and Europe, Berlin is balancing on a narrow diplomatic path.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany first made it clear that it was voting against the Palestinians’ request for observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained from voting.
- Why?
Stefan Sabo: Germany does not support the actions of the Israelis in Gaza.
Now Germany needs to be cautious about its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don’t think it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence – not to be too critical of Israel, he said.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from voting on the introduction of a banning zone for flights.
In the end, NATO made this proposal.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
The fact is that it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, that is, it is moving from the policy that, so to speak, was governed by the United States, to the very German foreign policy.
The situation is further complicated by the fact that Europeans do not have a coherent policy.
Thus, the Germans again find themselves between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe that they are only exploring their role so far, but are on the path to a “more normal” foreign policy.
Such a foreign policy as is carried out by France or the United Kingdom.
What exactly does “normal” foreign policy from the German point of view mean?
It is the willingness to take a position in their national interests that is not dependent on the position of the United States or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policy, i.e. on exports and ties to certain regions such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany’s economic interests differ to a large extent from those of other major states, and therefore Germany must defend its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote at the UN?
First, Germany has large sales markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Persian Gulf states.
It must therefore be cautious not to offend the public and the elites in the Arab countries.
In any case, it plays its role.
But I wouldn’t give it too much importance, it’s not a completely one-sided connection.
But in any case, it plays an important role in the calculations of the Germans.
Has Germany harmed its relations with the United States by refraining from making important decisions, such as voting on Palestine?
I am sure that in Europe and even in the United States, understanding of the German position prevails.
So I don’t think it was as dramatic a break as the Libyan issue.
It is possible that Germany will even gain a certain amount of respect in this way.
After all, this signals that she should be taken seriously as a player on the international stage and that her interests should be taken into account.
There are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The U.S., on the other hand, clearly vetoed.
Is there a difference between the United States and many European countries?
As a result of American domestic policy, such differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama administration has a deep understanding of the European position.
But given the local political situation, of course, the government cannot openly take such a position.
I believe that substantial differences in opinion are not at all as significant as it always seems.
If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is not at all enthusiastic about Netanyahu’s policy.
Is it easy for Germany to combine its close ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the status of the most important partner in the EU on the other?
I think that’s what makes the situation so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a unified, non-controversial European policy, but that is not the case now.
Therefore, they cannot act as part of a broader approach and are forced to act instead, relying only on their own vision of the situation.
That’s what they do with the euro.
I think that in the future Germany will play a leading role in the development of a common European position.
It is clear that this is not easy for Germany, at least because of its ties with Israel.
This theme has always been clumsy.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they should play a more independent role.
If Germany sees itself as an important international player, wouldn’t it really take on the role?
Or is Germany still being given a leading role?
Germany is not accustomed to this, it is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis – every time Germany takes on an important role, a wide variety of anti-German sentiments are displayed.
The Germans don’t just deal with it.
Actually, it’s an old problem: you don’t want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It should take into account the most diverse neighbors and opinions, and this is not easy.
So the U.S. influence in European politics is constantly weakening, but at the moment the EU is not filling this vacuum, who then remains?
The Germans just have to play a bigger role.
Even if you don’t like it, it’s unpleasant or intensifies your disloyalty to you – that’s life!

"Protection of Trademarks" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren is also.
What is Armani Polo?
It is a fully officially registered name in China, which has nothing to do with the companies from which it is formed.
However, it will be protected until the owners of the original names have filed a lawsuit.
It is unclear whether they will be able to defend their rights.
“Foreigners are becoming more and more difficult to protect their trademarks in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, Taylor Wessing, a lawyer specializing in trademark rights violations in the Far East.
Every week there is a new case of this kind on my desk.
It is enough for imitators to add just a couple of letters to get the right to register their trademarks.
So from Gucci comes Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you can register Prada-Kny.
In the same way, German companies, such as the manufacturer of sports goods Puma, are legally copied.
Pattloch opens a folder with records of the Trademark Registration Office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, the Chinese company registered the Zegna DF Puma trademark, an artificial name that also uses the name of the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that the Chinese are world champions for copying and infringing intellectual property rights is known.
In large cities, there are multi-storey universes that sell almost exclusively fakes.
However, Pattloch's cases are not so. On the orders of his trustees, he opposes that Chinese enterprises be officially granted the right to use the name, which is already protected elsewhere, from the Registration Office of Trademarks.
The Chinese call it Ban Minpai, a passenger brand.
This word is associated with "ban dakuan".
That’s what they call women who are hunting for rich men.
China’s government doesn’t admit its guilt.
“This is detrimental to the business, it is necessary to deal with it,” Pattloch said.
“The trademark is shattered, the unique position is lost, the image suffers very much.”
Financial losses and procedural costs in the affected industries are estimated at millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products.
According to CLSA’s market research firm, China is the third largest and fastest-growing luxury market with sales of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 billion a year.
However, removing dubious records from the trademark registry is difficult, and it is expensive.
The process can last up to nine years, with an unclear outcome.
Pattloch talks about cases in which the court rejected the lawsuits, as after a long time the contested name became "reality of the market".
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he will even have to pay the plagiarist as he damaged his trademark in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes there is the law of the jungle.
There are also famous cases about graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with construction machinery manufacturer Sany, a company that soon before acquired concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
Therefore, the Chinese still have the right to use an emblem similar to the Mercedes star.
The buyer of Volvo Geely originally used a blue-white logo reminiscent of BMW; the process was successful, Geely had to change it.
Fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, whose famous crocodile was looking the other way.
The Chinese authorities do not consider themselves to be guilty.
The CTMO Trademark Registration Office in Beijing confirms that there were difficulties in 2010 due to the lack of staff and equipment of the premises.
But last year there was a “return from the emergency situation in the working process to normal.”
Thus, the number of unresolved cases of objections decreased by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 such cases were closed, 75 per cent more than last year.
However, 81,500 claims are still pending production at the office.
Fighting this is expensive.
As is often the case in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark protection applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China has been leading the list of new registrations worldwide for the tenth time in a row, the agency said.
The same applies to the total number of actual trademarks, only 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan of fees were paid.
To simplify, this means that each registration costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
It is worth protesting many times more, as the case of the German family enterprise Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the group has been fighting against a Chinese plagiarist.
The Germans managed to achieve that the illegal production of fake auto parts had been eliminated.
The imitator, however, enshrined Chinese trademark rights to Freudenberg.
It was an omission of its own, as surnames in Germany are not protected, says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO Trademark Registration Office rejected the claim of the Munichers.
True, in both subsequent instances Freudenberg won, but the opposing side continues to fight so far.
You have to wait.
The matter is now under consideration in the Supreme Court.
Wentzler hopes to bring the case to a good completion and praise the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, “The process is extremely expensive and takes a lot of time, money, and nerves.”
Internal costs are barely accountable, the company’s archives have even had to look at 100-year-old acts to bring evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg unsuccessfully offered the opposite side a "big six-digit sum in euro" for settlement.
“It’s clear from here how much it costs us,” says Wentzler.
The dangers of the Far East are threatening to relocate even to Europe.
That is, if the imitators register unprotected trademarks there.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
The consortium had long ceased production in these areas, but despite this it was able to prevent registration.
"We have to be waiting," says Ventsler.
Both he and his lawyer Pattloch recommend that German companies be very cautious with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark protection provisions, rather, foreigners should “all that is worth protecting in any way should be registered also in China,” says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg loses in the last act of his trademark drama, he will have to pay the opposite side the license fees for his own name, explains Ventsler.
Otherwise, we will be driven out of the market in the disputed segment.
World AIDS Day: to drown, sing, help
In Heidelberg, the Imbonga choir is rehearsing – and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans enjoy it.
A history of relationships over a distance of more than 8733 kilometers.
First, the drowning is distributed: cowboy boots, basketball crossbows, women's boats and men's boots pick up a tact on the parquet floor and quickly find it.
One, two, three, four.
It is only then that the voices of the singers – the alto, the bass, the tenor and the soprano – slowly rise – that they perform, enchant and follow each other.
And Fite Hoff, a 29-year-old director, almost jumps out of his mother’s shoes when he leads them with flexible and expressive gestures.
On Monday evening, in the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Imbonga choir rehearses a new song.
Fifty participants of the choir from 23 to 69 years of age, from a specialist in human genetics to a nursery, attended the rehearsal.
"Obani" is a difficult thing, every choir voice has its own text, in addition, in a completely foreign language: Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS Programme, there are approximately 34 million HIV-infected people worldwide.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
There are 245,000 orphans living with AIDS in Swaziland.
More than 40 percent of the population is HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Essetgeni, the Voices for Africa Association has found bosses in Germany.
70 of them attend a school that prepares for further education.
For <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 or <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 a month, you can take on a manager.
It guarantees the child money for school, school uniform and a daily hot lunch at the Gogo Center.
Imbonggi in Zulu means narrator or praiser.
In this room, they don't say running on a bantu, but they know how to sing.
For nearly a decade, the choir has taught songs in this soft foreign language and from time to time even brings them back to where they first appeared: South Africa.
After all, at a distance of 8733 kilometers of summer from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is the village of Esitgeni, which depends on the voices of the German choir.
40 per cent infected
There are about 2,000 people living there, some still in simple clay and straw huts, among the inhabitants of many children.
More than 300 of them were without their parents who died of the HIV virus.
In Essex, the disease of the whole of Swaziland is reflected in the miniature: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
Cutting the extreme meat in men, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, among the population is hardly accepted.
More than 40 per cent of Swaziland’s population carries the immunodeficiency virus, death in the middle of the fourteenth century is not a rare occurrence.
The choir opened the village on a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but former Imbogni participants saw many children on the streets who were lacking not only parental care, but also simply food, clothing, education.
Without school education, a person in a poor country has no chance at all.
At first it was a private commitment of the individual participants - for a few euros a year to send the child to school and give him the opportunity to get hot food once a day.
But a year later, the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa", which has since been almost professionally caring for AIDS orphans in Essex.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial IPPs include syphilis, chlamydia and tripper (gonorrhea).
Frequent viral IPPPs are HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes and hepatitis.
Skull pedicules and jaundices belong to the parasitic IPPP.
What are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koh Institute assumes that at least four out of every five cases of syphilis registered in Germany are transmitted as a result of sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungal), gonorrhea and human papillomavirus.
The prevalence of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low, but about 20 percent of new HIV infections belong to this group.
Chlamydia infections are significantly more common among young people than among other groups of the population.
According to European data, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
There is also a common human papillomavirus among young people.
How does the number of infections change?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory registration.
The incidence of syphilis, according to the Robert Koh Institute, more than doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has decreased since 2007.
There were about 2,700 cases in 2011.
That’s about one-tenth less than the previous year.
What Symptoms Indicate Venerical Disease?
In infectious diseases, ulcers in the genital area, complaints when urinating, excretion, pain below the abdomen, as well as bubbles or seals can occur.
However, they are often not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide 100% protection.
After all, partially pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also spread through contact infection and with close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examination, especially with frequent change of sexual partners.
With early diagnosis, it is possible to cure most IPPs and avoid remote consequences.
The management, donations and, last but not least, fees for choir performances throughout Germany allow something to be collected.
“We’ve already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjena,” said Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village itself, the money from Germany is available to Zodva Dlamini, a conscious and active woman.
She also ensures that orphans are well arranged, for example, with one of the grandmothers.
Gogos, as they call old women in Zulu, is the backing of the village.
Some of them took up to 14 orphans, gave them a roof over their heads, and made sure that the children in shape each day appeared in time for lessons.
Those who have no relatives go to the shelter at Hanisile, a single woman who receives a salary from the union, as well as two cowboys who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, the association "Voices for Africa" organized a sewing school, built two chickens, and together with the American health organization PSI organized an HIV analysis for many villagers.
It’s hard to imagine, but about the disease, which is so obvious throughout the country, they prefer to be deeply silent.
The King with 14 Women
“AIDS is an absolute taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it’s related to sexuality.”
It is quite unusual for a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his love of excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, such a state-sanctioned lifestyle is also to blame for the fact that the HIV virus has spread so rapidly in recent years.
But it also lies on roaming workers who spread the virus across the country.
Free condoms are literally at every corner, says Annette Lennartz, “but they are barely used.
“The other culture is flesh to flesh.”
To support cultural exchange, the Ibmogni choir travels every two or three years to South Africa and sings songs full of sadness, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-awareness that many in the southern edge of the black continent have known since the time of the apartheid.
The bus, full of whites, who sing songs in black language - such recognition not only brings good mood and joy, but even, it happened, caused tears to the eyes of harsh border guards.
The trip always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit the children.
Although it is difficult to find a small village on a map, it is more than well known in the valley of the Eculveni River.
“Go to Essen, there’s light,” the people said.
And after the 8733-kilometre flight back to Heidelberg, when the melting singers return to the rehearsal hall on Bergheimer Street, you can see that the light is burning here too.
Messager: NASA opens ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that Mercury has ice on the planet.
The ice sheet can be up to 20 meters thick.
NASA’s U.S. Space Agency has proven the presence of ice on Mercury.
Although it is closest to the Sun, there is also frozen water, as shown by three studies published Thursday in the special journal Science.
The Messenger probe has found evidence that the permanently shadowed region of the planet is covered with ice.
Its thickness should be at least 30 centimeters, and possibly up to 20 meters.
It is believed that water originates from comets or possibly asteroids that collided with Mercury.
No one associates the discovery of ice with the existence of life on the planet, said Shawn Solomon, the chief scientist of the probe.
The temperature in Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these discoveries could help explain how water and other life-building elements have hit other parts of the solar system.
Invisible to Earth’s inhabitants, probes, telescopes and small robots, such as the Phoenix, explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images to Earth: small lenses in endless dál.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres, according to the new definition of the International Astronomical Union from 2006, is not a "planet".
This fragment of the infrared image of the Spitzer telescope represents a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars in the form of blue dots, it is harder to identify pink "newborn" stars in the star circle.
This region of star formation — scientists unromanticly call it W5 — was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation of Cassiopeia, 6,500 light-years away.
This overwhelming heat of the dying star was photographed by NASA’s Spitzer telescope.
A donut-like ring consists of a material that the star has thrown out in the process of dying.
In the giant tripod mist, 5,400 light-years away from Earth, new stars emerge from gas and dust.
NASA’s Spitzer telescope took this photo of the galactic nursery.
The stellar cluster of Pleiades, also called the Seven Sisters, can be seen at night with an unarmed eye.
Of course, with the color telescope, it works better.
How the red eye sways the observer's nebulae in this infrared image.
It is located at a distance of 700 light-years in the constellation Aquarius.
The resemblance to the Earth continent brought this mist the nickname "North America".
The combination of normal and infrared photography provides an expressive color transfer.
This new star in all its beauty was photographed only with the help of infrared sensors from the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its Rings: How they originated is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
It may be the fragments of Saturn’s moon that disappeared untraceable 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and clearest images of the Hubble telescope: the Waterloo galaxy
Depending on the color transfer, images of spiral galaxies become real works of art.
Published by the European Southern Observatory, the images show the distant several thousand light-years-long Trifid Nebula in the constellation of Sagittarius.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (three-dollar, three-part), as the dark stripes of dust divide into three parts the heated heart of the bell of the stars.
In the constellation Serpent, astronomers photographed the forerunner of a cosmic collision: at a distance of 400 million light-years from Earth, the cores of the two merging galaxies are colliding with each other and inevitably colliding.
This is the birth of the star telescope Hubble taken in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who don’t like technical shortcuts can call it by the nickname “South Pipe Wheel”.
A photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a fragment of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula, which is 1,400 light years away, consists of dust particles, which are 10 to 100 times smaller than ordinary domestic dust.
This image was made from optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring from black holes 430 million light-years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies called Arp 273 was photographed for NASA by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Scientists call this large spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this star mist is the brightest group of new stars in our Milky Way.
The star cluster is constantly creating new stars.
This stellar cloud, connected to the Rosetta Nebula, also constantly creates new stars – at a distance of 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this bright galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust yet, just gas.
Researchers suggest that it originated shortly before the Big Bang, when there was mostly hydrogen in the universe.
Our Views of the Universe: The Most Important Telescopes
The telescope was probably invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersgee - even before Galileo Galilei a year later began observing the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have become more and more – and their available view of space is getting deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Halle Telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror depicted here had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S.A., a "Big Binocular Telescope" is installed.
It allows you to look into space using two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The Gran Telescopio Canarias has a giant internal device – the diameter of one mirror alone is 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the "Big South African Telescope" in South Africa is segmented - to reduce the cost.
However, in diameter it reaches about eleven meters.
The disadvantage of inexpensive design performance: the telescope is rigidly fastened at a vertical angle - this limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly Telescope in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
Its feature: high light-gathering capacity.
It reaches — despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror — the parameters of the world’s largest telescopes.
Using the radio telescope in Aresibo, Puerto Rico, researchers are listening to extraterrestrial signals in space.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
By participating in the “Search for Alien Intelligence” (SETI) project, any computer owner can help by providing their computing power.
View of the Observatory of the European Astronomical Service (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here stands the "Very Large Telescope" - fully matching its name.
Its four mirrors allow you to illuminate even the medium infrared spectrum in the visual tube.
ESO’s Chilean Observatory also plans to install a European Very Large Telescope.
Its main mirror should be 42 meters wide and will be made up of almost 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the photos should not be expected before 2018.
Until 2007, the two Kek telescopes on Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They have two mirrors with a diameter of ten meters.
The Kek telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which, along with them, also looks into the sky with the help of the Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
In addition, a new giant telescope with a mirror of thirty meters in diameter is expected to appear on Mauna Kea.
You can admire them in the illustration.
However, the most important species from outer space are supplied by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has been providing paintings of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for planets outside the Solar System – primarily those on which life is possible.
On February 2, 2011, NASA reported that 1235 candidate planets had been detected since the start of the mission.
The photo captures the latest preparations of the space telescope "Kepler".
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent to space no earlier than 2018 on board the Arian 5 rocket.
The main mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to search for the Big Bang in the light of the first stars and galaxies.
Scientists suggest that there is ice on the southern pole of Mercury.
However, there is no credible data on this, as the Messenger rotates closer to the planet's north pole.
Radar measurements for decades have indicated that there is ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the “Messenger” spacecraft launched in 2004 – the first to revolve around Mercury – scientists are now confident.

In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach the Biblical age of honor.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A search for a puzzle in a country where 97-year-olds seem relatively young.
A trip through the Talisk Mountains can be called wild and romantic.
A bus with a bus runs along a winding road past the dense forests of hills, stormy rivers and simple peasant houses.
Everything around is so green and bright that you can think you’re in Schwarzwald.
But it is the southernmost edge of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is just a few kilometers from here.
This is where the Talyshes live - one of the peoples of the Caucasus, which is little known, except that they speak perfectly in Farsi and Azerbaijani and are distinguished by their longevity.
The final point is Larry.
The small town is backed by too heavy Soviet-era architecture, which does not at all harmonize with the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too boring.
At 323 kilometres it takes eight hours, as the road has only one track.
The legendary wealth to which the country owes the Caspian Sea oil, here, to the province, before it was reached.
However, Pilate Fatulaeva (48) is convinced that there is something to interest tourists in Lerika.
"In May Baku became famous for the Eurovision Song Contest - and next year we will hold the festival of the oldest people in the world," Fatulaeva said.
She is the director of a museum of longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is documented a biography of about eight dozen whales from these places, which are more than 100 years old. Fatulaev points to a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he's been here for 120 years.
At the age of 136, he had another child.
But the controversial star of the museum is the shark Shirali Muslimov, who is allegedly 168 years old.
There is no proof of birth, however.
And given the fact that the oldest person, whose age is documented, was 122 years old, the age of Muslimov seems extremely questionable.
“He was born in this area in 1805, he died in 1973,” Fatulaeva explains.
The man was married three times, and he had 23 children, at the age of 136 he allegedly had a daughter.
Is that how the muslims added a couple of decades to their age?
After all, even Rembrandt Scholtz, an age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, had heard about long-term residents in Central Asia.
“Increasingly many people of pre-age can also be found in some areas of China, Japan, or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,” says Scholtz, “there are also an extremely large number of very old people living in Sardinia.”
However, due to the lack of documents, it is not possible to scientifically confirm the age, as there were no civil status registers.
Every day a glass of boiled oil
However, there is a fact that people in the area of Lerika are surprisingly often reaching Bible age.
Currently, there are 20 people over 100 years of age.
Why are there so many people in the south?
The Azerbaijani tour guide Farid Mugimzade explains this by special tail genes.
The director of the Fatulaeva Museum, on the contrary, believes that it is a matter of nutrition.
Talismans love meat, bread, and most of all dairy products, many of them drink a glass of boiled oil every day. However, it is unlikely that such a high-calorie diet can be healthy from a diet point of view.
Or is it in the primitive way of life that keeps people young? Rubaba Mirzoeva lives in Chengemeran, a small village near the town of Lerik.
At the age of 97, she is still relatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzaeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She's sitting on the floor with a bottle of oil that she's tirelessly wandering around.
There are eight people living under the same roof, including one of the sons and daughters of Mirzaeva, who have had their grandchildren for a long time.
There are also two children in the vicinity.
In the kitchen guests are prepared tea, which is served in typical cups of armou.
Mirzaeva has perfectly flat and strong white teeth, under the headplate she hides long dark-russian hairs, which her son proudly reveals to us.
I always have my hair with milk, so they never fell out and kept the color.
"And I've never used shampoo," Mirzaeva says.
Monthly pension is enough for life.
She always ate only what grew up in her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peanuts.
I've never bought food in a store my whole life.
Then she talks about her husband who served in the army.
The hardest thing was after the Second World War.
But it got better when the "love father" Heydar Aliyev stood at the steering wheel.
Propaganda doesn’t often sound like an old woman’s speech.
However, the cult created around the figure of the nation’s father, who ruled the country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan hardly knows the borders.
He was in power until 2003, and then his son, Ilham, was adopted by the government.
However, there is no poverty among Azerbaijani seniors.
230 manats (approximately the same amount of euro) Mirzaeva receives monthly as a pension, for local conditions it is a sum that you can live well.
And, perhaps, Mirzaeva’s long-adult son is also right: “The elderly in our culture enjoy deep respect.”
They live in a big family, loved, surrounded by caring and happy.
There’s no reason to stay alive for as long as possible.
The word “human rights” is absent in the Constitution.
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
The rival demonstrations in Cairo show the country’s deep divide.
The future Shariah-based constitution has faced fierce resistance.
The Egyptian president did not buy paphos.
We need to create a transition.
"And his success lies in my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but primarily to Christian Copts, Liberals, enlightened Muslims, and non-religious Egyptians.
After all, all of them, still hopelessly divided in the lost opposition, experience fear.
Fear of the religious state in the Nile at the mercy of the mighty “Muslim Brothers.”
Mohamed Mursi, almost apologizing, said he temporarily cut the jurisdiction of the constitutional court and expanded his jurisdiction “to save the revolution.”
But what he actually wants to save is a 61-year-old engineer who has a doctorate degree from the American University of Southern California, not quite clear to the Egyptians and the whole world.
Will the judiciary be deprived of power?
In fact, 234 articles were shot in a 15-hour night jump with obstacles to an Islamist-oriented constitutional assembly of 100 participants, and this is partly alarming.
As in previous constitutions, the draft says that prosecution is based on “the principles of Islamic law”.
But what does "principles" mean?
It has been and remains a matter of interpretation, and one can fear that Islamists will use the floating wording and the legal leaf that arises in connection with it for a more stringent interpretation of the Sharia.
At least one new article suggests this: in all matters relating to Sharia, Al-Azar University, the country’s most important Islamist institution, should be attracted to the council.
It should not, but it may mean that the clergy oversee the law, which de facto would have the effect of restricting the judiciary.
In the draft constitution, much is interpreted
Another problem: the subjugation of civilians to the military court must be maintained.
These courts during Mubarak’s reign served to suppress opposition.
After the overthrow of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
Also, as stated in the draft, the state must protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "support its morals and values".
Legally, this is so vaguely formulated that state institutions will be able to control even the content of film and literature through this article.
Open text means nothing more than censorship.
In general, no article establishes direct equality between men and women.
But another forbids insulting and defaming the Prophet Muhammad and his Messengers.
But what is an insult and how it should be punished remains unclear.
The wording that “insulting people” is forbidden is also doubtful.
Will there be enough cartoons for the president or jokes about a lawyer?
The question of interpretation, like much in this project, which Mursi proposes to sign, and which he says will be "very soon" presented to the Egyptians in a referendum.
"The Revolution is Back"
There has been an opposition against the superiority of Islamists for several weeks.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in extraordinary unanimity on Friday evening at Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to destroy the document before it could enter into force.
“The revolution is back, and we will win,” said Hamdin Sabbahi, who took third place in the presidential election.
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El Baradei, said the draft constitution was a place "in the trash of history."
Through Twitter’s brief news service, he accused Morsi’s supporters of wanting to lead a “path against democracy.”
"If he announces a referendum, we will go to his palace and dismiss it," opposition leader Yasser Said said.
“We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been avenged,” Egyptian media outlet opposition politician Khaled Ali said.
Many judges also said they did not want to monitor the referendum, which would render it invalid.
"The Qur'an is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, called for the opposite demonstration, but, by caution, not on Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
There was a large number of women under the covers and supporters of Salafis who shouted, "The people demand the application of God's law."
They demanded from Mursi, "Clean the country!" and assured, "The Qur'an is our constitution."
The struggle for power over the symbolic square, on which everything began, provoked the state of virtually civil war.
The Morsi followers, obviously, did not want to take that risk.
The "Muslim Brothers" said that both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution were loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people decide at the polling station in which direction the country should go.
For the majority of the Islamists, this is considered a resolved case.
The concept of "human rights" is never mentioned.
Hafiz Abu Saeda is angry at this forced constitutional process, which, in fact, was to last until February with the participation of all public forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison at Mubarak or presented to the court.
Not because he shared their worldview, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
He was beaten, convicted, arrested.
And now the words "human rights" are never found in the new constitution, he regrets in a conversation with "Welt am Sonntag".
The expansion of Mursi’s influence on all three branches of government in the state disappoints the lawyer.
These measures are a clear blow to the democratic rules of the game and will lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
“Instead of reinforcing the civil state, the de facto president has cancelled it,” Saeda said.
After all, without civil society organizations, democracy cannot function.
Saeda feels that everyone has left him, even the international community, which looks at the ideological struggle of the directions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
There may be payment for this.

Norwegian shrimp: the worst smelling fish in the world?
Norway has one of the highest standards of living not only in Europe, but also in the world.
Perhaps the secret of this country’s success is somehow related to a local addiction to one extremely tainted fish dish?
Take a few ripe pieces of cheese.
Put them in a bunch of dirty and sweaty sports clothes.
Leave them there for a week.
You will get a detachable smell of crab - one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies.
I'm in a small town called Fagernes, three hours' drive from Oslo.
The picturesque views around the snow. It is very beautiful, but in the air melts an indestructible characteristic smell.
Rakfisk is a fore, soaked with salt and floating in the water for a year, depending on exactly which duck you need to achieve.
As the sun goes down and cools, the crowds of Norwegians gather at a festival in Fagernes dedicated to, say, this very, exciting dish.
"It is eaten raw and drunk with a slice of aquavita, local tin vodka," explains Harvard Halvarsen, a local firefighter by profession and co-hosted by the "rack general", who leads the festival.
Everywhere around us, people eat small cubes of fish and drink it with small portions of alcohol.
“Someone likes aquavite more than crabs,” says Harvard.
This drink can break the smell.
I'll try a couple of pieces.
If you manage to put a piece under your nose, then everything is not so bad - little is different from the portion of the sushi that you have been driving with you in the bus for a long time.
Rakfisk is a Norwegian product from quite other times, the times of poverty, when, even before the emergence of refrigerators, the fish in the fall were packed in sealed jars with salt water.
Then in the deep winter, when the fish was already well and thoroughly saturated, it was extracted and, silencing the perception of alcohol, consumed in food.
It is a reminder of the past generation that thousands of Norwegians have been forced to leave their country in search of employment and emigrate mainly to the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, who are attracted here by jobs, high wages and a developed social security system.
The inhabitants of Sweden (an old rival, but not so long ago and a much more lively neighbor) come here to work.
Rakfisk is perceived as an important symbol, an indispensable, albeit a somewhat vicious element of Norway’s past.
This is one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, everything is expensive here - a small glass of beer or sandwich will cost you 9 pounds (<0x24>14).
Norway rarely appears in the world news, and most of the country’s residents seem to agree.
People here still reluctantly mention the name of Anders Breivik, a racist and right-wing extremist, who shot and killed 77 men, women and children last year.
Not to mention his name, the attack is called “the one that took place on July 22.”
It is very difficult for Norwegians to believe that in their peace-loving country one of their fellow citizens was capable of such atrocities and murders.
Today’s well-being of Norway is based on the growth (since the early 1970s) of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
“Oil, however, is not the only reason for our prosperity,” says Anna, our waitress, who carries trays with hardened crabs, a woman with long blond hair and surprisingly blue eyes, embodying the Nordic well-being.
We are such a people, as you call it, reasonable.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks very well in English.
We don't like to show off, we're not proud.
Norway is very cautious about its oil – most of the oil and gas industry’s revenues are invested in a special fund created for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the global financial crisis, when everyone was squandering money they didn’t have, Norway carefully calculated all the costs.
“While you can ski in the winter and go hiking in the summer, that’s enough for happiness,” says Anna.
"And there's crabs," she adds with careless laughter.
I'm standing in the snow in a row for some kind of food - the raft is enough for me.
Here's a hamburger with salmon meat - it's definitely exotic, delicious juicy meat.
But in the evening we are waiting for even more of the same fish with an unforgettable smell.
In my hotel, there is a special dinner dedicated to rafting, during which visitors by voting determine the best or perhaps the most scented fish.
There is a direct telegraph, showing the lead in a butterfly necklace, surrounded by plates with crappy.
It's like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"So, Tor-Jurgen, what grade did you make for the best fish there in the mountains?"
"Yeah, Harvard, here's our assessment."
Everyone laughs and applauds.
Someone's falling off the chair, maybe over the aquarium.
Or maybe just the smell of that fish.
Mexico’s President Enrique Peña Nieto is at the beginning of his career.
As Mexico’s newly elected President Enrique Peña Nieto is preparing to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant invites us to look at the difficulties he will face and the mixed expectations of his country’s people.
The traffic in Mexico is now in a particularly sad state.
The city is overloaded with transport at the best time, and since Monday, steel barriers have been erected, crossing several key highways to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
However, this was done not to prevent people from getting to work from the suburbs, but to prevent protesters from entering the parliament building.
On Sunday, the new head of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will wear a presidential ribbon and take over the government of the country.
There is a difficult task ahead of him.
Mexico has achieved good economic performance under the administration of Felipe Calderón, who is now in power, but the country has fallen into a drug war that has already killed nearly 60,000 people in six years.
“My government is declaring to the Mexican people its willingness to fight violence,” Peña Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama earlier this week in the White House’s Occupational Office.
I am going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve this goal.
Prior to such statements, next to the US president, Mr. Peña Nieto’s political career developed as governor of his home state of Mexico.
At his home, in a densely populated and vast state surrounding the country’s capital, opinions about the new leader were divided.
Straight-line man
In the idyllic town of Vale de Bravo, for example, it is remembered with warmth.
Residents deserve the revival of tourism, the development of the resort area and the creation of infrastructure.
The city can be reached by one of the new highways built by Mr. Peña Nieto, which differ greatly from the roads with swamps and wells that were previously in this place.
The tables with its name hang on the modern building of the sports center and on the impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We are linking hopes of real and serious change to him," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, a state congressman from the Peña Nieto-led Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
We expect the real and decisive changes that are so urgently needed by our country, especially in the field of security and economic development.
After 81 years in power, the PRI party was expelled in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after his 12-year absence at the presidential palace of Los Pinos, the party puts great hope in Enrique Peña Nieto.
In addition, he denies the allegations of inconsistency that the new opposition president has filed.
He is very straightforward and very devoted to the work of embodying his vision of the future of the country.
He is an excellent public figure, and above all, a man who is able to listen.
But in the other part of the state, many people had a different view of the former governor.
The municipality of Nesaualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Ness, is the most striking contrast with the powerful streets of Valle de Bravo.
Hidden under the slopes of highways, it is in many ways the suburb of Mexico itself.
And the problems in the municipality also bear the harsh nature of this megapolis.
Earlier this year, the gangs of drug traffickers in these areas were attracted by troops; violence against women is particularly acute here.
In the desert near a vast landfill only in the last two years, dozens of bodies of women killed have been found.
More than a thousand women were killed in the state of Mexico during the governorate of Mr. Peña Nieto - this is significantly higher than the figure in the sadly-famous city of Ciudad Huares, whose name has become notorious when it comes to non-murders.
According to his opponents, Mr. Peña Nieto, at best, he could be said to have failed to cope with the problem of the murder of women during his tenure as governor.
In the worst case, his administration is accused of completely ignoring the problem.
A resident of a concrete house, similar to most houses in this enclosed area, Irineya Buendia hardly holds back tears, showing me pictures of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of Mariana, she committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family thinks she was killed by her coroner.
“When I got to her house, it looked like her body had been washed before that,” recalls Mrs. Buendia.
There were signs that she was beaten, and her body was already stabbed.
Mariana’s mother recounts this story, and the portrait of her daughter looks at us from the wall, where it hangs next to the crucifixion, on which only one word is drawn: justice.
This, according to them, was rejected by the family.
“State officials treated me like an old conspiracy, an unhappy disturber of peace.
They want people to just accept everything they say and keep quiet.
But it’s not right, so you can’t, especially when there are so many violations and inadequacies around,” she says.
With a presidential resignation on Saturday, President Peña Nieto will take on a difficult responsibility.
Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been affected by violence-related crimes, and the new president has promised to make the issue a priority during his reign.
"I hope he will be exactly the same president as he was the governor," said Olvera, a congressman from Valle de Bravo from the PRI party.
However, this is what the families of the victims in Ciudad Ness are most concerned about.
Bradley Manning did not complain about ill-treatment, the prosecution said.
Prosecutors are trying to refute Bradley Manning’s statements about poor conditions of detention.
During the hearing, increased attention was paid to Manning’s stay in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defence requires the case to be closed on the grounds that Manning's terms of detention were cruel.
The U.S. military is accused of stealing several thousand secret documents.
On Friday, the prosecution tried to prove that rank-and-file Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history, did not take advantage of the many opportunities to file a complaint for ill-treatment, which, he said, had been attributed to him.
During a cross-examination at a pre-trial hearing in Fort Mide, Maryland, military prosecutor Major Ashden Feyn stated that the records of Manning's weekly visits by the administration of prisons for the nine months of his detention in Quantico, State of Vittniko.
A cross-examination in the context of the appeal for the termination of Manning's case on the grounds that the conditions of his detention were cruel and in themselves sufficient punishment was conducted the next day after Manning stated that while in custody, he intended to commit suicide.
A military intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is charged with the hijacking of several thousand secret documents during his service in Iraq.
These materials were subsequently published on the Internet on the WikiLeaks website.
WikiLeaks has not confirmed that Manning was the source of the information.
During the hearing on Friday, Prosecutor Feyn, along with Manning, reviewed the reports that were filled out after Manning’s administration visits during his stay in Quantico prison, where he was under strict detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
During the visits, the prison staff asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When prosecutor Feyn asked about the reports on Friday, Manning acknowledged that he is assessing the appeal by the prison administration as "excellent" and the general conditions of the detention as "very professionally organized".
The reports in question do not contain complaints of ill-treatment, despite the fact that Manning was asked directly about the terms of his content, Feyn claims.
Manning replied that he had expressed oral concern about these issues and that his visiting representatives of the administration had discussed these issues with him and stated that they would be dealt with, but did not fix it in writing.
“They recorded ‘problems are missing’ (after discussing my complaints), but that doesn’t mean I didn’t raise the issue in the conversation,” Manning said.
The military judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about ill-treatment with him in January 2011 during a meeting of the commission, which considered the suicidal intentions he expressed in a written form less than a month ago.
Manning replied that during that meeting he wanted to get rid of the “prevention of trauma” regime and soften the terms of the detention.
Representatives of the military leadership explained that a limited detention regime - at a level lower than a surveillance regime to prevent suicide - was introduced for the protection of the prisoner, as well as for the safety of others.
“I wanted to let the administration know that I’m okay with them to cancel the trauma prevention regime... so that my standard of living improves, from my point of view,” Manning said.
Manning witnessed his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for almost two months, before being transferred to a prison at a naval base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He reported that his thoughts of suicide appeared in Kuwait, and that one day he lost consciousness because of the intense heat.
He explained that it's psychologically very difficult when you're not being told how your destiny is going and what's going on in the outside world.
"My world has collapsed to the base of Camp Arifjan, to the size of my prison," Manning said on Thursday.
“I thought I was going to die in this cage.”
While in Quantico, Manning said he spent most of his time in a small chamber — at least 21 hours, and often more than 23 hours a day — in complete solitude.
Manning reports that he was allowed to leave only mattresses, blankets, hats, several items of clothing and glasses.
He says he tried to move because sleep or even just lying down during the day was prohibited by the rules.
According to Manning, while he was asleep, there was a constant light in his eyes that penetrated outside the camera.
If the guards did not see his face when he turned to bed at night, he said he was awakened and forced to turn his back.
Manning's lawyer filed an official objection to Manning's ill-treatment in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Levinworth, Kansas.
In addition, on Friday, the judge asked Manning about the statement he made during his testimony on Thursday, that after one night he was forced to sleep naked in his room in Quantico, his wife was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners.
Manning said he had not been able to cover up with a blanket during the check-up.
Responding to the judge's questions on Friday, Manning said he understood from a guard's order that he should throw a blanket that could be covered in, but admitted that no one directly ordered him to throw it away.
Manning said on Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because of his attempt to show the officer that he was not in danger for himself.
Manning said he told the officer that he could use a rubber skull or scalp to hurt himself, but did not do so.
That night, according to Manning's testimony, his underwear, slippers and glasses were taken from the camera.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account what he had to endure during his detention, and will significantly shorten the sentence if Manning is found guilty by the military court, which is expected to begin his trial at the beginning of next year.
The defense said it plans to offer Manning to plead guilty to less serious crimes, and other charges to challenge as excessive.
The resumption of the hearings is scheduled for this weekend, and the prosecution is expected to insist that conditions of detention have been justified.
The Pentagon claims that Manning was detained in Quantico in accordance with the rules governing the content of detainees with the strictest possible regime.
Among the allegations made by Manning are the hostility, the illegal promotion of data on the Internet, the transmission of information relating to national defence, and the kidnapping of state property or documents.
If he is convicted in all paragraphs of the indictment, he may be sentenced to life in prison.
My crisis of national self-determination is the story of an American of Mexican descent.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities to realize themselves.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left because they remind the people of the country of difficult times.
Ruben Navarette believes that Mexicans of American descent split between the two cultures.
During a recent trip to Mexico, I walked through the corridor for arrivals, approached the border control area and freezed on the spot.
The signs pointed to two rows: one for Mexicanos (Mexicans), the other for Extranjeros (Foreigns).
I stood in front of them for a few seconds, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in central California, and I have been called a Mexican my whole life.
It’s just a conditional name, just like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and friends from New York consider themselves Italian.
Later, I stopped at the complex design "American of Mexican descent".
But here I was in Mexico.
Here, at my grandfather’s home, there was no need for conditional names or complex constructions.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to be able to ask questions or answer them.
But my vocabulary is poorer than the speakers, and I can’t get rid of the American accent.
That’s why I got my American passport and became a place for Extranjeros.
I remembered this story a few days ago when the re-elected President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House and met with President Obama.
On the agenda were the usual issues for the meetings of the presidents of these countries: immigration, drugs and trafficking.
President Peña Nieto has been eager to talk about the rise of the Mexican economy, thanks to which Mexicans will now, with the same success, be able to stay in Mexico instead of relocating to the United States.
He wants to conclude a partnership agreement with the United States and Canada and create a North American trade bloc like the European Union.
In addition, President Peña Nieto promised to continue the war on drug cartels in Mexico, but no concrete proposals were made.
For Mexico, relations with the United States are a serious and carried out issue of old insults.
Most Americans never thought that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give up half of their territory under the rifles.
But the Mexicans think for centuries, not minutes, and see reminders of those events in everything.
Therefore, it is only for any U.S. state official to silence at least a word of criticism towards Mexico, in the press and among the elites of Mexican society immediately there are complaints that the Americans are attacking the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the descendants of Montesumma are filled with martial arts.
At the same time, the most difficult are the relationships of Mexico with more than 35 million Americans of Mexican descent living in the United States.
You want to talk about insults?
Enough of them.
There are winners and losers in Mexico, people who find opportunities in this country for themselves, and those who don’t have such opportunities.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, so many people of Mexican descent have only one reason: at some point in their family history, someone - father or grandfather - had no opportunity to realize himself in Mexico.
Most often these were Mexicans of a certain type - sluggish, poorly educated, from poor peasant families.
We are their descendants, and we will remember it.
In Mexico, they see it differently.
Today our life is an embodiment of the American dream, we have studied in good schools and arranged for good jobs, but let’s not forget that even this dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is confused and unclear, but we know which country to consider as our own.
The United States of America.
We also know that most representatives of the Mexican elite and the ruling class don’t like us.
We answer them the same.
They see in us a reminder of humiliating defeats and treat us as second class people, as non-real Mexicans.
We don’t speak Spanish well enough, and our ties to Mexico aren’t strong enough.
Our existence alone is explained by our failures.
If our ancestors had succeeded in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
We wouldn’t be behind the silk curtain now, finding a satisfying life in the United States, but losing spiritual connections.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the United States as a child, and it reminds me that there are certain frictions between real Mexicans and Americans of Mexican descent - Mexicans understand their national identity more clearly.
She is a U.S. citizen and believes that she belongs to both countries.
At the same time, many of my acquaintances Americans of Mexican descent do not feel belonging to any of them.
We listen to Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but we also love Bruce Springsteen.
Having the best of the two worlds, you inevitably lose your roots.
We are Americans in Mexico.
In the United States, we are called Mexicans.
Now, as I found out during my trip, as if our relationships were already insufficiently confused, some Mexican leaders and intelligence officials want to restore their relationship with the diaspora.
They want Americans of Mexican descent to work as Mexican ambassadors and represent their interests in the United States.
We could tell our American friends what a wonderful country it is and how great it is to visit it, and we could convince political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yeah, of course.
Nothing's gonna work out.
Too many insults in the past.
And given the gap between the rich and the poor, the rise of corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not consider this country to be so beautiful at all.
Excuse me, but deal with this yourself, Amigos.
And that's fair.
If some Mexicans still cannot forgive the United States what they did to Mexico a century and a half ago, they will have to accept the fact that some Americans of Mexican descent are still offended by the way they were recently in Mexico.
Yeah, yeah.
Maybe we have more in common than I thought.
The Old Battles in the New Middle East
The ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas could become a fragile foundation for further peace.
Is there a long-term peace between the Arabs and the Israelis in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed pushes to a conclusion about the futility of such hopes.
The usual, meaningless controversy about who started the first sounds; many buildings were turned into ruins; more than 140 Palestinians were killed, most of whom were civilians, and six Israeli stalkers were killed; the first time during the conflict, the stalkers were killed.
However, despite the hopeless ties between Israelis and Palestinians in their eternal conflict, changes have come to the Middle East.
This can be seen in different ways, but the events of the “Arab Spring” have surrounded many established realities in the revolt storm, and Palestinians and Israelis have not managed to stay away from the hurricane that shook the region.
Perhaps, as a result, their struggle will become even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons to hope to get out of this deadly slump.
The War Without Winners
At first glance, the situation does not give reasons for optimism.
Even if the ceasefire, which was signed on November 21, will be implemented, the clashes that took place this week have only strengthened the positions of the force on both sides.
The leaders of the Hamas Islamist movement, which came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, said they had forced Israel to retreat despite the losses they suffered.
Despite the fact that some of the group’s leaders have been destroyed and 1.7 million people blocked in one of the most densely populated and problematic corners of our planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is growing in popularity on the West Bank of the Jordan River, another Palestinian territory currently controlled by the more moderate Fatah movement.
Moreover, the leaders of Hamas may well come to the conclusion that time is working on them.
As the influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world grows, Hamas has new, influential and wealthy friends.
The emerging regional leader Turkey, which once was Israel’s closest ally among Muslim countries, supported Hamas; her example was followed by Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Persian Gulf.
Hamas supporters claim the creation of an Islamist half-month around Israel - from Lebanon in the north, which is ruled by the militant group Hezbollah, to Syria, where increasingly pro-Islamic rebels are pro-Kosoya, where the power of Bashar al-Assad, and Daesh will be overthrown.
The most significant change in the balance of forces in the region occurred on the southern borders of Israel, in the most densely populated and important Arab country, in Egypt, where under President Muhammad Mursi the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood was strengthened.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator who did not pay much attention to Hamas’ support.
The Muslim Brotherhood, on the other hand, is an organization in many ways similar to Hamas, and its leaders are more prone to populism.
In future diplomatic settings, Hamas may become a significant player whose voice will not be able to silence even Israel and America.
At the same time, supporters of the “hard” line in Israel will come to the opposite conclusions.
In the military sense, Hamas was overthrown.
The Israeli anti-missile system Iron Dome justified the cost of its creation and successfully destroyed many of Hamas’ missiles.
Israelis can sleep peacefully, at least for a while.
As far as diplomacy is concerned, the United States has remained faithful to its unchanged position; many European countries have also blamed the start of the last round of violence against Hamas.
Another important factor is Israel's economic prosperity, especially under Benjamin Netanyahu's government, which largely ignored the peace process.
Despite the fact that since 2004, about 30 Israelis have been killed by rockets from the Gaza Strip, Israel has managed to minimize the problem of terrorists-deathers, partly because of a wall that is not a barrier that enters the West Bank of the Ivory Coast.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party – as part of the preparations for the January 22 election – has joined with even more aggressive conservatives led by Avigdor Lieberman, is very convenient.
What’s the point of giving Palestinians their own state?
If we put all power into their hands in the West Bank, will they not start launching missiles from there toward Israel, as their comrades in the Gaza Strip do?
It is better to keep them behind the wall and hard to suppress any attempts to raise your heads.
It is possible that supporters of the “hard” line will win; however, their calculations may be rejected in the Arab Spring.
While Islamists who come to power in Egypt and other countries do not have the warmest feelings for Israel, their priority will be internal problems.
Israel’s defensive part of the budget is more than all its Arab neighbors, taken together.
Starting a war with a regional superpower is unlikely to help Arab governments strengthen their own economy.
The pragmatism of Egyptian President Morsi, who worked with Barack Obama on a ceasefire, is a good sign and can mark the beginning of change.
Israel, to a minimum, must take into account the long-term consequences of its policy.
As democratic changes take place in Arab countries, depriving Palestinians of the right to self-determination is a slow-acting bomb that will sooner or later explode in the occupied territories of Israel, like a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repressions are already undermining the foundations of the democratic order in the Jewish state, and the demographic aspect - the growth of the Arab population - only exacerbates these problems.
The bloody operations that are being carried out every few years in the Gaza Strip to suppress the Hamas movement are being paid by the growing dissatisfaction of the international community.
Both sides need an external impulse.
The only solution that remains unfailingly appealed by the sound representatives of both sides, as well as much of the rest of the world and our newspaper: the formation of two States and the surrender of territories by Israel in exchange for security.
There is a hope, not too impressive in the short term, that the ceasefire will allow other countries to more effectively influence the sides of the conflict.
Egypt, which has long been in a position to stop arms supplies to the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar, are more than ever in a position to persuade Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish state, which have been adopted since 1967, taking into account the exchange of territories and settlements in Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also make efforts to reconcile the Hamas and Fatah movements.
This would do more for the establishment of a Palestinian state than the forthcoming UN vote, which could result in the recognition of the virtual statehood of Palestine.
Its role in securing Israel at the negotiating table should also be played by President Obama.
During his first term, he had never presented his own peace settlement plan.
When he returns to the White House, he remains reluctant to join in solving the problem.
This is a catastrophic position.
The United States is vitally interested in the stability of the Middle East.
This is only possible in the case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, the law on unified packaging for cigarettes has entered into force.
Warnings about the harm of smoking and the image of the affected parts of the body are contrasted on the naked green boxes, the same for all brands of cigarettes.
The first in world practice Australian law on the same-type packaging of cigarettes and tobacco products came into force, replacing logos and colored designs of different brands with the same box of unicorn-olive color with the ugly pictures of their tobacco products, skin diseases and children's skins.
In addition to the various pictures and inscriptions warning of smoking damage, the only difference between the packages, mandatoryly introduced from this Saturday - the names of the brands, which are printed with the same small font.
These are the world’s toughest conditions for packaging tobacco products.
The Federal Government of Australia states that the aim of the measure is to keep young people from smoking, depriving this harmful habit of fashion status.
The study found that people who didn’t start smoking before the age of 26 in 99 cases out of 100 never became smokers.
“Obviously, even at a very young age, children understand the meaning that tobacco companies are trying to convey through packaging design,” Health Minister Tanya Pliebersek explains, referring to research, which showed that, for example, the crown in the children’s logo is associated with the idea.
Australia is one of the world's fewest smoking countries, so these changes will not affect the profits of transnational corporations, but the possibility of such measures is already being considered by other countries.
Representatives of the tobacco industry strongly opposed the adoption of this law.
Tobacco companies claim that this will only increase the share of the black market where cheap and affordable cigarettes will be sold.
“This law will lead to serious consequences, unlike those that were conceived by its initiators,” said Scott McIntyre, a spokesman for British American Tobacco in Australia.
Manufacturers of fake products from China and Indonesia will supply much more of these goods for sale on the streets of Australia.
For some, on the contrary, new laws are contributing to business growth.
Sandra Ha from a small family company Zico Import Pty Ltd claims that the demand for cigarettes and silicone case, covering unpleasant pictures on the packaging, has grown rapidly (almost from scratch) and has been high-priced since Philipi has been homeless since two months ago, American Imbriba Toba companies such as American To.
According to Sandra Ha, Zico has already delivered about 6,000 products to wholesale companies and is expecting a new batch.
This is a good business for us.
The potential obstacle to the effectiveness of such measures is, according to experts, the popularity of social networks among the part of the population to which these measures are directed.
After the adoption of a number of laws in Australia that made illegal television advertising of cigarettes and their support for sporting events, as well as banning sellers from displaying cigarettes in a prominent place, the advertising of tobacco products moved to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned local companies and websites from posting advertisements on the internet, but it cannot restrict foreign websites.
“If you’re trading tobacco products and you’ve only got this little gap left, the idea of promoting your product online will seem extremely appealing to you,” explains Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman notes an increase in the number of brand reviews written by the face of allegedly ordinary users on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question arises - is it really the handiwork of an ordinary citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes so much that he did not regret his strength and time and made a video, or is that the advertising company behind it?
The Australian branch of British American Tobacco says the industry is now more busy adapting to new rules than advertising.
Representatives of the tobacco industry have even taken measures such as sponsoring Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules: these states are making claims within the framework of the World Trade Organization, claiming that the trade has been subjected to these unjust, limiting them.
The WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tani Plybersek, the government has discussed with other countries the possibility of adopting similar packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada introduced the first compulsory posting of photographs warning of smoking harm.
This rule has now been adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of tightening laws is being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia are demonstrably disrespectful of innovations.
These pictures don't bother me.
I'm just not paying attention.
“You just pick up a cigarette and hide a packet in your pocket,” explains Victor El Haig, who buys cigarettes with a photo of the oral tumor on the packet.
Honestly, the only thing that can make me quit is my little daughter.
James Yew, head of the King of the Pack tobacco store in downtown Sydney, claims that the same packaging has made it difficult to place items on shelves.
“Earlier I had an hour to unload the new party, and now it’s four hours,” he complains.
“The government had to take and completely ban cigarettes, we would have said, what to do, okay, it’s over, we’re closing the store,” he says, shaking his hands up.
Lacking in the world of electronic networks and constant connections is not so bad.
On this Thanksgiving day, I suddenly had to spend five hours at the airport, because our plane had detected mechanical problems and was replaced with another plane that we were expecting.
So I had enough time to think about the nature of boredom.
I'm not going to deceive you.
The last hour at the airport waiting for a flight is really boring, and there are no books, magazines, iPhones, or even duty-free stores that will help.
Recently, however, more and more scientists and specialists in child development are in favor of boredom.
They say that in certain situations for us and our children to miss is not so bad.
This forces the brain to distract from interesting related topics, which may contribute to creativity.
And since in the modern world we are all constantly in front of some screen, the advantages of boredom go beyond us.
Maybe we should try to get bored?
- Yeah.
And not at the same time.
We'll get back to that.
I used to think, like many, that boredom was an invention of relatively recent times when people had more free time.
This is not true, argues Peter Twi, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, author of the book "The Engaging History of Boredom: A Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011.
“In fact, boredom can boast of a very ancient history,” he says.
On the walls of Pompeii are found Latin inscriptions about boredom dating from the first century.
The question remains as to how we understand boredom.
The problem is, says John D. Eastwood, Associate Professor at the University of York, Ontario, Canada, that the perception and vision of boredom has often changed.
After studying the research materials on the subject and asking a 100-person task force, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the following definition: boredom is when people “will but cannot do what would bring them satisfaction.”
The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is that the bored person does not do something he would like to do.
With apathy, you don’t want to do anything.
The main thing about experiencing boredom, he says, is a “distraction of attention and associated deterioration of mood and the feeling that time is slowly stretching.”
According to the description, boredom may seem very similar to depression.
However, Professor Eastwood argues that despite the possible link between these conditions, lacking people see the causes of problems in the surrounding world and circumstances, and people experiencing depression see problems in themselves.
Sometimes we feel like we’re bored when it’s actually just hard for us to focus on something.
In his study "Unemployed Mind: Definition of boredom from the point of view of attention", published in the September issue of Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and colleagues refer to a previous experiment, the participants of which listened to the note.
Some participants also heard loud sounds not related to the case of the television program included in the neighboring room, others heard the same sounds at low volume, so they could hardly be heard, and the third group listened only to the recording of the voice without a stranger.
Those participants who heard low-noise TV noted that they were bored, more often than others - they were difficult to focus, but they did not know the reasons for this and attributed it to boredom.
When we try to focus on a difficult or exciting task, distracting attention can be boring, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neurology at the University of Guelph, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when we do something uninteresting, “for example, looking at the flow of goods on the conveyor in search of a marriage, distracting music can help avoid boredom.”
It is believed that when people start climbing a chair or drawing caracols on a sheet of paper, they do it out of boredom, but now we know that in fact such actions just help not to relax physically.
“The research has shown that children who are not banned from walking and spinning learn better and remember more information than children who are required to sit quietly,” says Professor Fenske.
At some point we are all bored: with flight delays (as in my case), listening to a monotonous speech, watching an uninteresting film.
However, different people show different degrees of tendency to boredom.
In the 1980s, to measure such individual characteristics, researchers developed a special "scale of tendency to boredom".
To define an assessment on such a scale, questions and statements are used, for example, "Many of what I have to do is uniform and monotonous" or "I have too much interest, so there is no shortage of time."
With the help of such questionnaires, the researchers found that boys miss girls more often, says Steven Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially in the presence of a variety of external stimulants.
In general, however, teenagers are often lacking.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted almost 400 teenage boys and their parents 7-8 times a day.
It received the following results: 32% of teens said they were bored at school and during homework, and 23% said they were bored outside of school.
Only 3% of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson notes that he has no data on what kind of boring data would be like now, 21 years later.
However, he knows that “at adolescence there is a peak of boredom,” mainly because children and adolescents are not allowed to fully decide what to do.
Let’s go back to my original question: is boredom useful?
Sometimes not, because in extreme manifestations, research shows, it can push people to absurd and dangerous physical activities, risky gambling, or the abuse of certain substances in an attempt to get rid of boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have thought about the connection between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this problem for more than two decades.
“So our brain tells us we should do something else; that’s boring,” says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
However, the brain itself does not always know what is best to do.
If you get bored and you direct this energy to playing guitar or culinary experiences, you will make yourself better.
However, if you start watching TV, you’ll only get better for a while, and it’ll soon pass.
Therefore, if your child misses and you give him an iPad, he will stop missing, but he will not learn to fight boredom alone or in any other way to manage his time and employment,” says Professor Fenske.
“And such self-regulation skills are involved in a wide variety of situations,” he says.
Your child not only learns to do something on his own, he also learns self-control in general.
I don't think boredom needs to be carried.
However, it is not worth considering it as something bad either.
Rather, you should learn to feel comfortable even outside the continuous flow of action and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees with that.
“We see this so that we need to experience boredom more often, while boredom is an extremely unpleasant, inexhaustible desire to do something meaningful,” he says.
In fact, people tend to somehow disconnect from constant care and just relax.
“In the modern world, we are accustomed to constant excessive stimulation of the senses, and when silence comes, we are lost and we don’t know what to do.”
It is unclear how the new law to legalize marijuana in Colorado will apply.
Anthony Orosco, a nineteen-year-old football team player and a public college student in southeast Colorado, is accused of committing a criminal offence, which is that he will soon be legally smuggled into the whole territory of the state.
Mr. Orosco says that one day in September he was in Lamar with friends and was driving in a prairie car near the border with Kansas when they were stopped by police.
After a police officer found marijuana in a car, Mr. Orosko came to the court for drug storage and possession of a device for drug use - minor offences, each of which is charged with a fine of <0x24>100.
“We are being treated like criminals,” says Mr. Orosko.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of the uncertainty that has been going on for weeks since Colorado voted to legalize marijuana use in small amounts for entertainment, the resolution of hundreds of small cases does not depend as much on the law as on the location.
The allegations of small marijuana-related offences are already being dropped in hundreds of cases here and in Washington, which has taken a similar measure.
Police departments have already stopped making accusations against people aged 21 and older for storing small doses, which will be considered legal as soon as the law enters into force in a few weeks.
However, in more conservative Colorado districts, prosecutors have decided to consider existing cases related to marijuana, and are still being held responsible for the storage of the drug.
At the same time, some cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the mountainous areas of the West, have voted to prevent the emergence of new state-licensed marijuana stores.
“All this is evolving so fast that I don’t even know what to expect,” said Daniel J. Outs, the chief of police in the town of Aurora, east of Denver.
Representatives of control bodies in the state of Washington also confusedly shave their heads.
They have to form rules to determine the licensing procedure for the cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and all this must be done by 1 December 2013.
They say Colorado, good or bad, outperforms most other states in resolving marijuana use, first for medical purposes, and now for entertainment.
“The Colorado market is more orderly, so they will be a good example,” explains Brian I. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Alcohol Production and Sales Regulatory Board.
But now no one can do more, admits Mr. Smith, than to make some suggestions and hope that it will work.
“We don’t have a real precedent that we could focus on,” he says.
The Washington State Bill, called I-502, will enter into force on December 6 and for a whole year will put the state in a state of uncertainty when state licensing systems are not yet available and the right to own marijuana is already legal.
And there are still difficult technical aspects that need to be resolved during this period, for example, how to find a balance between the state’s order for “adequate access” to licensed marijuana with a ban on trading it at a distance of 1000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and playgrounds.
“It will be particularly difficult to place licensed marijuana businesses in the city, particularly in Seattle and its suburbs,” explains Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the recently established research group “Centre for the Legalization of Marijuana.”
On November 21, a police chief from Aurora sent an e-mail to his subordinates that the city’s prosecutor’s office will no longer engage people who have reached the age of 21 to be held accountable for the possession of this small amount of marijuana, and that the police will “stop killing people.”
Police chief Outs said police would monitor compliance in the city with regulations regulating the activities of people who grow marijuana for medical purposes, and would prosecute illegal drug dealers and drug dealers.
Weld County Prosecutor Ken Buck, in North Colorado, presents a more stringent approach to the issue.
After voting on the bill, he said that the prosecutor's office would continue to be charged with possession of marijuana, mainly in order to encourage consumers to undergo treatment.
At present, 119 people have been charged with storing two or fewer ounces of marijuana, although many of them are also charged with other violations.
“Our institution’s duty is to prosecute for acts that are considered criminal at the time of their perpetration,” Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The reaction was ambiguous even in places such as the rural Mesa district, where voters rejected a proposal to legalize marijuana.
The Grand Junction police, the largest city in the district, no longer holds adults accountable for possession of small amounts of drugs.
District Prosecutor Pete Huttinger supported the decision, but also decided not to remove charges for marijuana storage cases.
“I believe that ensuring compliance with the law until it changes is our direct duty,” he says.
Despite the fact that 55% of Colorado’s voters supported this decision, including marijuana for entertainment in the state and legal system would not be easy.
And the contradictory reaction of residents in different locations in the state has nudged the ambiguity of the local authorities' attitude to the state's experiment with marijuana.
“The district prosecutors have a cultural barrier on this issue,” says Sean Macalister, a Denver lawyer representing the interests of those convicted of storing marijuana, and a local representative of the National Marijuana Law Reform Organization.
“They’ve been chasing people for so long that they can’t really tolerate the fact that it’s not a crime anymore,” he says.
Colorado and Washington, the first states where a small amount of marijuana is treated in the same way as alcohol, are destined to become a country-wide experimental field to verify the idea of drug legalization itself.
Proponents of legalization and state officials are planning to expand the territory of legalized trade, but at the same time they are eagerly awaiting direction from the federal authorities, who are still planning to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Proponents of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Office of Justice will give up on this issue.
Despite several widespread arrests of traffickers and patients who used marijuana on medical records, the federal government has in most cases benefited from trafficking in medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Agents of the Bureau of Drugs are unlikely to burst into the house to confiscate a small bag of marijuana, but they will barely close their eyes on regulated state-run stores, which are a matter of recreational marijuana.
Some cities in Colorado have not begun to wait for federal authorities to act.
Even before the presidential election, some local administrations approved a moratorium to open new marijuana stores, which would still not be able to open sooner than a year later.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the western part of the state, put forward a six-month ban on marijuana, which is likely to be approved next week.
“We don’t want to be in a position that we’re going to grant someone a license, and then this will cause serious problems at the federal level,” said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our city voted against this amendment.
And now we have a contradiction between the results of the local vote and what the state voted for.
There are still a lot of unresolved questions.
Petronella Wyatt: I was survived from Oxford for being a conservative.
The persecution of university students for their views did not begin today.
As far as I can remember, I always dreamed of going to Oxford University.
My father and elder brother studied in Oxford and described it as the best educational institution in the world, a modern analogue of an ancient symposium that lays the two foundations of civilization - freedom of thought and tolerance.
And yet, after two weeks of studying at the University of Oxford’s Woods Historical Faculty in the late 1980s, I packed up my luggage and left, which was the first real scandal in my life.
My father couldn't stand it and cried.
Friends were shattered.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I left college because I didn’t like my classmates having sex in a neighboring room.
Writer E. Norman Wilson joked that I had to leave because I had to drink from whiskey cups.
Actually, it wasn't that much fun.
I ran away.
Yeah, I ran away because I was systematically fed up and scared.
Not at all because of my pretty unusual name or what I was studying in a private school.
I was nurtured for one reason only, and in this glorious cradle of enlightenment it seemed like real barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, now deceased Woodrow Wyatt, was a well-known adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I myself was a conservative supporter.
You'll ask, why do you remember this now?
According to the latest data, a new generation of students, who adhere to right-centered views, are subjected to the same treachery.
This institutionalized and ever-increasing hatred of conservative students in Oxford is so strong that last week a group of such students demanded the same protection of their rights as that granted to disabled, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives from the student club Corpus Christi College in Cambridge say they are “often actively isolated, subjected to personal attacks and forced to feel unwanted guests” because of their political views.
They wish to introduce an additional college representative to the Equal Rights Committee in order to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation was only aggravated by the recent BBC 2 documentary about politics in a student environment “The Wonderland: Young, Smart and Right” in which conservatives were presented by eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
The film featured Joe Cook, a former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association, who rides a rolls-roys, wearing a silver suit and a skull with a silver suit.
In other universities, conservative students complain that they are making “bugs of dismissal due to higher tuition fees.”
Luke Black, 20, the vice president of the Conservative Association of Nottingham University, said in an interview with one of the Sunday newspapers that "in the university environment, the gap toward the left is increasing.
People who don’t even know us in advance consider us to be the sudden and impunity-free children of wealthy parents.”
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student of the historical faculty of Corpus Christi College, who was asked to strengthen protection, calls this atmosphere "unwelcome", and Stephanie Cherryll, 19, is a spokeswoman of Utrecht, said that the new president of the Oxford Utrecht Conservative Association.
"This poses a threat to both the atmosphere of intellectual discussion and simply the normal life of the club members," she said.
For the first few weeks in Oxford, I wasn’t just a minority, I was alone.
I went there in September 1986, a rough and shy eighteen-year-old girl.
Oxford had a fever of hatred for the Conservative Party.
A year earlier, the university voted to deprive former student Margaret Thatcher of her honorary degree due to a reduction in budgetary appropriations for higher education.
In such an atmosphere, it would be uncomfortable even for Stalinists.
In the first few days of the first class week, when the students met each other and the teachers, I first felt what was ahead of me.
I didn’t know that the teachers were not only looking through their fingers at the Conservative students, but they were also happy to participate.
Political issues – miners’ strike, privatization, and the government’s refusal to impose sanctions on the apartheid government in South Africa – have penetrated through the walls of the audience covered with wooden panels.
At my first seminar I had to translate the French text of the eighteenth century into English, and I was not ready for what followed.
“Mrs. Wyatt,” said the teacher, now deceased Harry Pitt, “please translate the first paragraph.”
The text gave me a hard time, I stopped.
Harry Pitt was a very gallant man with a cake-like face.
"Doesn't Tatcherists teach French in principle, or just lack the brains?" he asked.
The other students admired.
I had tears in my eyes.
“I advise you to take some initial French lessons in your free time, unless you are, of course, very busy turning around in society,” Pitt said.
I went back to my room completely unhappy.
That evening, I was sitting alone at college for lunch; then someone stabbed me on my shoulder.
It was James, a second-grade student from the faculty of English, who presented himself as a member of the University's Conservative Association.
“I know who you are,” he said friendlyly.
- Unfortunately, the case is as follows:
Anyone who is suspected of sympathy for the Conservatives will be mocked.
It's not easy for me, and in your case, they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be harder for you.
Most conservative first-class students pretend to be laborers.”
Later, in a local pub, I was terribly trying to hypocrite.
I insisted that I don’t agree with everything Margaret Thatcher said.
The trick failed.
A senior student at the Faculty of Philosophy, Politics and Economics, who studied at Eton himself, said: “You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contagious."
The other students picked up his words.
I was corrupt, dirty.
"How do conservatives have sex?" asked one of them.
- They're rolling another one, right?"
I felt like I must have felt like homosexuals before the end of the criminal prosecution in the 1960s.
Will I ever be able to live a normal life in Oxford?
Or am I going to have to meet unanimous people only under the cover of the night?
Will I be forced to become a laborer and hide my true beliefs?
The next three years seemed like hell, full of persecution and loneliness.
The only teacher in my college who did not hide his conservative views was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history.
He was hated not only for belonging to the Conservatives, but also for being Tatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of her spicetakers.
He barely appeared in college.
He despised him for his provinciality, modesty and commitment to the Marxist-Determinist view of history.
In 1997, he took up a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
“You won’t be happy here,” he said.
I started driving to Oxford from a parent’s home in London, trying to find shelter among relatives and unpredictable capital friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and explained why.
He didn't believe me.
During his studies in the 1940s, political views were adopted there.
“But it’s the best university in the world,” he complained.
- There's no way to do that, but not in the city of slumbering spikes...
Even my communist friends have always behaved flawlessly.”
His wet eyes blurred.
“Don’t make hasty decisions.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
You'll break my heart if you quit college."
I was tired of my constant trips to London and my emotional defense was weak.
My friend, also a conservative, did not withstand the pressure and gave up his beliefs.
The following week during the seminar, when the next history teacher called me “the enemy of the people,” I decided to do the same.
In my heart I was ashamed to admit that my parents had brainwashed me, and called them "old fools."
The breathing was short.
The last nail in the grave cover of my career in Oxford was meant to kill my father.
At that time he wrote two columns each week for publications belonging to Rupert Merdock.
My door was locked.
I didn't go out, and after five minutes my persecutors gave up.
When they left, I picked up my suitcase and set off on the first train to London.
I'm never back.
You can call me a plaque and a stripper.
But at the age of eighteen, no one should become the object of such anger and intimidation in a school.
Sadly, it was Oxford who not only released fourteen prime ministers, but still hides behind the unmerited reputation of the university, in which equality and freedom are valued.
"Valentino prefers the elegance of glory"
About the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Sewing", which opened this week in London, ABC talks with Nati Abbascal, Fiona Tissen-Bornemica and other famous clients of the Italian designer
Somerset House, the former residence of Queen Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of taking an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
The designer acknowledged this at the opening of "Valentino: Master of Sewing", a triumphant retrospective exhibition that brings together more than 130 high-fashion dresses created by his "home" over the past 50 years.
“I love this palace,” he says with his unique Italian accent.
This exhibition is the final part of the story, the only character of which is "or sir" Garavana, but it could not be written without his nominated clients.
Valentino has always felt fascinated by the rare and distant world to know.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, there are plenty of personal letters and photographs signed by the most noble aristocrats, from Princess Salima Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, including Marie-Chantal, Princess of Greece, and Margaret, Princess of Great Britain.
Valentino shows these personal memories as the trophies of his social ascension: from the modest port city of Voghera in northern Italy to the kumir of the international "elite".
Being in love with the royal court is nothing wrong with that.
“They don’t at least light the shells of their cigarettes on your magnificent carpet, as some beautiful pop stars do,” says Baroness Fiona Tissen-Bornemica.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an amazing host and welcomes guests with generosity and elegance.
“We all loved coming in his hat in Gstaad,” explains his ex-wife Haini Tissen, a close friend of forgotten beauties like Marella Anelli or Eugenia Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of glory.
In spite of that, he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, representing Valentino
Argentine model Valeria Mazza recalls a charismatic modeler.
One day we went to dinner with him at home, it was after the fashion show on the Spanish square in Rome, many years ago.
Twenty of the guests were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy, the youngest.
Valentino's style was manifested in everything - in every detail of his apartment, in her furnishings, in food, in music.
“Valentino made each guest feel important and loved,” recalls the “top model” whose work with the fashion designer began in 1995 during the Paris High Fashion Week.
“He never goes out of fashion because his sketches are real works of art,” she concludes.
The Parable of the Family
The life of Garavani is not a history of obsessions, but of lovers with total reciprocity.
He loves people with good education and high titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset-House was transformed into a glamour podium of sixty meters, and a cosy one was transformed into a glamour podium, which offers a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of models and must parade on the podium, watching the "viewers" from the grasses, which shine by the masterpieces of the valentine, as they are.
In this audience of models, names such as Sibylla Luxembourg, Gloria von Turn und Taxis, Matte-Maritt of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg shine.
Nati Abascal and model in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino - as the first love, "is impossible to forget."
I remember him perfectly.
These were pants, shirt, jacket and jacket from the autumn-winter collection 1971-1972.
“It was a gift he gave me,” says Nati Abascal, one of the designer’s muses.
"I prefer him to the rest for his femininity, for his great love of women, because he emphasizes our beauty," added the former Duchess of Ferria.
I really like the colors he uses: there is a lot of light in them and they “approach” to his face.
Proportion is perfect.
Princess and fashion lawmaker Patricia della Giovampaolo d'Arenberg can't forget the first time she dressed in Valentino.
When I was a teenager living in Italy, I dreamed that I would have an age and a reason to wear one of his evening toilets...
This time finally came in the late 90s.
I bought my first dress from Valentino to wear it for the holidays at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edward de Lin.
It was a red dress, with a skirt with wrinkles, a fold-in "corsaison" and a cut without scarves.
“It was a dream that came to light,” says Rodrigo d’Arenberg’s widow.
“Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his passion is timeless,” explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D. Arenberg stores her holiday dresses from the fashion designer with "maximum caution... because the dress is not just a dress, it's also a set of memories that accompany him."
The "King of Fashion"
The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantelle Miller for her wedding to Pavlos of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (as the modeler calls his sewing) to make this suit of ivory silk with an incrustation of pearl, twelve different types of circles and a sleeve in four and a half meters.
According to journalist Susie Menkes, the greatest authority of the specialized press, the dress represents the peak of the high fashion of the late 20th century, "the return of clients from the upper world."
Due to many years of "lifestyle" of the elite, now Valentino himself is its best representative.
The Knight of the Great Cross (sign of distinction of the highest rank in Italy), the Knight of Labour, Commander of the Order of Arts and Literacy, awarded with the Order of the Legion of Honor, Garavani has gathered as many honours as any of the spouses of his clients.
“My attention has always attracted his subtlety, his calmness, his clean and impeccable appearance,” Arenberg recalls.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a festive dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was sitting at a table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribe, my big friend.
“He was unfathomable, time does not exist for him.”
If that's what the princess says...
The heaviest profession in the world: miners with Kawah-Idjen
For four euros, Indonesian miners risk their lives and health by dragging 70 kilograms of sulphur to the top of the volcano on steep rocky trails
There are people for whom their work is hell, while others literally work in hell.
Among them is Anto Vijaya, one of 400 miners who earn the livelihood of sulphur mining in the Kawach-Ijgen volcano located east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Every day Anto descends to the bottom of the crater, where sulfur gas rising from the depths of the Earth freezes when it comes into contact with air.
Rather than huge pieces of sulphur, the total weight of which can reach 70 kg, he puts them in two bamboo baskets, rolls the baskets on his shoulders and carries them up on a rocky road.
To the summit of the volcano, which is 2,386 meters high, only 250 meters, but the exhausted loaders need more than 40 minutes to climb the turtle step, with difficulty keeping the balance and carefully paving the road, so as not to get over and over.
They know that one wrong step can cost them their lives, as it happened to a tourist from France who smashed a few years ago from the Kavach-Idgen rock.
Miners from Kawah-Idjen earn 5 eurocents for every kilogram of sulphur they produce
At the top, they pave the way between the tourists who photograph them as if they were monkeys from the circus and, tired of carrying heavy baskets, walk three kilometers to the weights that the mining company placed a little higher, up to 50 meters.
It is about PT Kandy Ngrimby, the company that has been operating this volcano since 1960 and, let alone its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 eurocents) for every kilogram of sulfur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 euros) to petrochemical production, because this mineral is common in everyday life and is used for making spikes, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for whitening sugar.
“As the norm is to carry 70 kilograms, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each walk,” explains Anto, who usually performs three daily transfers.
He spends three hours on each of them and eventually feels broken, but they allow him to accumulate 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) by the end of the day.
Although this seems to be a miser for such inhuman effort, it is three times as much as he would earn in the field.
"The daily fee for miners is very high according to local measures, where they pay 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day for the collection of coffee and the average monthly earnings equal to two million rupees (167 euros)," - explains the shipper, who previously worked as a stoneworker at the tourist resort.
There his salary was 75,000 rupees (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6.2) a day and the plot was not so heavy, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuvangi, a town not far from the volcano, for a good reason that she was in Indonesia for a while, where she was as destructive as she was, where I was married.
Anto asthma, he breathes hard, he coughs constantly, and his eyes cry because of toxic gases
At the age of 27, Anto spent three years risking himself in Kavah-Idjen, whose cheese had already begun to affect him despite the presence of masks and special glasses.
He has asthma, he breathes hard, he coughs constantly, and his eyes are tearing because of the toxic gases that the volcano releases.
This is the price he has to pay for achieving his dream.
“I work two more years because I want to open a store or learn Spanish or French,” he promises in more than acceptable English.
Punished with life, this nice and smart young man could be a tourist guide, waiter or porter in a hotel, but instead he performs the work of the mule.
To share a dirty wooden hut with other carriers, he gets up every day at two o'clock at night, because the gravel does not stop leaking at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and glows in the middle of darkness.
Defying the shadows, Anto descends into the crater, illuminating his way with a small lamp attached to his helmet, which he himself bought for his money.
Approximately 400 carriers drag baskets with gray on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano
Despite high profits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulphur to save costs and does not provide any equipment to carriers who work on their own and with such deprivations.
In fact, they do not even receive a portion of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) fee for a photo shoot, which, along with an entry ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards of this reserve charge from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its people-mouse.
“This work is for cattle, not for people,” says Badrusin, a 42-year-old root bearer who has spent three decades in Kawach-Igene since leaving college.
Capable of lifting up to 110 pounds, he assures that he will tolerate the work "as much as he can" because he needs money to educate his three children aged 18 to 10.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life
Although the sulphur burns the throat and burns the eyes, when the wind suddenly changes and catches the miners in the dense columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so resilient that no one complains of their severe diseases, which are more serious, apparently, their problems.
By balancing the basket on his back, Unainik can now only lift 50 kilograms in his 53 years.
Every day, he and his comrades carry 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks carry to the warehouse in Tamansari, overcoming the 18-kilometre distance along a narrow trail between the trees.
“I’m not going to retire, I’m going to die here because the volcano is my whole life,” Uninik said, opening his mouth wide, with a few teeth missing.
Of his five children, the older, 30, also works as a transporter of sulfur.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation one of the most difficult occupations in the world: what the human mules of Kavah-Igen do.
Singapore is looking for children to save the economy
Singaporeans blame careers, stress and housing prices and education for the absence of children.
“Singapore’s population needs to grow.”
I'm a patriot's husband, you're my patriot's wife, let's do our civil duty and create a life!
It may seem incredible that these lines are part of a mining ad, but despite this – or perhaps thanks to this – this video became a YouTube hit in Singapore earlier this year.
These phrases are part of a rap that uses local proverbs like "Let's put bao (bulk) in the oven" to laugh at Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising agency that made this video, BBH, lauds the hope that with the help of advertising they will be able to attract attention to this problem in an entertaining form.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to do “their national duty.”
This thing is exclusively for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the main problem in the country.
We are the worst in the world in reproducing our own likes, so we felt that this is the topic that we should touch on.
We knew that the government was trying to do a lot, such as launching ghosts with pheromones or organizing quick dating parties (visiting flashes).
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they didn’t necessarily work.
So we thought, why don't we do the most creative thing possible to solve this problem, namely, make a rap?
1.2 Children's
Those who don’t take it so lightly are Singapore’s government.
It spends <0x24>1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
The state package for married couples and parents provides up to <0x24>15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and provides tax benefits.
But all of this has low efficiency.
Singapore is a wealthy and high-tech state-of-the-art city in Southeast Asia, also known for its leadership conservatism and strict public control.
The fertility rate in Singapore, according to its National Population Administration, is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was below 2 – what is known as the percentage of replacement – was in 1976.
So why don’t Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Married Couples and Families Policy Department of the National Population Authority, says the reason for this is “better education” and “a wider range of career opportunities.”
“This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, in addition to marriage and family-building,” she explains.
These changes in social norms contribute to the increase in the number of singles and the postponement of marriages and childbirth, resulting in a decrease in Singapore's birth rate.
In the meantime, immigration policy, which aims to dramatically increase immigration in order to counteract population declining, is causing outrage among the local population.
There are websites in Singapore where the barely concealed xenophobia thrives against many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who are criticized for maintaining low wages and unwillingness to integrate.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons Singapore’s ruling party had the worst election result since independence last year.
After the election, there was an attempt to solve the problem, using quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the decline in fertility has a certain impact on the nation's economic growth, tax revenues, medical expenditures and immigration policy, Singapore's example is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences.
The government is making every effort not to build so small housing.
For example, this is starting to affect the real estate sector.
The guide to urban development has gone to control the number of small apartments known as the “shoe box” that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments with an area of 46 square meters are very well sold.
However, there is an opinion that they can contribute to the empty way of life and deprive the stimulus of builders who want to build a large family home.
But Lim Yu Sun, CEO of home construction firm EL Developers, says their “shoe boxes” are sold much faster than more spacious copies.
They are more popular, in the sense that such apartments are redeemed for a few days, even weeks, faster than larger apartments.
As a result, our monetary income increases.
However, he acknowledges that the new rules provide clearer guidelines for builders who have previously been put up with prepayments if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Excessively stressed
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing national fertility, after a conversation with Singaporeans working in the financial quarter of the center, they don’t seem to have a special effect.
“People are very stressed, housing is expensive, as well as education, and because of this, many people postpone it,” says the young manager.
Other people may have children.
“But it’s important for me to have my own money and time,” says another 20-year-old.
Men and women mention their careers, stress, and housing prices and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, no matter how the government tries to encourage its citizens to have children, as far as childbirth is concerned, the last word remains behind the Singaporeans.
Personal offline - Personal offline
Confidentiality.
According to the dictionary of the Royal Academy of Spanish Language, it is a property of private or "a sphere of personal life that has the right to be protected from any interference."
What is personal for a minor under the age of 16?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and on social media?
Does he understand the dangers that he is exposed to when discussing situations on the Internet that he would certainly not have shared outside the Internet?
elPeriódico interviewed five children aged ten to 15, frequent users of the network.
In four cases, they associated the term with "something very mine" on a personal level, and "password and username" when applying it to social networks.
“My biggest secrets I wouldn’t have uploaded to the post,” says Jorge, a decade-old who tries to explain the personal significance on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he’s had accounts for two years.
“These are very secret secrets, my mom may know them, but not the whole world,” he says.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures from the games.
I am also having fun with my friends.
“I wouldn’t share a picture that isn’t mine, or someone who behaves stupidly,” he says.
The boy realizes that it’s bad to post indecent photos of naked people, crimes, or write insulting or angry comments.
Jorge says he knows 35 friends he has on FB and nine of his followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother knows, she has a password to one of the accounts.
I took Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they're answering me, I'm just loading them," he adds.
“Social networks are entertainment, I can talk to distant relatives or to my friends faster,” he says.
Without thinking, he replied that he would never accept a request from a stranger.
I wouldn’t have thought of someone who would recommend it to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
This teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and in the latter admits that he does not know 20 people added to his list of friends.
“It doesn’t scare me because we have something in common, music, for example,” he says.
According to the boy, no one broke his trust and asked for his home address or phone number.
“If I’m being pushed or demanded, I’ll just delete them from my account,” he admits.
José became a follower of Ask after reading the recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not a stranger to the experience of what is now known as cybermobbing.
A friend of mine was blackmailed on social media.
He was threatened and stolen money.
“He didn’t know who it was,” he said.
The victim, according to José, did not delete the account.
"Just switched on privacy."
It then explains the sequence of steps to set up an account in a secure manner.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would have uploaded photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or confusing situations.
Yeah, I'd do it if I didn't like a person or if I wanted to.
“Although I know it’s cybermobbing,” he confirms.
Key Issues <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and an education and training specialist, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, it is necessary to understand that the goal of social media is to inform.
“The Internet has emerged as a means of searching for information, but with the advent of these sites, the rules of the game have changed,” she notes.
Porras indicates that academic Mark Prenski, a master of pedagogy at Yale University and author of Digital Aboriginals and Immigrants, invented these terms to explain this phenomenon.
Digital Aboriginals are those, children and young people who were born in the age of technology.
“We’re digital immigrants who have to teach them while we’re still learning ourselves,” she says.
He explains that this topic is complex, “because we ask them to have a certain criterion of what can or cannot be disseminated, published or spoken at an age when maturity is lacking for it.”
“Even so that they are selective, while the most important thing for them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” she adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to show what privacy is for children and adolescents is to ask questions that make them think.
“To tell them not to do it is useless,” she adds.
Then Porras lists some options: there are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, so why do you do it on the Internet?
Or would you like to be published a photo of you like the one you posted about your friend?
Do you know what others are publishing about you?
When you sign photos from parties, do you ask permission from other people to mark them?
And one more thing, does everyone need to know what you're doing at every moment?
Another point is to let them know that they need to behave online just as they do offline.
Rules are the same.
“Outside the Internet, a person behaves with respect, responsibility and other principles, as well as should be on social media,” she says.
Vigilance
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, a professor of primary education and an education consultant, explains the need for family heads to read the policies of social networks in good faith.
Understanding each of the points, they have good grounds for conversations with children about the prerequisites for opening an online account.
“For example, age and what is allowed to be disseminated or published,” he says.
According to Gaurdia, the key question is to remind children of the lesson “don’t talk to strangers.”
UNASUR summit ends without the publication of the Lim Declaration
The VI presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) ended today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, previously declared and theoretically signed by the family of compulsory participants.
Efe has repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the VI Annual General Meeting of Heads of State and Government of UNASUR, but sources from the Office and the President's Administration indicated on the main page that it would be handed over after the closure, but then confirmed that the prosecutor will be released at some point.
On questions about the text, they pointed out that the content was presented by the President of Peru, Oliant Umal, during brief press releases.
The access of journalists to the Summit information was always limited.
During the day, only a video of the presidential assembly without sound was broadcast in the press room with the message "closed meeting, noise is forbidden".
Few information circulating among reporters was transmitted by the press secretaries of some UNASUR Governments who attended the meeting but were not Peruvian.
The only document circulated during the day was a list of participating presidents, which caused dissatisfaction among hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more information.
Subsequently, the administration of the President of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it is a statement of Umala, not an official document that ended the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit of South American and Arab Countries (ASPA), and this time, despite the insistence of the press, the so-called Lim Declaration, which had previously been announced, was also not widespread.
On the official website of ASPA, you can check that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities tried to ensure transmission systems for all journalists, but to limit information to the maximum.
The summit also concluded with a joint decision by Chile and Peru to adopt a decision by the Hague Court, which will resolve the territorial dispute between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Oliganta Umala, and Chile, Sebastian Pinheiro, met at a regional meeting and ratified that they will comply with the International Court of Justice decision, which begins on Monday in The Hague to hear statements from both sides, as part of the accusation that Lima has opposed.
“We will observe and implement a decision that will clarify the disagreements we are presenting in this international court,” Umala said, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
“Chile has been, is and will be a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of disputes, pacts and international courts,” he added, welcoming Umalu’s hand against the backdrop of the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation by both presidents of their submission to the International Court of Justice came shortly after Colombia protested this week the Bogota Pact, according to which it acknowledged submission to the verdicts of this international court after a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, Kotor.
The summit was held in the absence of the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Christina Kirshner.
Paraguay, whose membership in UNASUR has been suspended since 2011 following the impeachment of its former President Fernando Lugo, has not participated in the meeting.
The host president, Olyanta Umala, was responsible for opening the discussions in the morning and closing the summit, a little later in the afternoon, in Lima time.
The head of state read the final document, in which he said that 16 agreements had been adopted and that 31 projects had been approved among South American countries, the estimated investment amounting to <0x24>17 billion.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that UNASUR countries will take "significant steps towards the goal of South American citizenship for which we are expanding agreements on place of residence".
He said that actions were being taken to improve “cooperation in the fight against citizen uncertainty and transnational organized crime, actions to increase the availability of medicines, inexpensive access to the Internet in all corners of South America, and taking into account the cumulative and risky nature of the risks”.
As Europe is in crisis, “the economic union (Latin America) should not have a triumphant basis, but should serve to expand our production base and foresee a better future for our cities,” Umala added.
“We have decided to give privileges to a group of 31 flagship projects that will improve the connectivity of South America’s areas, especially in rural and border areas ... by uniting our countries and forming new economic schemes,” the Peruvian president said in a statement.
Among these projects, he noted, the five belong to Peru, and are limited by cross axes on its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and the two are aimed at greater contact with Ecuador, but he did not provide further details.
The final document also affected the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve its re-accession to the Union of South American Nations,” from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, to be united and to have good relations between neighbours, was another topic emphasized at the summit.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before taking part in a regional meeting, he hoped to meet his colleague from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in a meeting in Mexico to hold negotiations in a respectful manner on the sea trial.
“Tomorrow (Saturday) I may meet with President Daniel Ortega,” Santos said.
"We will review all these paths, they are not mutually exclusive, including the Pact with Nicaragua will require negotiations with Nicaragua," he said.
“With President Ortega, I hope I can tell him that we will deal with this in the most civilized and respectful way possible,” Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they are scheduled to attend the post of the country’s new president, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also within the framework of the summit, the defence ministers of the bloc met in advance for the adoption of the 2013 Plan of Action, which aims to strengthen dialogue and unanimity on the question of the protection of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay form UNASUR, although the participation of the latter of the countries has been suspended.
Peru has a temporary presidency in the regional bloc.
“South America must learn from Europe in the matter of citizenship integration” – Rafael Correa
Ecuador’s President Rafael Correa confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is the goal for which “South America, in this case, yes, must learn from Europe.”
Correa, who participated in the VI presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) held in Lima, told state television Peru that the Europeans “killed each other during World War II” and other clashes, “but they are now practically off.”
He defended, in this context, the project of establishing South American citizenship, which was endorsed by UNASUR member countries.
“It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers across any South American country, as is already the case with members of the Andean community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to bring us back to the past,” he warned.
The President of Ecuador has also expressed his support for the renewal of the Organization of American States (OAS) on the assumption of reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account those who have signed the San Jose Pact on Human Rights.
Those who read the lectures never take any commitments, and we, the South Americans, on the contrary, sign everything.
“It’s inexplicable that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington and is funded by the United States,” he said, pointing to Ecuador’s political asylum given to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa said he did not regret the decision because he did not betray his principles with it, but respected his “deep values of democracy and human rights.”
He added that at the time, “there were certain suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and the process would not be followed.”
He also criticized the Swedish judiciary for demanding that it arrive in his territory to interrogate the alleged sexual offence, while "only Swedish law considers it possible to carry it out by means of a videoconferencing that could be done."
Correa confirmed that there is a risk of deterioration of Assange’s physical and mental health.
“I haven’t spoken to him since he arrived at our embassy, but the ambassador told me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious,” the Ecuadorian head of state said.
What really is, is the danger of deteriorating his physical and mental health due to being stuck in a small space without the ability to do exercise in the air.
"It affects the health of any person," he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to Assange’s asylum problem since June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, through the provision of a guarantee of integrity that would allow him to go to Ecuador, was in the hands of the British, Swedish and European authorities.
We are not negotiating on human rights, this is the word we do not use in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
“The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European judiciary, because Assange’s lawyer, Baltasar Garson, is conducting a number of trials in various European instances,” he said.
He said: “If the UK provides a guarantee of integrity tomorrow, it will end.”
And if Sweden, as its legislation allows, and as it has already done in other cases, interrogates Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London or interrogates him on Skype, tomorrow this problem will be exhausted.
Correa took advantage of the opportunity to manifest himself as a defender of freedom of the press and stressed that he does not tolerate “directness, dishonesty and lies that distort freedom of expression.”
“The main enemies of freedom of the press are not corrupt politicians, but bad journalists who support livelihood, blackmail and extortion,” he said.
In this regard, he remained satisfied that neither these journalists, nor the bankers, nor the bourgeois hegemony countries dominated Ecuador, and added that, being re-elected, would “deep up the revolution for further development in the right direction.”
Correa also supported the decision to keep Paraguay’s veto at UNASUR at least until the next election, arguing that the organization “must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and support coup-de-collision under the mask of legitimacy”, because in reality “the paraguay’s law was destroyed.”
The Ecuadorian president also considered his Colombian colleague Juan Manuel Santos’ wish to conduct negotiations with Nicaragua on the maritime borders between the two countries after a judgement by the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which proved to be “completely justified”.
This decision is not being followed at the moment.
This is a problem between South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to go together.
They need to be treated together in order to overcome them and continue to move forward.
He also expressed hope for a good conclusion of the maritime border dispute that Peru and Chile are facing in the same court, and said it was “right for Latin America to address international instances if the two countries are committed to making a decision no matter how difficult it may be.”
Regarding the possibility of being a candidate for the upcoming presidential election in Ecuador to run for a third consecutive term, he said he was considering this possibility “with great optimism and joy, though sometimes it’s quite difficult.”
Correa assured that if he lost in the February 2013 election, he would leave public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in such unfair situations as Ecuador, social and economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
“My political movement felt that it was I who guaranteed this likely victory, so we have to recognize that responsibility,” he said.
If we win, that would be my last term as president, and then we're out of public life.
If we lose, the same thing.
“This is a decision,” he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned a new course of treatment for Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro, who told me that he had gone to a routine treatment that was already planned, and that he is expected to miss the campaign to return to Cuba.
“This does not mean an exacerbation of President Chávez’s health,” he said.
The Ecuadorian Head of State participated today in Lima at the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which ended with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.
The death toll from AIDS today is the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 when he was announced that his AIDS analysis had a positive result.
"I feel like I've been deaf," he recalls that difficult moment, despite the whole pace of the doctor.
The young man hid it from his family.
Deciding to deal with the disease on his own, he wanted to learn as much as possible about it. And his efforts were justified - he already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
Fabrizio is one of the "oldest" patients of the HIV department of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he fell in 1994, overcoming many obstacles.
He has been living with a diagnosis of "human immunodeficiency virus" (HIV) for 22 years. In the early 1990s it would be hard to believe this - there were too few treatment options at the time, too little was known about the disease, too much was associated with pain.
So, even the director of the Mexican Institute of Social Security’s clinic did not want to say goodbye to him, “because he had a fee.”
In other words, having AIDS at the time was a verdict.
Now it is possible to survive with this syndrome and do so without deteriorating the quality of life.
Nonetheless, not knowing about their disease, so far many people come when the virus has already damaged their immune system and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, "the greatest achievement at the moment is that the survival of the patient who starts treatment in a timely manner, and the survival of the general population in this year is the same," - said the head of the HIV-HG division.
Infectionist and expert on HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008, scientists have come to the conclusion that AIDS is not a judgment, but life expectancy and quality of life depend on the degree of immune system loss of 500, the number of years that the patients have at the beginning of the diagnosis.
Simply put, the above means that anyone who gets a diagnosis of HIV-positive at the age of 25, according to these terms, "supporting control, will be able to live without problems up to 75 years," he explained.
To assess this progress, it should be remembered that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although death rates have declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), and since the onset of AIDS, 60 per cent of patients have died.
Only 255 people died in Khalisco in 2011, and 187 deaths have already been recorded by May of this year; however, there has been widespread access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
Why are there still lethal results?
- Personally, I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
That's how I imagine it, that's how things are in our hospital.
At least the last 12 years we have had no shortage of medications, the problem is that patients come very late because they do not know about their infected condition, that is, in the late stages of the disease.
“Nine out of ten patients come when they already have some opportunistic infection; what needs to be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to make a diagnosis at an earlier stage,” he said.
In their proposal is the opinion of the specialists and officials of the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Khalisko (COESIDA), as well as patients themselves, such as Fabricio, who turned to a private lab for verification, and was motivated by the only thing that it did to a friend.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die and don't want to know anything.
"As soon as I die, I'd rather go to sleep three times a week," they say. But not in my case.
There are positive changes, I eat well, do exercise, take medications.
To this day, only his parents know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life like any other.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I lead an active sex life, but with each other's responsibility, taking care of myself and another person," Fabrizio, who has agreed to share his own life experience with Milenio Jalisco, to make his claim.
Let them check if there was a risk of infection, let them know as soon as possible if they are HIV-positive, so better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that they can live as any other person is responsible.
This message summarizes the theme of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the shelf
There are big gaps between health programs and a simple citizen, says Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who was dealing with the HIV-related problem.
The biggest thing is prevention.
In places dedicated to this task, "in fact, the prevalence of condoms has increased, we were given one or two before, now we are given packages for a hundred, and that's very good, but it turns out that there are those who still do not have access to condoms," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers.
“Why are they for you?” is a popular question, with harassment and condemnation, by social workers, school consultants, pharmacists and health workers who don’t want to hear teens, the propagandist said.
I propose to change this ineffective distribution; that condoms are not just behind the counters, and that hundreds of them are in the machines in public toilets in places that young people often visit.
This is not a promotion of dissolution.
This is not about the payment of beer and motel, said Governor Emilio González when asked if it was possible to distribute condoms under his guidance.
“It’s not sexuality, it’s best to make condoms available to those who already practice sexual activity,” he said.
Key data in Khalisco
A total of 13.435 cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV) have been reported.
The state ranks 4th in the national ranking for new and aggregate cases of AIDS and 13th for HIV.
92% of infections are related to the sexual pathway, 6% through the blood and 2% to the perinatal pathway.
It is estimated that 50,000 people can live with HIV, as for one recorded case there are 4 to 5 people who do not know about it.
Taking into account the ratification by the United States Court of Appeal of a decision annulling the restructuring of the Vitro Group's debt achieved through a competition in Mexico, the scenario has a national precedent that sets a yearly precedent for any national corporation.
Procedures to support the survival of firms, which are permitted by Mexican law, do not appear to be valid in the country of stripes and stars, contrary to international agreements.
In practice, the approval of Judge Harlin Hale’s decision on June 15 in a bankruptcy court in the Northern District of Texas leaves Mexican firms defenseless before the possibility of imposing arrest on their property on that side of Rio Grande.
However, the ruling opens the door to a leading glass producer in Mexico for a referral to the United States Supreme Court, proving three non-compliances.
As an admission, while the judge notes that creditors must be regulated by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the Court of Appeal of the Fifth District, located in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings relate to the contested proceedings considered in Mecca.
The first paragraph implies the cancellation of international judicial cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational enterprises.
In fact, for this purpose, a United Nations Model Law on the Unification of International Trade Law was created, defining the American Institute of Law as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the verdict states that without the inter-company voting recognized in the critical mass of the competitive production of the debts that they had before the parent company of the Vitro branch, the majority necessary for the approval of the restructuring would not have been achieved.
However, this possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro was not the first time that this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Commercial Mexicana, whose intercompany debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Competition Productions.
It is also true that by deducting the votes of the branches, the Vitro creditors who have fought against him in the courts of the United States, namely the "party funds" such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have achieved much.
The vote would be 45 per cent against 37.
The Court of Appeal is lowering this data.
On the other hand, he accuses Vitro of a difficult situation that it has faced since 2008, affected by the severe economic crisis that the United States has faced, hitting the country.
Meanwhile, the Gonzales Sada family firm will appeal the decision to the appellate court itself so that the vote reaches its plenary, i.e. five judges, in view of the fact that only three voted.
In the event of failure, an application for a certificate will be submitted, which will require a review of the proceedings by the Supreme Court, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
Worst of all, the court rejected a document sent by the Mexican government as amicus curiae (“the second court”), describing the process to be followed by Vitro under the Law on Competition Procedures, signaling the country to the banks that it is exempting itself from 15 agreements.
In addition, it is noted that the country has adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules established for cases of interstate insolvency that guarantee equal rights for debtors and creditors.
Carambol from two sides: they hit Vitro and hit the country.
Total Balance
Given the delayed several months of complaints lodged on the table by the unions of Mexicana de Aviación against the former owner of the company, Gaston Ascarraga Andrade, who is accused of fraud management, the Syndicate of pilots has already found bottles.
The court, led by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morino, has just filed a criminal case against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstructing justice.
Accordingly, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to provide reports to the Attorney General of the Republic on the operation carried out by the entrepreneur to extract 198 million pesos from the trust fund of IXE Bank F/589 on behalf of Mexicana Airlines.
Resources would be directed to the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Management Company.
As you know, Ascarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel network.
Surrounded by Dragon Mart
A group of local and overseas ecologists, scientists, businessmen and members of civil society agreed on the creation of a broad front to counter the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as you know, about the giant sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean country of products of an isolated country, with a residential area close to 150 employees.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The busy basketball traveler Hector "Hetin" Reyes has been associated with this sport for more than 60 years and, thanks to him, traveled the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico remember as many basketball stories as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
After all, before the bleeding in the brain tied him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, as a small-class player, a player of the Upper Basketball League, a BSN commissioner and leader of the BSN Fjord with the Cowboys.
“I’ve played many roles in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time as I was the president of BSN, the director-general of the National Team and the president of the federation in the 1990s,” says Isasa Reyes, who was more familiar with Primera Hora’s visit to his home.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate by making this claim.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photographs and memorable things collected along his long journey, testify to this.
Bayamon in the Heart
With the greatest emotion, he keeps those who remember his journey through the Cowboys from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when he turned 15 years old as a co-agent or contract agent.
“These were my best years that I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Cowboy Championships since 1967, as an agent, co-agent or manager.
There have been many years of joy, including five championships held from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year Jerome Minsi debuted at BSN.
From that moment onwards, Cuco Ortis, who was a great administrator, became the leader,” Reyes said.
I remember Gin Bartow, who was here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), saying to me, "I have a very strong player for you, growing 6'7."
"Would you?"
And that was the beginning of Minsi, one of the best players that Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended sniper Raymond Gauss, who got citizenship and became one of our best bombers.
I remember saying that if Minsi brought the Bayamon championship, Gauss would have helped win another one.
I enjoyed the Cowboy Championship with Gauss, but I was already at a distance, because by 1988 he was already the head of the federation.
By that time, I preferred to enjoy his achievements and the achievements of the Minsi in the national team.
I remember winning for the first time in the U.S. during the Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we got fourth place and it was supposed to be bronze, if not the Canadian referee who made us replay the final game.
That team from the 1990 World Cup is the best team you've ever seen?
She is among the best, as is the one that won the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was that from the 1991 Pan-American Games in Cuba, when we won gold and defeated the U.S. team, which was quite similar to the one that won bronze at the World Cup.
Not only did Minshee, Gauss, Ramona Rivas, Fico Lopez and Piculina (Ortis) play again, but also young (Hawyer) 'Tonito' Colón and James Carter, the brothers Leon (François and Edgar) and Mario 'Quichotte' Morales.
The team, which may not have been the best in terms of staff, but has brought us a gold medal and great joy, was the team of the 1995 Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Neuquen, Argentina.
With role-players like Canito Nieves, Pablo Alicia and young Roland Hurruitner in exchange for the players temporarily removed for disorder in the Pan American Mar del Plata Championship, we won the gold against all predictions.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, it was Piculin Ortis.
His performances in international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level like Piculin did.
And that’s without taking into account his career in the various leagues in which he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
That's a very complicated question.
We had a very good young man, including Julio Toro, Flora Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
When I was young, I really liked Leo Arilla’s work.
What do you think is your main achievement in the federation?
Participation in the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and that in the early 1990s there were up to 17 teams in the BSN season.
What do you have to do?
There were things that I wanted to implement, for example, the regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, that the boys from Ponce play only in their area and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs.
Now the guys are travelling and playing too much, and that’s too much.
At least, I see the results of compulsory certification and course for managers, officials and judges.
It's a pleasure for me.
What are you doing now?
Most of all, I listen to music, watch music videos of my era on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren, and occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Icabelle, who has always been with me.
The death of actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931 in Fort Worth, Texas, became world-famous for his lead role as John Ross Yuing, better known as "J.R.", in the television series "Dallas," in which he portrayed a businessman without principles.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil magnate robber J.R. Ewing in the television series Dallas, became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new Dallas season, died Friday evening from complications caused by cancer, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., a Dallas production studio.
"Larry has returned to his beloved home town of Dallas, playing the character role he liked the most," his family said.
Larry’s family and closest friends were with him at the Thanksgiving Fair in Dallas.
Linda Gray, who played his wife's role in the original series and in the sequel, was next to Hagman when he died in Dallas hospital, her spokesman Jeffrey Lane said.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, cheerful, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original personality and lived a full life," Gray said in a statement.
Hagmann was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and he admitted to drinking for many years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in the liver and had a transplant.
Long before Dallas, Hagman gained fame on television due to the role of a decent type in the light comedy I Dream of Jeannie, which aired on NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he plays Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive gin girl played by Barbara Eden, and begins to live with her under one roof.
He was also the main character of two comedies that rarely appeared on the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the film included critically acclaimed roles in The Group, Harry and Tonto, and Primary Colors.
But it was his workshop interpretation of the admirably disgusting J.R. that led Hagman to the top of glory.
The drama series on CBS about the Yung clan and other characters in its surroundings aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising slogan "Who Shot J.R.?", designed to create noise around the episode, full of emotions, in which Hagman's character is almost killed, has sparked international discussions and millions of dollars risked in booklets.
It also helped attract a record audience to the series at the time.
When an answer was given in the November 1980 episode, an average of 41 million viewers watched it and turned Dallas into the second-best-watched entertainment program in history, after the 1983 finale of Mash, which attracted 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s cousin, Christine (played by Mary Crosby), who shot him.
J.R. blocked her and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she didn’t get out of town, but others also had reasons to attack him.
Hagman plays Yuing as an insatiable corrupt man with a charismatic smile: an unfair businessman and an unfaithful husband who wanted his alcoholic wife, Sue Allen (Lynda Gray), to be put on treatment.
“I know what should be on J.R’s graveyard,” Hagman said in 1988.
It must be said, "Here lies an honest citizen J.R. Yung."
It's the only deal he's lost.
Victoria Principle, also the heroine of the original series, recalled Hegman on Friday as someone "big both on and off the screen."
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of all of us who have been fortunate to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new release of Dallas were shown a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The recording of five episodes of the second season has already been completed and the sixth was in production, the channel said.
Warner or TNT have yet to make statements about what will happen to the series after Hagman's departure.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in classics such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to him in 1931 during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on New York's theatrical stages in the early 1950s, and then served in the British Air Force from 1952 to 1956.
While there, he met the young Swedish artist May Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001, he called his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
“I didn’t include anything that I thought was capable of hurting someone or affecting them in any way,” he told the Associated Press at the time.
After a liver transplant, he began to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer in the hospital to help patients experiencing fear.
“I give them advice, I give them courage, I meet them when they go to surgery, and then,” he said in 1996.
I’m trying to offer some comfort, like, “Don’t be afraid, it’ll be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but you’ll be fine.”
He also actively opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
The course begins, which explores "The End of the World"
Each week, students explore apocalyptic phenomena such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
This semester, when religious professor Stuart Charme decided to read a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irrefutable astonishment: the end of the "long reversal" of the Mayan calendar, December 21, for which many people were caught as proof of that.
But Charme had no idea what was expected of him in the next couple of months: the catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, the financial crisis, which some call “long-armaged,” and the growing conflict, where Israel is being dragged, a place where Christian theorists are at a time.
“I didn’t realize it was going to be the most apocalyptic semester of all,” Charme told Rutgers-Camden University students this week.
If we analyze what is happening in the world right now, as if we had only 30 days left, it was a really good period.
And remember, it's bad for those who have an apocalyptic image of thoughts.
And he’s not the only professor who offers courses on the topic of “the end of the world” this semester, theoretically the last in history.
At the University of Temple, Associate Professor Barry Walker reads the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
“We’re analyzing why these ideas are spreading over time,” he said, and the way hypothetical scenarios that trigger certain human actions are proposed.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students analyzed films on apocalyptic topics and studied how they relate to real-life examples.
“I tried to tell the students that it was possible, probably, and impossible,” Walker said.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Professor of Latin American History Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, Associate Professor of Art History and Anthropology, teamed up to read a course called simply "The End of the World".
"We're not adding '2012' to always be able to read the course again if the end of the world doesn't come," Restall said.
Despite the “imminent destruction,” students must learn, prepare projects, and pass the final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be accepted into the Apocalypse, which leaves students no choice but to work “until the very night that the world is supposed to end,” Restall said.
The courses were quite popular.
"The places were over in two hours," Restall said of his course for high-medium students, for which 35 students enrolled.
We received emails for weeks before the start of the semester from people who asked if there were any more spaces.
Students, in turn, ensure that this course is one of the most interesting.
“I like to watch what people do to comfort themselves,” said Bridged Robinson, a 23-year-old student at the Department of Religion and Sociology in Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers-Camden.
And the apocalyptic image of thought, secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort or its absence.
Will Vekes, a 25-year-old student in psychology and nursing, said he watched all the apocalyptic films.
“I’ve never heard of a course that would teach this,” he noted.
I like him.
But none of the students interviewed - not to mention the professor - said they believed in the date of the end of the world on December 21.
“Our first project affected the Maya prophecy, and somehow we discredited it,” said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old student of the last course at the University of Temple in West Chester.
Maya never predicted the end of the world; it’s just a key moment in the calendar, Restall said.
But he noted that there is apocalyptic concern in Western culture, which has several centuries of people reacting to changes around them, predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has led to an increase in these speculations.
“In other places people don’t think about it,” he said.
Especially in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dogerty, a professor of religion at the University of La Sal, who is teaching courses in the Philippines this year, quickly responded to the question of whether he knows any course about the "end of the world" there.
"Filipinos do not take part in the end of the world," he wrote, suggesting the order of the supreme court.
We have mercy from the Pope.
Restall noted that for a long time there was talk of many days of the last trial, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately begin to think about the next date" or to philosophize that December 21 is the beginning of the seven-year period.
Students and faculty are indifferent to this date.
Some said they were going to the end of the world party.
“Maybe I’ll call some of my friends to laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student at the Faculty of Communication.
