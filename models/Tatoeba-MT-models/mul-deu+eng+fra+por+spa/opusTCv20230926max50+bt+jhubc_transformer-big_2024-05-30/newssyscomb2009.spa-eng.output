Populist right win in Austria, together make up 29%
The early elections to the Austrian parliament have brought, according to the early approximate results, a significant weakening of both parties of the current great coalition and an expressive strengthening of the right-wing populist party.
The Austrian People’s Party (OVP) has suffered heavy and special losses, where the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously undermined.
On the contrary, the leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZO), the head of the government of the state of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, is preparing his triumphant return to national politics.
According to the approximate results, Social Democracy (SP<0xC3><0x96>) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8 percent of the vote, losing 5.5 percent of the vote compared to the last elections in 2006.
Worse yet has ended the OVP that loses 25.6 percent, almost nine percent of the vote.
They are the worst, literally catastrophic, results in the history of these two great Austrian parties since the post-war period and especially for the people who called for these early elections.
Still in early July, when the OVP left the coalition, the popular had a considerable advantage in terms of preference over the SPO.
It is clear, however, that the voters punished them for letting the government crash.
Already in the first reactions to the results, speculations were heard about the resignation of the party president and, to this day, vice chancellor, Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could be achieved by Monday at the exceptional meeting of the party presidency.
Such an evolution would obviously facilitate the path of the constant and most approximate starting point of the election results, i.e. of the renewal of the great coalition between SPO and OVP.
In view of the fact that the reinforcement of both right-wing populist parties - the liberals (FPO) have won about 18 percent and the BZO, eleven percent of the votes - and that the social democrats at the same time expressed their fears that the same government would be repeated in 1999, when the populists negotiated with the BPO in a year of unity.
This evolution is clearly betting on Haider who has already announced that he is ready to collaborate with any party and that he is already taking his return to Vienna, to national politics.
The Green Party has also managed to reach parliament although it has slightly lost and dropped from third to fifth place among Austrian political parties.
No other party has clearly exceeded the 4% limit and therefore is not part of the parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India could cool
If it is not possible to solve the problem of Czech scientists who have been accused in India of illegally collecting shrimp, it could lead to a cooling of Czech-Indian relations, according to Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
This is what the minister said in New York, after meeting today with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If this was not resolved then yes, then yes, it would surely come to this cooling," he said after the meeting that was organised on the initiative of the Czech Republic.
Mukherjee said, after the meeting, that the executive can hardly get involved in legal matters.
However, he stated that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>vácha, who was exempt from charge and punished with a fine, the government can negotiate with the local government of Darjiling, whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
“His problem could be solved,” the minister said.
For Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era, sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best, according to Mukherjee, to appeal to the highest courts.
Then you can request the exemption from the cause and wait for the sentence to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his colleague expressed himself in the same terms during the meeting.
"He advises to appeal to the Supreme Court and then the pardon would be possible," the head of Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech side can get into the matter is to get the convicted “competent legal support,” the Indian minister said.
On the other hand, he said that such support is already being obtained by the Indian side.
“We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relationship with India, which has a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize it,” Schwarzenberg said.
On the other hand, as the <0xC4><0x8C>TK said to his colleague, he insisted that the Czech Republic considers the problem of Czech entomologists of great importance.
"We consider it a terrible mistake to imprison and condemn these Czech scientists," he said.
The Minister eluded the answer to the question of whether he had received the promise from the Indian side that he would take care of the matter.
"I've received enough promises," he just noted.
A Czech arbiters a fight on the seabed
I approach an electronic wall map, in it it is represented Australia surrounded by the sea.
He is not interested, however, in the continent but in a small lost spot in the blue ocean.
“The island belongs to Australia and next to it also the seabed that surrounds it.
At the same time, the region is as big as a single continent,” says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the team of thirty members working in the UN Division for Ocean and Sea Law.
His head, Division Director, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the exhibition and sometimes completes it.
Governs this talent and enthusiasm for work.
The seabed still hides a little-known world, rich in natural resources.
Oil and other mineral raw materials can be found, but also unknown organisms to this day that carry the key to the development of cancer drugs.
The bottom is bigger than the solid earth
The coastal countries have begun to vehemently dispute the new territories under the sea today.
According to the UN Treaty, they take advantage of the rights agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is basically the so-called Continental Border which sometimes extends a few hundred kilometers from the coast of the given country.
According to the Treaty, the latter has exclusive rights in all resources of the Continental Border.
“Simplely, by continental edge is understood the part of the seabed and its surface, which is the natural continuation of the continent underwater.
It reaches the limit of the sea coast, and often the limit of the 200 nautical miles, that is, pure economic zone,” Mikulka explains.
The request submitted by the country concerned to the Commission for the delimitation of the outer borders of the Continental Border must be submitted with scientific technical documentation based on investigations and measures.
It is the result of a series of years of work preparation.
“One of our tasks is to organize a technical and legal expert assistance committee.
The Commission has so far processed five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For now, only those of the last three countries mentioned have gone ahead,” Mikulka adds.
Not long ago, Australia’s success had a global impact as it was the first to essentially expand its maritime domain.
However, New Zealand also got it - the seabed area that the commission granted it last week is 1.6 million square kilometers, that is almost six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of dollars for their study.
The profit that will be derived from the use of the seabed will, as promised, be invaluable.
Other states are also submitting their applications gradually.
They can do so up to ten years from the time they ratified the “Montego Bay Treaty”.
Where the Continental Border ends begins the region of the ocean floor declared by the Treaty as a "common heritage of humanity".
Already here, no nation has an exclusive position.
The right to exploitation in these areas is governed by the Treaties established by international institutions.
“The seabed, however, is not a gold mine,” Mikulka said, adding that “its separate areas are legally and clearly restricted and its regime is defined by contract.”
The Czechs in the Pacific
And today, part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It is distributed with other countries of the then Eastern Bloc within the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
He achieved this in 1991 with a treaty as investors as well as a few other states, states called "the pioneer investor".
It has the power to explode in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, the Hawaii Islands and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is somewhat larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The background there is accidental, it is something like a marine replica of the Tatras.
"A total area of 75,000 square kilometers can be exploited.
The area is rich in polymetallic concrete deposits containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,” added Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian employee of the Division, Rober Sandev, brings us a sample of this kind of concretion.
It reminds us of a little potato or a little bit of fantasy, the Shem, which according to legend revived the Golem.
During the release of the hostages, the command of the German special forces was at the scene of action.
To solve the hostage crisis the Egyptian government had asked for help from Germany – the experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special forces command was ready, but the operation was not carried out.
More and more details are known about the circumstances of the release of 11 European tourists in Egypt.
According to data from the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior in the rescue action, the German special forces were also indirectly involved.
Therefore, on the place of release were the specialists of the German army as well as officials of GSG 9, the aircraft squadron of the federal police, of the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation also the experts in the field of logistics of the technical charitable institution.
As ministry spokesmen reported on Monday night, the German forces were not needed because kidnappers, realizing a violent release, let go of their prisoners and escaped.
The Egyptian government accepted Germany’s help to use it as support on the spot.
" Fortunately that time did not come," said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
On September 19, in southern Egypt, the assailants had kidnapped a group of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian, and eight Egyptian escorts.
After the kidnapping in the southern desert region of Egypt, the hostages deported them from one side to the other in the border zone between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained unknown until the end as well as details of the release or possible bailout payments.
In the meantime, healthy and saved people arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages were under the protection of the German embassy.
He did not say a word about the details of the release.
At first in Berlin there was no information about their return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild", five tourists and special forces have to return on Airbus from Germany's air force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The U.S. House of Representatives does not approve the rescue package
The first U.S. House of Congress fails with a large <0x24>700 billion bailout package for financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell dramatically.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected with 227 votes against 206 the government’s package for saving financial markets.
Despite all the calls from President George W. Bush and former politicians of both parties, he did not reach a majority for the program with which the disorder in the financial markets should be limited.
With dramatic action, the desperate advocates had still tried to convince critics to accept the large package of <0x24>700 billion.
Barney Frank, the leader of the Democratic negotiations, had asked MPs to vote, although the plan is not so popular.
“It’s hard to get political approval to avoid something that hasn’t happened yet,” he said.
During the vote, the Dow Jones dropped to more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The reason for that was investors’ concerns that the state bailout package could fail.
It rested at the end of the vote and after the failure was made public, it fell again.
Experts have other serious turbulence in international financial markets.
In order for the program to enter into force, it is necessary to have the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Organizers register the increase in the number of bookings
It seems to be a good winter for German travel organizers:
According to one study, the sales volume of travel bookings for the coming months increased compared to last year – even the winter season by more than 30 percent.
According to one study, despite the weakened conjunction, the desire to travel by the Germans remains the same as before.
As reported on Monday by the Germany Travel Association (DVR) in Berlin, with travel bookings for the winter season travel agencies recorded a sales volume that is 31 percent more compared to the same period last year.
According to the research conducted by the GfK market research institute, the reserves for the autumn months had already increased in number.
So the sales volume of travel agencies in October was almost 11 percent more than in 2007, the DVR reported.
The basis of the results are GfK figures that are the information analyzed about bookings at 1,200 travel agencies and calculated for roughly the whole market.
The data collected are travel bookings made until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weakened course of the dollar, especially trips to the United States are in high demand, the DRV reported.
In this case, the number of reservations increased to almost a third.
Germans’ favorite destinations are not only Spain, Turkey and Greece but also the regions of Germany.
Especially organized trips are very preferred, explains Klaus Laepple, the president of the DRV.
Given the fact that energy and power prices are increasing, in this case travel expenses are "better calculated for the customer than during an individual trip".
Among other things, consumers can save money with early booking discounts or with All-Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
Also in the summer months the trips were well-reserved, so sales volumes compared to last year again rose – although according to another study the number of Germans making a trip, compared to last year, decreased.
My first Oktoberfest
The hits of the open-air parties in the endless Spa, the beer in one-liter jars and the famous people dressed in traditional Bavarian designer costumes.
A debut in a tent.
Susanne Kronzucker and I really don't have much in common.
She is a blonde, the moderator on television and wears a custom Bavarian traditional costume.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is already worn.
But there’s one thing that unites us: we’re barely in a tent, the photographers have already rushed towards us and filled their memory cards with photos – it’s very smooth especially because I’m at Oktoberfest for the first time.
That's how you make friends.
The cheap traditional Bavarian costume seems to fulfill its function.
Actually as a tourist at the Oktoberfest from northern Germany my sense of well-being with a traditional Bavarian costume to this day was still limited.
But after arriving at the Prado de Teresa everything is not for so much.
Almost everyone wears traditional Bavarian costumes or leather pants; none seem to be paying attention or feeling unpleasant – everything is absolutely normal.
Only my front receives rare glances next to a banana stand in the chocolate.
A Munich woman draws my attention on my front that she had dressed in the wrong way: "The left part is single, the half is virgin, the right part is engaged, behind is widow."
Oh, God, now I'm going back to the left.
"It's okay," he says laughing.
The others don’t worry about many of the subtle methods of flirting and wear hats where it’s written “To drink to get dressed!” and show, without asking them, their nude ass.
A young boy who behaves in an exhibitionist manner is called Bob, he is from England and is also at the Oktoberfest for the first time.
To him it seems "gorgeous", which pronounces with a very long "or".
He told me that after putting aside his glass of a liter of beer he just drank.
Put it right next to the fire mouth, most think that's a trash cube.
So Bob is one of the famous people who can drink a lot.
Others aren’t very lucky and can’t drink so much alcohol.
At eight o’clock in the evening, sanitary groups run around the party spot and have to worry about poor drunken people.
Sanitary workers appear every time in group - suddenly there are always four people who bring the covered walks from one tent to the other.
It works as with most visitors: They come sober, they return drunk.
You don’t see who suffers from the degrees of alcoholism and is in the legs.
"They're the ones who can't do it anymore," a health care professional answered my question and disappeared in turmoil.
Victim of Accident Identified by Police
The 63-year-old pedestrian who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex County has been identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road in the city of Brentwood, was involved in the accident that occurred at Shenfield Road on Friday afternoon.
The woman was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of negligent driving.
Since then he has been released under bail.
Turkey Expands Diplomatic Horizons
Long before Turkey became a member of the European Union, the European powers aspired to penetrate the country.
In the eastern part of the Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 steps into Asia, is one of the most interesting relics of the disastrous imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in the Neo-Renaissance style.
At least that’s what the guides say.
The building is set to clock the end of the platforms and leads in front of two towers, one for each corner, all resembled a typical German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The building in its complex is a bit decadent.
But once the box is over, there is no doubt what the company’s greatness was that this was the westernmost door.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Bagdad Corporation.
Germany, a “late-eater” in the imperial game, had the ambition to dominate the Middle East through this railroad that was cured to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond in what is today Saudi Arabia.
However, the ambitions of this imperial Germany failed during World War I.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
Due to the relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, it fell below
British rule and when the forces advanced in Egypt, they pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
The news was bad for Hyderpasha station as well.
In 1917 a munition train exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources said it was a sabotage.
Since then, the station has been declining and has remained on the margins of history.
But today, this railway, the gateway to Anatolia and all the eastern centres, serves - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's willingness to expand its diplomatic horizons.
The governing Justice and Development Party – the AKP – has planned a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
There is now a new cooperation policy.
The Turkish government excellently maintains good relations with Israel and Syria, with both Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To evaluate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I climbed up to a bed and went to the Turkish capital Ankara, in order to visit one of the leaders of the AKP, an expert in foreign policy, Turkish Prime Minister Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning – about ten and a half hours later – after a trip of shocks, which produced the cadences of the ancient world in the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital – a new city, thought to govern a new secular state, far from the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its clear Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in Turkish consensus
It has raised some suspicions in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern stone and steel structure - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by medium-built shopping centers and "power pastry shops" where middle-class managers in business suit - men and women - meet early in the morning to make a business deal.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a center-right politician of almost any party in Europe.
Dress, tie, I'm sure he still has a Blackberry.
“The goal of the party’s foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly,” he tells me.
Turkey has been cut off in its internal relations.
Today it has to look at the east and west at the same time.
It is not a case if it is not towards one or the other.
He has to do both things.
"But surely at some point," I ask, "Can Turkey be forced to choose?"
"Turkey," he replied, "doesn't want to face that election."
I would then underline a point that almost everyone I have spoken to up to that point has recited to me almost in memory: the relations that Turkey has not only with the Middle East, but with the Caucasus region, and with the entire Black Sea, represent a benefit for Europe and the United States as well as for Turkey itself.
The message seems to be: with Turkey on board, Europe in its complex can metaphorically mount those railway lines that open the world to East Asia and the Middle East.
Once again at Hydarpasha Station, after a second night without sleep, my thought goes back to the two German lords, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who had attended the construction of this building, 100 years ago.
How surprised would they have been to know that Europe’s ambitions in the Middle East, for the most part, would be in Turkey’s hands today?
And waiting at the terminal for the ferry that will take me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was considered "the sick man of Europe."
So there’s not much doubt about what continent this fascinating country will be claiming.
Life to Remember: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: which Guildford musical director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (Skeleton, September 11) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the Choir.
As part of the music project for the city, the following year he founded his magnificent youth choir, Proteus.
It’s supposed to be for under 21, but by the time the Proteus sang its final in 1979, several of us were finishing 20 years – we just refused to give up to the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the changing mythological being of forms) represented the choir's willingness and ability to perform any music presented to him, be it madrigal or messiaen, whether not accompanied or with full orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by this young choir was often surprising, always exciting, and it was all due to that man’s inspiration and enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant over the years.
Often Tod told us to "let the music speak for itself."
He would say, “The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there, in the music.
We just have to sing!"
His wand was always absolutely clear and precise, though never taxable, and not too florid.
No matter what the music was, it always ended up at an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any driver should have been a gentleman, this is Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades he directed the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Especially in the last 40 years, I’ve reviewed over 100 of their concerts and I can honestly say that I’ve never been disappointed by anyone – otherwise, I’ve been inspired by them many times.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of greatness and extreme personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, in his words, simply “sold one or two well-known warhorses all over the world.”
We'll miss you a lot.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
in his sequel to William Woodruff (September 25) states that "in 1946 the studies of economic history were resumed at Oxford and in 1950 he won a Houblon-Norman research scholarship... at the same time he was studying for a bachelor's degree, one master's degree and one doctorate."
This is learned from a note by the author of Woodruff in Beyond Nab End, but it is not entirely correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, during which season he completed a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J.D. Chambers, and subsequently published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
He spent the years between 1950 and 51 in the United States, enjoying a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to overlook this part of his career is unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philology
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino 'Flamenco y vida' because his black and white photographs, documentary style, are fantastic.
They drew my attention for their simplicity and the strength they convey, always treating the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feelings.
“Resino knows how to capture magical moments.”
Second assault for Honda's supersales
In November, Honda will launch the second-generation Jazz.
If its predecessor already had a wide habitability, this new monovolume has an even wider interior space.
All this adds to refined mechanics, which increases driving comfort and saves more fuel.
Evolution in the face of revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although the new Jazz aesthetically presents a line very similar to the model that happens, the changes introduced in this monovolume are numerous.
Among other things, it should be noted an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before analyzing the new model, it must be said that this new Jazz arrives six years after introducing the first generation on the market.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than the employee by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Jazz is less well known, in other markets this model is a sales phenomenon.
This is the case of Japan, the country where Jazz has been the most commercialized car in 2002 and also during 2008.
Precisely in Japan, nearly a million units of Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The second market has been the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
Honda, however, wants this new Jazz to increase sales within the segment.
So, while in 2007 the Japanese firm sold a total of 83,000 units of Jazz, in 2009 estimates point to 100,000 cars, which would represent a 17% growth in the European market.
Regarding the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 units of Jazz since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda’s total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, the head of the Spanish subsidiary expects to sell 2,000 units of Jazz in a full year.
It is precisely the arrival of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to greatly pallify the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, brand managers expect to end the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, which is 4,000 less than in 2007, a 16% drop.
Despite this increase in sales Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese firm also expects to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this quota Honda relies on the arrival of another new model.
This is the Insight, a five-door, compact-sized hybrid - 4.37 meters long - that the Japanese company expects to market around 200,000 units a year worldwide.
By markets and according to the Japanese manufacturer’s estimates, 50% of Insight’s sales will be made in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be distributed between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, once its presentation in society is made in January in Valencia.
With respect to the first generation, the new Jazz is growing in all its ranks.
Its length rises up to 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), the width up to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the distance between axes up to 2.50 meters, which means an increase of five centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, does not vary and is maintained at 1.52 meters.
In addition to the increase in dimensions, indoor habitability is also growing.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the inclusion of a new platform and, on the other hand, to the introduction of the fuel tank in a central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz.
Also, the trunk capacity - which has a double bottom system - rises to 399 litres, 19 litres more capacity of the first generation trunk.
It should be noted that these measures are from the 1.4 engine version, as the capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2’s trunk is 379 liters.
Other improvements – in addition to external elements such as rear LEDs or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass – are an improvement in access to the rear seats.
And the doors that give access to the second row have an opening angle of 80 degrees, compared to the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
The engines in this second generation of Jazz are also new.
At the start of its commercialization, this small model will have two 1.2 and 1.4-litre gasoline engines.
Both mechanics incorporate i-VTEC technology that achieves lower consumption, emits less carbon dioxide, achieves excellent mechanical refinement and at the same time achieves a high torque throughout the engine regime.
The first 1.2-litre mechanic gets a power of 90 horsepower at 6,000 revolutions with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 revolutions.
This propeller - which in the past Jazz reached 78 horses - has a 5.3 liters of gas and a 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
Compared to the previous propulsor, which in the previous generation had 83 horsepower, it now has 100.
This Jazz 1.4 of 100 horses achieves a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and 128 grams of CO2.
The ‘bee car’ that avoids collisions
To advance in the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan has been inspired, this time, by nature, specifically, by bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, based on the flight of bees, avoids accidents.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which is the first step in collision prevention technologies.
Engineers from Nissan Motor Co.’s Advanced Technical Center have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Advanced Science and Technology Research Center of the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Brand Management Research and Development, the BR23C is presented as an extension of Nissan’s four-area Security Shield.
This robot is intended to strengthen the collision prevention capability of the brand’s vehicles.
During its flight, each bee creates its own personal space with an oval shape that is very similar to the Nissan Safety Shield.
But most importantly, the bee’s composite eyes, capable of seeing at an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions, allowing it to fly uninterruptedly within its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers designed what they have called a laser range finder.
It detects obstacles up to two meters away within a radius of 180 degrees in front of the BR23C, calculates the distance to said object and sends a signal to an approach microprocessor that immediately translates into collision prevention.
“As soon as you detect an obstacle, the small robot will mimic the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by rotating its wheels at a straight or larger angle to avoid collision.
The biggest difference with any existing system is that the escape maneuver is totally instinctive.
If it weren’t, the robot wouldn’t be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be turned upwards or downwards, or diagonally; it can only be moved in two dimensions and in the direction that allow it to rotate its wheels and not in infinite directions and ways like bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotational function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, for the small robot to avoid collisions.
“This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and act according to that data.
It does not require saving information or intuitive logic from previous maneuvers, so it can work continuously with just a few dozen KB of memory.
This may surprise you, but we’re not talking about memory gigs, not even mega ones.”
This is the first step in developing new instantaneous collision prevention technologies, a technology Nissan predicts that will be introduced to serial cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than the variety of lithium ions.
Another possible future application of this technology could be the integration of the unit with a satellite navigation GPS system to guide the driver to their destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
Tiemble before mortgaging
It must be acknowledged that the U.S. Treasury Department, in addition to having a lot of liquid to make injections, is not lacking ingenuity.
In the face of the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on junk mortgages in questionable solvency banks, they have created a soft and informative game for the browser: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
I mean, the "hotel of bad credits"... or trouble.
The tricky aspect of this accommodation and especially of your receptionist is to think one, two, and up to three times if it’s time to order a credit.
And, above all, where to do it, what is probably your goal.
It is true that you have useful, but not detailed information.
It’s more a teenage page than a site for all audiences.
What happens if the game is completed?
There is a dream room inside the hotel.
Something is something, because to buy a better house we don't even talk about...
Morgan Stanley sells shares to Japanese MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry into its capital of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan’s first bank, which will pay <0x24>9 billion to acquire 21 percent of its capital, a news that has been accepted with a strong drop in its stock price.
A week after discovering a provisional agreement, both banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s regular shares at a unit price of <0x24>25.25, or <0x24>3 billion.
The agreed price is less than 19% of the accounting value of the securities as of August 31.
MUFG will invest an additional <0x24>6 billion with the purchase of convertible securities, which will ensure a 10% return and a conversion price of <0x24>31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global transaction would be based on a unit price of <0x24>29, or 28% above its current change.
Morgan Stanley's shares lost 6.79 percent to <0x24>23.07 each at 17:00 GMT.
“This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to bank holding status,” said Juan Mack, the group’s CEO.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new status last week, which would have to allow him to diversify his activities but he passes under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street’s larger names to adopt a much more prudent behavior than before.
The modalities presented last Monday also show that the deal has been modified over the past few days: on Monday, Morgan had announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japan for almost <0x24>8.5 billion.
" A week ago, Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG, explained in Tokyo, " we thought the participation would have consisted only of ordinary shares.
But in view of the current situation of the economy and the market, we have wanted to minimize the risks and cover ourselves.”
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below its accounting value.
And the operation will result in a dilution of about 20% of the profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares within a year if they are sold at more than 50% above the conversion price, i.e. at <0x24>47 more or less, over a given period.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital provided by MUFG will allow you to take investment opportunities, strengthen your balance sheet and increase your liquidity.
A spokeswoman for the group declined to provide details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley is expected to show a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan said he had eased his balance sheet a lot since late August.
The past few weeks have been exhausting for the group, which saw its stock exchange rate drop by half while the cost of security against a risk of defects over its debt was dropping.
This cost fell back last Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the sole “survivor” of Wall Street’s major investment banks after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, announced it had raised <0x24>15 billion, in part for Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s group.
Rafael Correa in Quito, this Monday.
Restoring the Republic around 21st Century Socialism.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, in the example of his colleagues and friends, is the third to put to the vote a draft for a new Constitution.
Mission fulfilled as 64% of voters voted "yes" to the referendum, according to official results that refer to 80% of the votes.
According to these results, the "no" got 28%, 7% of the votes were null and 0.7% were blank votes.
In order for the draft constitution to be adopted, one more half of the votes had to be obtained.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the exit of the polling stations and a count on the part of a non-governmental organization had announced a broad victory to the "yes", estimating it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had further claimed on the night of Sunday to Monday the victory of his draft constitution.
The “Constitution triumphed overwhelmingly,” he had assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians who led the government of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
Thus, Rafael Correa has been congratulated by Chavez and Morales but also by his Chilean colleague Micaela Bachelet.
The elections, which will be held in full calm, according to the observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), referred to a 444-point text that consolidated the president-sponsored " new socialism " .
The draft Constitution involves increasing the power of the State over the economy, reserving the " development planning " of a country that lives essentially thanks to the extraction of oil by foreign companies and thanks to the currencies sent by its emigrants.
Led by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants reinforced powers to the Head of State, which will be able to hold up to two consecutive four-year mandates each and will have the possibility of disbanding the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and will seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President began to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It finally provides for a ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for U.S. anti-drug operations.
19 kidnapped people have been released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts captured ten days ago.
They are in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts kidnapped ten days ago in the desert arrived in the Egyptian capital after being released on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they had been released by the Egyptian special forces in Chad.
All of them had a good look at their arrival at 3:30 p.m. on board a special plane to the military base of Al Maza, adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
Helicopters immediately transported them to the Maadi hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, to undergo medical tests, so they were unable to speak to the press.
"They are well" and "no rescue was paid" to the kidnappers, said at the airport Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garana.
On September 19, these hostages fell into the power of 35 unknown hijackers while enjoying an all-terrain safari in a desert area at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, and have since passed from one Zulu to another.
The group consisted of eleven tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the travel agency Aegyptus, in charge of the organization of the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the special forces, transported on board two helicopters, had launched the assault during the night before dawn.
"A shooting swap occurred, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest have fled," said the official who kept the anonymity.
According to him, 150 members of the Egyptian special forces were sent to Sudan, where they had the support of German and Italian commandos.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini mentioned in Belgrade the role played by secret agents and members of the Italian special forces.
“We have to recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and effectiveness of our men from the secret services, from the special forces,” he said.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The Sudanese army said it had intercepted an all-terrain patrol on board of which were the hijackers, who killed six, including the Chadian chief and arrested two.
He also claimed that they were related to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan-Unity Liberation Movement (SLA-U), a statement immediately denied by this group.
lyrics - Silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes the headlines and occupies the current election campaign.
Better that way.
But one sector of our cultural life is always forgotten.
Who will stand up to denounce the miserable sums awarded to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites that starve to death?
Which politician will dare to remind the federal government to neglect its monuments and heritage buildings?
Why don’t we have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage as in Canada and Quebec?
Did you know that the French government devotes three and a half million euros to restoring only the Château de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
In the United States, it is written in its Constitution that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected people and all government departments, and all of this, in concert.
In Quebec, in the Federation of Historical Societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 charitable people grouped into 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned with searching for history, preserving with little money lots of private archives, and preserving archaeological vestiges.
These are often the guard dogs of our heritage, who protest with energy and despair when promoters and managers throw their bulldozers at our old stones and our forgotten cemeteries.
For when, a monument to history and heritage?
The Dutch governments nationalize part of the Fortis Bank.
The states of the Netherlands - being the first in Europe - will help with a nationalization of the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis that is in trouble due to the effect of the mortgage crisis in the US market: the three countries will in total support with <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.2 billion to this financial and insurance institution that also has business in Hung.
This weekend, the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held high-level consultations with the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission’s Economic Competition Officer.
The Fortis Bank is the first to suffer the Eurozone crisis in the context of the international financial crisis that is occurring in several waves more than a year ago, so decisions taken with regard to the Bank can in a sense be regarded as precedents.
According to the decision taken in the early hours of Sunday, the three states will buy about half (49 percent) of the bank’s property in their area.
The Bank will certainly sell a portion of its business, including mainly the insurance activities purchased last year by the Dutch ABN Amró.
Fortis stocks started a strong decline last week and for the second half of the week there were already significant signs of crisis in the institution.
However, analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the Bank is too large to allow it to collapse.
The company’s shares on Friday alone declined by 12 percent, the lowest point in the last 14 years.
Since January, the value of shares has decreased by more than two-thirds.
Looking at the current stock prices, the total value of the group’s capital in the market is around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14 billion, but according to the company’s executives this is not real.
The Bank’s management blamed the sudden drop in Fortis shares to U.S. market insecurity in connection with the approval of the U.S. package plan of <0x24>700 billion.
Shares showed a slight increase on Monday.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the new CEO of the bank.
The Bank also sought private investors, but so far no one has made a concrete offer.
The Belgian government had previously assured investors that they had no reason to worry, they would not lose their money.
Among the Bank’s clients so far there was no panic, they did not invade the bank offices to withdraw their money.
Fortis has its own branch in Hungary and has also purchased leasing companies.
Zorro in the Chicken
In the United States, life and health insurance companies often refuse to sign an insurance contract when viewing drug purchase data.
Privacy policy specialists fear that the personal data market will become uncontrollable.
“There are programs for the protection of personal data, which in all cases bind the use of prescription data to the approval of the person concerned.
The same should be in independent hands, because otherwise, "we trust the chicken to the fox" - quotes the Washington Post to Richard Dick, designer of the prescription tracking program.
Insurance companies make the insurance price and the amount of compensation depend on the health status of the customer and if they believe the risk is excessive, they simply do not make the contract.
Previously, they sent the client to medical check and signed the contract with him knowing the result of the check.
Dick invented a much cheaper procedure ten years ago: with the customer identification number, pharmacy easily gets the list of drugs purchased in the last year and a half, and the program itself draws conclusions about the patient’s illness and health status.
For example, if you take systematically large doses of cholesterol-lowering pills, it indicates that your blood fat level is practically incurably high, so you are immediately included in a higher risk category.
Numerous versions of the program circulate, some even establish a risk number, so the insurance company in addition to the administration has barely anything to do, although there are small difficulties in this regard.
Among the disadvantages of the program is, for example, that some drugs are multipurpose, for example, certain substances serve both to treat headaches and heatwaves and even as antidepressants.
The latter is an important risk-increasing factor for insurance companies while the first ones are not.
Special companies were set up to consult and process this data, which, before acquiring the necessary information from pharmacies, request the patient's approval.
Authorities are already obliged to do so, although they have not received a fine for negligence so far.
Some companies have recently also elaborated the results of laboratory tests and by combining them with drug consumption data they obtain more accurate information about the patient’s state of health.
More and more companies have access to this data and at the same time it is increasingly difficult to control their use.
There is an exclusive law for the protection of personal health data, but it applies only to insurance companies and those providing health services.
The Congress is already facing the bill that gives the authority to control specialized companies for the provision of personal data.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is insufficient: he therefore developed his program, which will require the specific approval of the person for the provision of his own personal data.
It is another matter that such a person cannot deny his approval, because otherwise the insurance companies will not sign the contract with him.
So the chickens, however, are exposed to the good will of the fox.
Global Menu of Marseille
The European Union doubles its trade with India
As the European Union and India are mutually trade partners, this issue, in addition to the other major global issues, dominated the agenda of the ninth summit.
A Franco-Indian summit will also be held today, mainly on cooperation in nuclear energy.
While the European Union recognizes that India is a major developing democratic power that should have more voice and vote in international affairs, the member countries have not yet been able to reach a common denominator on whether to support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
This issue has not been dealt with at the ninth summit initiated yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, EU vice-president José Manuel Barroso, Commission President and Javier Solana, chief foreign policy representative, received Manmohan Singh, India's prime minister, with whom they reached an agreement to duplicate in five years, i.e. increase to more than one hundred billion euros, their trade exchange.
Given that between 2000 and 2007 trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an overly ambitious target.
Thus they legally harmonised the twenty-six existing bilateral civil aviation agreements with India, so that air transport will also be able to fly in the future.
India wants to sign the free trade treaty with the Union until the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up negotiations.
The goal is balance, because while the EU is India’s first trading partner, New Delhi is only in ninth place among the Union’s trading partners.
The summit focused its attention on global issues.
Both sides condemned the Afghan and Pakistani situation and terrorism – all forms of terrorism – and pressed for a UN conference.
The conclusion of the Doha trade liberalization round was also pressed, although both sides had a great responsibility for their failure.
The EU has confirmed that it will stick to its energy and climate programme, i.e. by 2020 it wants to reduce pollutant emissions by at least 20 percent.
India also agrees with this, as at next year’s climate conference, a global agreement should be reached and by 2050 the production of greenhouse gases should be reduced by 50 percent.
They also wanted to hamper the rise in food prices and supported the convening of an international conference to review the financial crisis.
Today, the head of government of India will travel to the French capital, where – at a bilateral meeting – he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris hopes French companies will receive <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 billion in commissions to build nuclear reactors.
According to the news agency, the deal would be for a period of 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the international exhibition of the Frankfurt Book.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will be present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Exhibition expects for this edition more than 7,000 exhibitors from 102 different countries to occupy the 171,790 square meters of the exhibition with more than 403,000 titles on display and with Turkey as an honorary guest.
The Vice-Secretary of the Ministry of Cultural Affairs and Activities, Francisco Maria Giro, will represent the Italian government at the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Pavilion: Italy will be institutionally and effectively present with a point Italy - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will be followed by a press meeting at Room Structur in Hall 5.0 of the Buchmesse: this will be the occasion to present numbers, trends and prospects on the state of publishing houses in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of the books of foreign authors gradually decreases over the total of Italian production, and in particular that for adults and adolescents.
Steve Fossett's plane found the missing millionaire a year ago
The remains of Steve Fossett, the millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada Desert, have been found.
The debris have been found on a 3,000-metre-altitude plateau in the area of the Mammoth Lakes Nevada Sierra, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, there were no human remains.
Wood County Commissioner John Anderson said: "The plane has been located, we have sent a squadron, and now we have the confirmation that it's exactly what Steve Fossett was flying on the day of his disappearance," he said at a press conference.
The commissioner said no human remains were found either on the plane or in the vicinity.
The 63-year-old millionaire was deceased in February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Office (NTSB) has announced that a few hours after sighting the remains, a squad of investigators has been sent to identify the device: it is a Bellanca 8kcab, scattered since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington on a three-hour flight in Nevada.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from the Nevada border, some personal remains of Fossett have been found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with the name Fossett, the two issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and a sweater.
Fossett's search had been interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The millionaire had taken a place in history thanks to a long series of primes.
In 2002, at the sixth attempt, he had become the first Man to complete the world tour in an aerostatic globe: two lonely weeks of flight.
Three years later, he had toured the world by plane and without scales.
Among his records, he may have flew 15,445 meters above the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the Advertising You Don't Expect
A Suv out of the schemes with an original and well-established design with defined lines and certain angles.
This is, in summary, Glk the last born among the all-terrain "compact" vans of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz has sought to give a new window in this sector.
Proper to the outside of the traditional content, it will be unexpected and unconventional, the communication that will accompany the launch of the suv Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz exhibition halls from next October 17.
The advertising campaign that accompanied the debut of the new car launched an unprecedented mode of communication through a 3D advertising campaign, first used in Italy by an automotive brand.
A project with maxi-posters, articulated in three different phases, that will dominate the central street of Milanese shopping, avenue Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic version and thanks to special glasses distributed on the avenue Como it will be possible to see the new suv in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, looking at the images will have the impression that the car comes out of the poster.
Subsequently, through the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, to be recomposed into a single image.
Without a doubt, Mercedes with this advertising is trying to introduce something new to the stereotype of automotive communication.
Will this formula be able to capture the interest of future buyers? we will see.
It is clear who the Italian hooligans are.
In the Triveneto, the ban on access to sporting events is played.
But who are those 150-200 girls and boys of whom Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that has been following the Italian National for years and that until now, to be honest, had never created too many problems.
And they had never met the rival's fans either.
The extraction of the group is on the right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
To these of Sofia have been added a small group (few units, actually) of the Campaign and of Apulia.
They have three-colored flags showing the city of origin of the militants: Saturday night they have been removed so that they are not identified.
They are inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria they have found a group of true Nazi fanatics, those of Levski.
The Figc had made available to Italian fans 144 tickets for the game: all already with the names, making it easy to control.
And the interior minister had already controlled them all: among those who had left for Sofia there was none with a Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) at the time, none who had forbidden him from attending a stadium.
Four Italian fans, who had a history of crime in stadiums, have been denied the ticket and also the trip.
Now the Ministry of the Interior expects to read the events coming from the Bulgarian police to take action: in this case, it is possible to give Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) for at least five years to fans who have been arrested or who have been identified in the disorders.
An international Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) that prevents attendance not only in Italian stadiums but also those throughout Europe.
Our hooligans will no longer stand in a stadium.
Fortunately!.
But now there is the fear of imitation: that to those few fifty others be added.
“We need to immediately extinguish this fire and not legitimize who behaves in this way,” the interior ministry said.
That’s why, “well-eyed” especially in view of Wednesday’s national game in Lecce.”
In Apulia there is also a small core of Ultras Italia supporters.
Tomorrow the Observatory, the Cams, will meet on Tuesday that can also have a section of the Aise (external information and security agency, i.e. the secret service, which handles the problems at the stadiums.
"The Duce-Duce choirs and the arm raised during the Mameli hymn? In Bulgaria it is not a crime ..."
This is the thought (expressed unhappyly) of Domenico Mazzilli, a few weeks ago the director of the Observatory of the Ministry of the Interior (he has taken the post that he was before Francesco Tagliente and after Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had been head of public security in Trieste where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to celebrate the Duce but yes, the behavior of those 150-200 fans that has been shameful.
“I don’t do the sociologist – adds Observatory No. 1 – the reactions are attributed in the countries where the fact occurs.
So far this group has behaved well now we will see what has happened and we will take it into account for the future.
But let’s also talk about the sighs to Mameli’s hymn: those too are not a crime, but if they allow, they are also not of education.
