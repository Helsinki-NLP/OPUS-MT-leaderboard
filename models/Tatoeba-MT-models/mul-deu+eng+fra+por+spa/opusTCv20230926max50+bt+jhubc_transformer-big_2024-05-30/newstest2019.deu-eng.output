The romantic shooting is shown in the video:
DFB chief Grindel sees no basis for <0xC3><0x96>zil-Comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil’s return to the national team.
“This is a question that naturally depends on one coming to a conversation once, on one talking to him about why he apparently felt that one or the other as set out in his statement,” Grindel said in the soccer podcast Phrasenmäher.
Despite months of debate over the photos of <0xC3><0x96>zil with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of 92-time national player <0xC3><0x96>zil.
"I would have been happy if Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed at some point that this would be the case,” Grindel said.
The 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and also justified it by not defending Grindel against racist attacks during the World Cup.
The DFB chief repeated his criticism of <0xC3><0x96>zil that he was not ready for a conversation with Bundestrainer Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He doesn’t want to put pressure on himself, but he knows it from football so that “if you leave a team or change a club, you’re talking to your coach about it and I’m sorry that this conversation hasn’t happened so far.”
Linz: Garden hut burned in Schrebergartensiedlung
At 2.13 p.m., the professional fire department of Linz was alerted to a fire in Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line leads directly over the Schrebergarten settlement, the danger was in delay.
The professional firefighter came out and found the hut in Vollbrand upon arrival.
The roof had to be practically removed to the same extent and fire protection was removed to the extent necessary.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had a battery to charge at noon.
This could possibly be the cause of the fire.
In any case, according to the fire department, the charger was in the area of the highest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire has yet to be determined – as well as the cause of the fire.
However, he is likely to be significant, because the owner had many collectibles in his garden hut.
Angry mother defends herself: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on open road
What has led Lindsay Lohan only to this extremely strange action?
She apparently wanted to bring in the children of an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has even streamed live as she apparently wants to introduce the children to a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the US portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial cut of the stream.
Here you see "Kiss for luck" with Lindsay Lohan
The clip shows Lohan getting out of a carriage and going to a potentially homeless family that she wants to make as a refugee family out of Syria.
As the family runs away from the actress, Lohan chases the parents and their children.
It deals with adult trafficking in children.
There is no evidence for all of this in the clip.
“The whole world sees this right now,” Lohan is heard in the video as she continues to pursue the family along the road.
Apparently, she tries to separate the children from her parents.
At some point, however, the apparently angry mother seems to be enough.
It looks like she turns around and Lohan misses an earring.
Under tears, the actress tells her how shocked she is – and she keeps her mouth shut.
What Lohan has moved to this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "mascot" on the asteroid
The Hayabusa2 probe launched in December 2014 in Japan.
It is designed to get so close to the asteroid Ryugu that it can absorb material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The lander "Mascot" will stay on Ryugu.
Overseas ticker: number of deaths in Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the severe earthquake of magnitude 7.5 and the subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, there are at least 420 deaths.
The number of casualties could go further.
Rescue teams have not yet advanced into the devastated areas and cut off from the outside world.
Elon Musk Resigns as Tesla Supervisory Board Chairman
In the beginning there was a tweet.
Tesla chief executive Elon Musk caused unrest in the stock markets in early August when he announced a withdrawal of the electric car manufacturer.
The U.S. Stock Exchange Authority sued him for fraud, but now both have agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla CEO is retiring from the Supervisory Board, but he can remain the chairman of the board.
Party of the British Conservatives
Sharply guarded - the party day of the Tories
Birmingham becomes the stage of a power struggle.
The party's agenda is to deal with foreign policy, trade and development policy, but the four-day conference overshadows the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, at the forefront Ex-Foreign Minister Boris Johnson.
Referendum on a new state name
The foreign ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing over these namesakes for years.
Now they've agreed.
The state of Macedonia is to be called North Macedonia in the future, and the people will vote on this Sunday - is it all right?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("The Not") - means Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood in the country is split.
Thousands took to the streets in several cities to protest against right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The “Trump of Brazil” appears as an anti-system candidate and is thus at the forefront of the surveys.
His strongest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the Left Workers’ Party.
Audi: ‘Dieselgate’ work will take longer than planned
"The diesel task force is still there," said Peter Mertens, Director of Development, to the automotive weekly newspaper.
In December 2017, Audi chief executive Rupert Stadler announced that the task force would soon be disbanded.
“In the first quarter of 2018, all engine/gear combinations are expected to be tested,” he said.
Mertens said: “In early July, we reached an important milestone in addressing the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analysis of our VTDI engines.
The task force was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at Audi’s Volkswagen mother.
Mertens stressed that the automaker has made "grave organizational changes" so that such a scandal will never happen again.
The VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on Stadler’s future on Friday and wants to discuss further this Tuesday.
The investigating authorities accuse the Audi chief of having authorized the sale of diesel cars with false emission values after the announcement of the emission scams.
He was aware of the manipulations or consciously ignored them.
Bram Schot is currently managing the company as the Chief Executive Officer.
Due to the shift to the new emissions and consumption test standard WLTP, there are production failures at Audi, Shot said.
Basically, he sees a decreasing demand for limousines such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
“The segment itself is difficult,” he said.
Shot relies on electric mobility.
The e-tron, the first Audi electric car, already has 15,000 reservations.
Grindel seeks re-election - Lahm to go to the DFB Presidency
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel wants to run for DFB president again next year, despite criticism of his person after the World Cup and the <0xC3><0x96>zil affair.
“I’m doing my job and trying to make it as good as possible,” Grindel said as a guest in ZDF’s “current sports studio” early Sunday morning.
You have to try again and again for a re-election, that is what I will do.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
In his own words, the head of the association said it would be "marrorous" if he did not "love to collaborate on the future project after the 2024 football match."
Grindel has been the head of the association since April 2016 as a successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, who has fallen over the Summer Marsh affair.
In the autumn of 2016, he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote will be held at the DFB Bundestag on September 27, 2019.
According to Grindel, the future head organizer of the European Championship Philipp Lahm will work in the DFB Presidency.
"I would be happy if my fellow Presidency colleagues agree that he will be advised in this role in the future in the Presidency and then of course warmly invited to provide his experience on sports issues," Grindel said.
He did not want to participate in speculations as to whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB chief.
As a consequence of the affair around the photos of Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in the future a national player without migration background should become the integration ambassador of the DFB.
Currently, this office is exercised by the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter having family roots in Cameroon.
"If a person without a background in migration clearly affects society and football and says, 'the issue is important, we have to take care of it,' that would also be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our local associations where integration needs to work," Grindel said.
Properly lose weight with half-length scale
I have had a new toy for four weeks.
A scale that not only measures my weight but also the body fat content.
Muscle and bone mass can also show it.
The body mass index also calculates the thing, but it is more for the sausages.
Does he not say anything about whether I have replaced fat with muscles?
Basketball Bundesliga: clear record sequence for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin has started with a clear victory in the new season of the Bundesliga.
Against Science City Jena, the vice-champion won easily with 112:55 (52:31) and offered a convincing game over 40 minutes.
Rokas Giedraitis was the top scorer of the dominant Berliners with 20 points.
The Ludwigsburg compulsory national player Johannes Thiemann (18 counters) also showed an attractive performance in front of 9113 spectators during his mandatory debut.
Former champion Brose Bamberg won the mandatory debut of coach Ainars Bagatskis with 84:80 (39:37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was the best pitcher among guests with 24 points.
Würzburg professional Gabriel Olaseni scored 14 points.
Last year’s playoff semi-finalist MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg forced the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt to 83:76 (41:34).
New-National player Karim Jallow was the most successful shooter with 24 points in the team of coach John Patrick.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg started the new season with a clear success.
In the basketball Lions Braunschweig there was a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
The new player Will Cummings outperformed the Oldenburgers with 25 counters.
The Braunschweiger, whose NBA star, Dennis Schröder, has been a majority winner since the beginning of the season, was disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1 run of the baskets quickly provided clear conditions.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an called on the German government to extradite supporters of the Gülen movement living in Germany and to act against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or the Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm the German-Turkish friendship,” he said.
For the opening of the Ditib Mosque, the Cologne city centre had been partially blocked.
Thousands of police officers were in service, including sharpshooters.
The Islamic League Ditib is being criticized for being considered an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music against Poverty: Stars, Storms and Horror Seconds
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have promoted greater engagement in the fight against poverty and disease at a joint concert at New York’s Central Park.
"Engage wherever you can," Mendes said at the festival on the night of Sunday before about 60,000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, that's a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with french and gold microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay, because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives from governments, the United Nations and aid organizations also showed up at the multi-hour performance on stage.
In the meantime, however, there was a moment of horror, when many spectators held the sound of a falling metal block for shots, got scared and tried to escape.
Shortly there was panic, people ran through each other.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, organizer Hugh Evans said.
The New York police and musician Chris Martin calmed the people off the stage.
“No one is trying to hurt anyone,” Martin said.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available for free on the Internet as every year.
Anyone who wanted to find a solution had to read and disseminate texts, photos and videos about the global struggle against poverty and disease on the Internet.
For the numerous musicians and actors, there was the public's cheer and applause - buhrufe on the other hand for Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
He, along with his Democratic colleague Chris Coons, spoke on stage for more equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake had voted on the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge in the Supreme Court, bringing many women to the fore.
At least three women have filed allegations of abuse until the attempted rape of Kavanaugh, which the latter rejects.
Flake demanded an FBI investigation into the allegations after two women, who reportedly experienced sexual assault, confronted him on the way to a committee meeting in an elevator.
"You can also join me in an elevator at any time," Flake told the audience at the concert in New York.
Press Freedom: Federal Government Defends Journalist’s Dismissal
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert has defended the draft of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an.
In the chancellor's office, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had worn a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone to the first row.
The T-shirt, if not the problem, said Seibert in the picture on Sunday.
It was a disturbance in the course of the press conference.
The journalist’s actions caused a lot of unrest, which was unacceptable.
That's why he's caused the person's protectors to take the man out.
Seibert said it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellor’s office.
This is entirely true regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, many journalists are in prison.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage or support or membership in banned parties or the Fethullah-Gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership is responsible for the failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists are facing decades of imprisonment.
Even foreign journalists are unsure of the Turkish authorities: It was not until early September that the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
Lastly, the cases of the detained journalists Me<0xC5><0x9F>ale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had given rise to detention.
They came free and were able to return to Germany, but there are still trials against the two in Turkey.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
So fresh and well-looking his fans usually know him: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look at it twice: yes, that's really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht" produced by the NDR is known for damp conversations at the table of the Hamburg harbour cafe "Schellfischposten".
Moderator Ina Müller meets with her guests on some beer, some wine or even high-percent drinks to unlock the mood and tongues.
Not a few vows also drink courage for the mandatory singing inserts.
On Friday, another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time, the actor Florian David Fitz is known from films such as "Men's Hearts", "Terror - Your Judgment" or "The Happiest Day".
The Municher did not get the trip to the high north at all.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely scratched on it, the eyes only two small slots.
The bed selfie shows a fully equipped Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he just has a powerful cat.
Directed to his fans, he posted some – probably not quite serious – findings that he has now gained: “Rule one: Never go to Inas Night.
Rule two: Never drink the black sauce.
And syringe.
And the round ovarian liqueur, which Ina throws at three and a half, also leaves away.
Alcohol consumption is really in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans immediately posted some tips on how to fight backfires.
They range from instant bruises, fish breads or - probably the most targeted - headache pills.
Others simply enjoyed the view of the normally attractive cinema star.
As to how Ina Müller survived the night-time sausage, it is not known yet.
Since she has been moderating the TV fun at the desk since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to have been clearly tested.
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to deal with vandalism and unrest
The entry into the 36-kilometre-long cycling trail in the Red Cape country in Treysa is difficult to find and is rubbish.
Recipes against grassy vandalism are sought, but solutions are barely characteristic.
Sharpening, cigarette chickens, garbage and unrat, demolished garbage bins and now dismantled signposts - this is how has been presented since long since the start of the trip with a group of seats to the bike path on the Haaße hill in Treysa.
For the display object, the railway bicycle path in the Red Capeland is a more than unfathomable view.
The topic has been occupying members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt, but also others for a long time, according to the city’s cycling commissioner Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem has already been addressed in the Bicycle Traffic Board.
There is no solution so far.
The proposals range from the placement of the seat group to regular emptying of the waste tanks and cleaning of the areas at the starting point.
"I think the latter would be the order of the hour - regardless of possible further activities," says Desert Hagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the topic has also been included in the local council.
Not only does the garbage drive cyclists and residents around - the seating group is a regular meeting point for celebration on weekends.
Not only does it often sound loud, the shelves are also destroyed: poles are torn from the ground, garbage bins are demolished, signs are rebuilt, seating furniture is lubricated.
Volunteers had already cleaned up more often, said ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
But the actions are just the literal drops on the hot stone.
They are upset that the resting place on the bike path in Treysa is the meeting point for sampling.
"Along the entire cycle path, the focus here is clearly on the Haaße hill", confirms the bicycle traffic officer, who now also takes care of the new bicycle site in Ziegenhain, which will be opened today.
"If she misses the same fate, it's going to be really expensive".
Another idea is a video surveillance on the hill: "Maybe that raises the threshold of accessing the community.
However, this would assume that a police streak would pass in time.
In principle, Desert Hagen wants a development of the Haaße hill.
It must be made more attractive.
In fact, it is possible to be very satisfied with the frequency of the cycle path so far.
Tourism marketing is still expanding.
Our bike path is very high quality compared to others in Germany," said the ADFC members.
As an extremely critical threat point, ADFC member Susanne Klippert appreciates the situation in the Ascheröder Straße in Treysa.
There is no slope on the haaße hill.
With regular traffic, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between both sides of traffic flow,” she explains.
This is not a problem for sports drivers, but for the elderly and especially for children.
Music contest at the Kulturbahnhof: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and collaborative.
"D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the city-offensive Hiltrup, in the "Music Contest for large and small, young and experienced musicians".
A contest "with eyebrows in the sympathetic helper family", as Karl Franke formulated.
In fact, it was soon a family friendly coffee and cake from the cultural train station’s volunteers.
Seven formations joined, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long-lived Albachtener, the nine of the "Hiltruper sternfarben", three members of the "Hiltruper stern", and three children from the family's three-legged C.
This contest, said district mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a novelty.
We have not seen this in other parts of the city.
What did the lyrics relate to?
At the sites, the help trooper lake and the market alley were particularly frequently mentioned.
Rolf Ihmig shortened the alley in his hit song to "Kö von Hiltrup".
The cultural train station was also honored.
Again and again, it was about experiencing each other in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short remodeling breaks with short interviews with the interpreters or hints on their creation.
This was how Humberg learned that he had actually studied chemistry, but now he also taught guitar.
From the sound technician Stefan Schemmelmann, Franke was able to report that he recently performed in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
Alvin Jasic has posted on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Auxiliary Troop Gastronomy.
However, there was something special for the jury’s favorites – so that others could listen to their songs.
A whole CD can be played by Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with sound technician Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup-Schlag, which impressed Franke particularly with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very nice performance" with ten children and two guitar and cajon educators, Laura Kastllener and Lina Tödel.
Like all of them, the children also showed up for the final once again – and even without electronic support sounded “very good,” as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, entry of the melody and recognition value.
The jury was attended by Gisbert Keller of the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß of the KvG Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers of the Federation of Economics, and Jan Kaven, chairman of the municipal offensive.
The city’s offensive had triggered the event on the occasion of its ten-year existence.
She valued the event as a complete success.
Everyone was "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in game test
The players make up two teams that face each other.
For each page, there is a display of four cards with keywords that you can decipher - the old trick with the red foil - only after you have entered them.
This ensures that the other side can’t accidentally read anything.
On the maps, for example, read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
2. Window.
3. Cube.
4. Fest".
These are the terms that need to be encrypted.
It is not the terms that should be guessed here, but the codes.
Alternately, one player per team is the encryptor.
He gets a code card that may be "3.4.2".
Advise in "Decrypto" not the terms behind the secret film, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: he should - in this order and in this example - describe the terms "wreck", "fest" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team as much as possible not; for that is what the game wins if it gets to him twice, after all.
So the encryptor notes and reads out loud: "toss" for the dice, "Lose" as opposed to Fest; here, of course, something like "party" and "prag" would be possible because he has been careful in the school and knows the window collapse there.
This is how it goes round for round, team for team.
Although one does not know the terms of the opposite side - but they can be better combined with any hint given by the encryptor there.
As mysterious as possible, but not too distracted should be the rewrites, otherwise you make it unnecessary difficult for your team.
The most cryptic of "Decrypto" is, unfortunately, the rulebook.
Players will probably have to study it quite long and in-depth until they can finally play.
The explanation video at decrypto.info on the net makes it easier.
But those who have first started will be fascinated by how much emotion lies in this unlikely game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not as crucial as its predecessor and genre-primus "codenames", which also helps an agent theme to play less words, but it is much better to play in small groups.
And for those who are only talking about ratings and not winning points, they can also easily find a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows Hitler's greeting to police and harassing guests at the cafe
A 48-year-old man employed the Kulmbach Police Inspectorate twice as much on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
He first showed Hitler's greetings in the upper city of a passing police streak, then later he also appeared in a bar in the upper city when he harassed other guests.
Since he was clearly alcoholic and did not comply with the police’s mandate, he had to spend the night at the Kulmbach Police Inspectorate in the prison cell.
In a state of nudity, he must also be liable criminally for the use of badges of unconstitutional organizations.
Pressig was the home of the Schublok
The railway plant in Pressig was for decades the rotary disk in the Frankenwald.
In 1991, a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffers knocked on buffers, they heard it in a rush," recalls Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station.
That didn't excite anyone.
The brakes were quiet and the wagons were scratching.
It was a pure railway.
Statements that symbolically represent Dinkel’s Home Pressure.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so marked by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the Steilrampen mountain range to the north, which, after a rise of about 220 meters, has its focal point in Steinbach am Wald.
To cope with this, former train and push-blocks were needed, which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway workshop with 21 locomotives, apprenticeships, driving and railway mastery.
“The heartpiece was the rotary disc that had a diameter of 18 meters after a reconstruction in 1899,” says Norbert Heidrich of Hirschaid, a railway historian and 47-year-old professional railroader.
From Pressig railway station (BW), which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968, locomotives were also operated for the side lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight Elloks were stationed in Pressig at the time.
The electrification of the track in 1939 already minimized the need for train and push-blocks.
From 1977 they were only used in freight trains.
By 1991, at least 10,000 wagons were registered per month.
Parts of the plant were discontinued in 1982, the rest were discontinued in 1991.
Heidrich: "It is unfortunate that we have not considered a better use of the site, even in terms of freight traffic."
Even at Pentecost 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated a pompous train station festival in Pressig for the anniversary of "50 years of electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld".
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," recalls Georg Dinkel.
A little later that out.
On 1 June 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, the Rangierbahnhof Pressig was history.
"The Rangers and Hemmschuhlers did the most difficult jobs in train traffic," recalls Dinkel.
Any mistake would have had fatal consequences.
Why the station Pressig-Rothenkirchen has led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many more historical and current images can be found here in the infraredPlus article.
Kerber with recorder success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round at the Beijing Tennis Tournament as Julia Görges had before.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against Frenchman Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent of the world rankings third is either Julia Putinzewa from Kazakhstan or the Spanish Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegemund scored 6:3, 4:2 against Darja Kassatkina, when the Russian nominated at number 13 gave up.
The Swabian is now dealing with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
As part of the series "Art and Enjoyment", a special exhibition was opened in Mittelherenbach on the weekend.
With great relief, registered organizers and visitors looked at the ideal weather when the Special Vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the outdoors of the property Dahlmann- Schmidt, Mittehrenbach.
It takes place under the roof of the Tourism Association "Round around Walberla" as part of the series "Art and Enjoyment".
It opened its doors in the 15th year.
A large visitor’s appeal showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists are now to be visited in Mittelhehrenbach.
Hausherr Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the Vernissage.
He has been there since the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who also made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist.
Surprisingly, he announced his resignation a few days ago.
But with Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, he put his task in proven, young hands with a good future perspective.
In the past, both artists have already participated actively in the selection of artists and co-designed flyers.
Also this year, on the occasion of Kunst & Genuss, there is again a 70-cent special stamp designed by them, available at each art station.
This year's poster "Betzn austanzen", designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased with the high privilege of the special exhibition.
For the musical frame, Max Marcus Stadler was able to win from Nuremberg.
As you walk through the generous garden, the visitor quickly realizes that the title "wind game performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately playfully expresses it.
They are works of art made of metal or ceramic, often with colorful accents.
Already at the entrance of the property, the visitor is waiting on the right side of the "luck tree" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree trunk, colorfully illuminated, playfully equipped with 20 wind wheels, 24 hoofs and 24 aluminum tubes as a sound piece.
With the sun shining through the bushwork in the background, the object looks fairy-tale and invites to stay.
Barbara Washneck is from Eckental, who prefers to dedicate 15 years of K&G in three-dimensional letters to the event.
There are many parts moving in the wind.
On the half way, Siegrid Frey from Eckental exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his thin imagination of tone, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Windspiel-Performance" is to stroll through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited until 31 December 2018.
50 years MGV 68 Albachten: singers celebrate 50th birthday festively
1968 - this was the time of protest and student movement.
And the Albanians also breathed their anger at that time.
At least five of them.
They did not want to find themselves everywhere with the fact that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cecilia" there should be no more singing life in the district.
It has now become a legend: At a bank in Tintenbusch they raise the MGV 68 Albachten from baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated largely in the "house of the encounter".
"It will be full today," Jürgen Holsteige said, and he should be right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albanian singers.
On the occasion of the anniversary, they had revived the foundation party.
For years it was a tradition, and then there was a break.
On the occasion of the 50th anniversary, the tradition festival was there again.
An elegant ball was asked to wear festive clothes before.
The guests were not sitting as usual in the "House of Meeting" in seating rows, but cozy at tables.
In the meantime, movement was said: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln drew the controllers and asked for the dance floor.
It is an honor that the singers of the MGV 68 Albachten themselves made their voices heard.
Suitable for the occasion, happy songs were made.
Almost already put: "Like a day, as beautiful as today".
Suitable for the exquisite grape juice that many had before them, there was the "Rüdesheimer wine".
In reference to another cool drink, "Humulus lupulus", which is the Latin name for "hope".
Again, the choir leadership was sovereign by Richard Homann, who is one of the five who were in the Tintenbush at the time.
"It's just fun to sing under his leadership," said Waldsteige: "He has such a light way, it's a masterpiece that he performs." By the way, this time not only men presented themselves with singing.
The women's choir "Hohes C" was also a guest whose repertoire covers mainly Evergreens from the 20s to the 60s.
Finally, there was poetry.
Singer Theo Weber had sat at the desk until three o’clock in the morning to create his own remake.
And also Andreas Winterhoff presented well-sunging poetry.
There was also a large tombola.
The proceeds are intended to finance the children of the Albatros Youth Center a visit to the All-weather Zoo.

Volleyball: 3rd Women's League: USC II wins high-class derby against BW Aasee
The Ascendant is marching.
Three games, three wins - the reserve of the USC Münster under the patronage of Axel Büring is quite right in league three.
No trace of squirrels or chickpeas, the independents do their thing.
And that at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city competitor BW Aasee quite well.
"It wasn't clear, but we've already left an impression," says the somewhat satisfied coach.
BWA coach Kai Annacker immediately added: "This is a defeat with which we can live very well.
We are not dissatisfied." On the contrary.
In the evening, at a subsequent birthday party by Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game was cut off.
Yes, the result is actually an optical deception.
In the third set, the guests had a set ball.
"If they get to the goal, a game like this can kick," says Büring from years of experience.
Finally, the USC, with its routine forces, clarified everything and brought the full exploitation to the target.
“We are all aware of who is on the other side in such a derby.
That doesn't break our genius.
I saw really good volleyball in stages," Annacker did not have the 0:3 - and immediately went on to the agenda.
Wherever the trip goes for the independents, after just three days of play, it seems unpredictable.
“It’s just too early,” says Axel Büring.
Only in one he feels confirmed: “The 3rd League has an incredibly good level.
This is not nearly comparable with regional league volleyball." In the fourth league, they no longer want to look downwards.
If the vests are not dirty in the coming weeks, they need to look up.
However, a first balance sheet can only be drawn after 10, 11 games.
On Saturday we will only go to Emlichheim.
Aasee arrives in Essen on October 14.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "dream ship" Heide Keller became the star.
Now she is speaking openly that the series may have had a complicity in her marriage to Hans von Borsody.
Her role as chief host Beatrice von Ledebur on the "dream ship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018 she left for good.
The series that made her star could be co-responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she had been married for ten years.
"That could also have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, traveled with a suitcase alone around the world, and many of my admired colleagues took me on eye level,” Keller told the Sunday Image.
At first she was always "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that changed with the "dream ship".
Because now the journalists only called at Heide Keller.
"I don't know if he liked it so much."
She considers it possible that her husband at the time might have been quite jealous, but "as many men also shuddered Hans' conversations about problems and feelings."
Keller has always tried to be the only one right for Hans von Borsody and he didn’t want to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I have moved," she explains.
She has always had the feeling of “not being good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman that I never really was, even though I sometimes appeared on stage ugly and brave.
I wanted our love to be forever.”
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller once again said yes, "although I was afraid it could go wrong a second time."
The day before the official wedding, I sat in the wardrobe and wanted to cancel everything.
Borsody's marriage also failed.
Why hasn't it ever worked with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller imagined the love at the time "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not everyday.
I’ve been too naive about love.”
The night fold, who regularly explores the city’s nightlife in the NZZ resort Zürich, dared this time to the ZFF opening party.
Our fold is not a motto, but a little light.
And the gritty glow in which a green carpet is immersed on the hexagonal square blinds it over fee.
But it’s a film festival, because more or less celebrities want to sunbathe in the light of the headlights.
So on this late Thursday night, he drowns over the square to relax briefly in the "Aquaclean toilet oasis".
This is the name of the public toilet facility sponsored by a large sanitary company, which celebrates its premiere at the festival: The needs facility on the ground floor of a new pavilion makes a lot of effort to streamline a luxurious ambience.
On that evening, however, in the men's oasis, for some reason, it smells like heaven.
So out here, on the other side of the street: invited guests who have just entertained at the cinema next to the opening film "Green Book" at the best level, celebrate the festival with a party in the three-storey warehouse like every year.
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival: from all over the globe the works shown are known.
What do you need to keep in mind in an article about this festival, not to fall into disguise for its 190 partner companies.
The fold binds a ribbon around the sensors, which has given him a good fee, and two bullish doorkeepers actually wink him in generously.
Inside, the guests push themselves, dance long after midnight to live music, or play DJ rhythms to shout to each other, and rinse up exquisite cuffs with Cüpli.
In the delicatessen shop in the subterranean, oysters are waiting for swirling mouths, next to the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut, a chocolate fountain sprouts.
And the hammer is: all the sales shelves full of exclusive products have not been cleared for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without major losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The folder studies the sign on the roller staircase: "Wear a long dress, please be careful on the roller staircase".
Should that be two separate instructions, he's lost himself in the dress code.
But it is rather a conditional construction, and it has certainly already saved lives.
In the household goods department on the upper floor, the poultry picks up a cocktail prepared with espresso called "Golden Eye", matching the festival award.
The price for the best drink will not be compulsory for this mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself.
And George Clooney, who has been advertising for that brand for years, is not here in the evening either.
But between local prominence, cash table and kitchen items, there is a face that appears familiar to the observer: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His main character should not be far away.
And really: Viggo Mortensen, with nearly sixty years of age acting like a choir boy, walks through the crowd.
He's not being caught, he's not being given, he's being bullied.
Especially for this restraint, liked to be misunderstood as cramping, international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with Cumbia dancers
Trainer and former football star Diego Maradona is delighted with the victory of his team.
Argentine football legend Diego Maradona seems to have lived well in his new home in Mexico.
After a 2-0 victory for his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the cabin to Cumbia rhythms, as can be seen in a video released on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member, Maradona dances in a yellow shirt, fired by the players.
The Mexican second-place finisher defeated the Leones Negros by 2-0 on Saturday.
After the game, Maradona called a TV camera "Always with my boys, always".
The 57-year-old has been training the Mexican club since early September.
Handball: League 1: U.S. sends after last-minute talks "destroyed on the ground"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the ASV handball league, could barely grasp it: "So a bitter defeat". His defenders were "destroyed on the ground" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - pleite - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday night at LIT Germania 2.
They had not played badly - as in stone hares, as in the case of Hüllhorst - over wide phases, the transmitters.
Only the initial phase "we have completely slept", the ASV coach was upset.
Quickly the housekeepers led by 8:1, even the early break that Bieletzki had taken did not bear fruit at first.
"But then suddenly a backup went through the team," Bieletzki summed up the second quarter-hour.
At the time of the break, the rest was only two gates.
Most of all, Sending Best, Marius Hintze, met in the phase a different time.
After the change, it became even better from the visitor’s perspective.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst scored 15:15, then the season changer performed almost all the time.
Four minutes before the Sirene, the lead was still three reassuring hits (29:26).
And then?
Get the impartials into action.
Bieletzki is usually careful not to look for guilt with others.
But: The 120-second time penalty that Steffen Mühlhoff paid was "a joke".
LIT had a good laugh and hit the end four more times - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys fought great, stood well against seven men in the back and threw again and again at the empty gate.
You can only buy little for the compliments.
"Now a goddamn victory must come," said the relentless servant Bieletzki.
USA gates: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hunging (1).
Bavaria: Woman Missing for 30 Years - Police Buried for Body Parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of an 18-year-old girl from Naila (county court), police search for the woman’s remains.
On Saturday, the marx-greens dug a street.
To do this, the street covering and several layers of it were laid down, as the police and the prosecution jointly communicated.
According to new findings, the missing may not have been buried far from their then residence.
The woman has been missing since November 4, 1986.
The investigators did not exclude a crime at the time.
Since last year, the Criminal Police Court has been working closely with the prosecutor’s office on the case again.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Monumental Protection Authority, the investigators encountered a spotlight under the road at Marxgrün by means of a ground radar.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officials bordered the place on a few meters.
The results of the excavations should be announced during the afternoon.

Elon Musk, the founder of electric car manufacturer Tesla, has stepped down from his threatening resignation as head of the billion-dollar company.
He and the U.S. Stock Exchange Supervisory Authority SEC filed an extrajudicial dispute over misleading Twitter messages, in which Musk could have lost permission to run listed companies.
As part of the comparison, Musk and Tesla pay <0x24>20 million each, and Musk assumes the post of chairman for three years, a position comparable to that of the German supervisory board.
However, the Chief Executive may remain.
In the comparison, which still has to be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted misconduct.
The SEC had sued the world-renowned manager before the U.S. federal court in Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, also headed by SpaceX, is the public face of the losing electric car pioneer, now valued at more than <0x24>50 billion on the stock exchange.
Musk is not aware of any guilt.
Musk explained that he had done nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed with the lawsuit.
He has always acted in the sense of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk wrote to his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he might take the company from the stock exchange and pay <0x24>420 per share, the funding being secured.
That would have rated Tesla at <0x24>72 billion.
Later, Musk turned back: Tesla stays on the stock market.
After the agreement, Tesla must now find a chairman from outside, appoint two independent board members, and also set up a committee that monitors Musk’s communications.

After that, the Klopp team missed the match several times.
National player Antonio Rüdiger cleared after a solo from Liverpool goalkeeper Mohamed Salah on the line (31st).
Shortly before the end, Sturridge redeemed the Reds with a sniper in the corner.
Manchester United's record-breaking record-breaking team is falling deeper into the crisis after the worst season start since 1989.
The team of controversial coach José Mourinho lost to West Ham United by 1:3 (0:2) and remains in the midfield only with ten points after seven days of play.
The pressure on Mourinho will continue to grow ahead of the Champions League match against FC Valencia on Tuesday.
Former Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno came to his first Premier League debut after an injury to Petr Cech.
Before the Champions League game at 1899 Hoffenheim on Tuesday, Manchester City won by goals from Raheem Sterling (29th) and Sergio Agüero (65th) 2:0 against Brighton&Hove Albion.
Leroy Sané prepared 1-0, Ilkay Gündogan did not get used to the new top rider.
"Let's Dance" Juror Joachim Llambi and Mrs Ilona Separated
Joachim Llambi must have separated from his wife Ilona.
The dance expert has become famous through the RTL show "Let's Dance".
After 13 years of marriage, Joachim Llambi (54) and his wife Ilona (45) are now separated.
The "image on Sunday" reports, referring to Llambi's lawyer, about the separation of the well-known moderator and dance expert.
"Our clients have separated unanimously and friendlyly," Christian-Oliver Moser, a lawyer, told BamS.

Survey: 46% don’t want Merkel as Chancellor by 2021
After the cross-sections of the past weeks, GroKo is collecting several survey depths.
The SPD falls behind the AfD in an interview - Angela Merkel is seen critically.
Berlin - The AfD has for the first time outdated the SPD in the Emnid Sunday trend for the image on Sunday.
In the weekly poll of the opinion research institute, the AfD adds a counter to 17 percent, the SPD scores a point compared to the previous week and lands at 16 percent.
CDU and CSU are also losing a counter and only 27 percent.
This is the deepest value for the Union in the Sunday trend so far.
The Greens reach 15 percent, the Left 11 and the FDP 10 percent.
If it were a Bundestag election on Sunday, the government parties SPD, CDU and CSU would get only 43 percent of the votes together, Emnid said.
As a result, the major coalition has now lost the majority in all major research institutes – except Allensbach – on the Sunday issue.
The ruling parties account for 43 to 45 percent of the vote (Allensbach: 51 percent).
In the 2017 Bundestag elections, they received a total of 53.4 percent.
With the other parties, the bandwidth is also large: the AfD, the second-most-strongest party in several polls, reaches 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens have a voting share of 12.5 to 17%.
The left is 10 percent on average, the FDP is 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such surveys, depending on the percentage of votes, have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down.
But the retention for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has also declined significantly since the 2017 Bundestag election.
Currently, only 48 percent of citizens find that Merkel is the right person in the Chancellor’s office, according to the Emnid poll on behalf of the BamS.
Only one in two (50 per cent) currently want the big coalition to hold the next regular federal parliamentary election in three years, and 41 per cent are in favour of a new election.
In a further survey published on Saturday, there were also significant popularity penalties for Merkel.
Divided, the Germans also assessed whether Merkel should run for the CDU presidency again in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are in favour, 44 percent are against.
Accordingly, 64 per cent of EU supporters do not want a candidate, 35 per cent do not.
Hanging at Aldi: Reduced to love happiness
Is Aldi going to be Tinder 2.0?
Who says there are no more romantic acquaintance stories in Tinder's time - it should talk about puppet meat at Aldi.
Munich - In times of the digital "fast food dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket as a place of acquaintances for the great love almost radiates an anachronistic romance.
Yes, right, talking about reduced puppy meat, boxershort snacks at the table or the favorite pudding is still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The Tinder app is called to be less a contact, but rather a slippery exchange.
We dared the test: How do women react, you didn’t talk about the hot bream for a long time in the first message?
Here is the amazing result.
Regular Hollywood-lovestory potential has it when love luck precedes an out-of-the-eyes-lost and-recovered plot.
If the guy still contacts his friends at the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch<0x40>gmx.de, that sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and Consorts - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So it is the author of this ad in an Aldi branch that we don’t know how to wish she would find her dream man, with whom she had a brief conversation about the “30 percent reduced organic poultrymeat”.
For her belief in the magic of analogue learning, she certainly deserved her Happy End à la Hollywood.
Imagerbeck: 500 lids for a life without paralysis
Since the beginning of the new school year, the Ludger School has participated in the action "Cover against polio - 500 covers for a life without childbirth".
Polio is the abbreviation for poliomyelitis, an infectious disease caused by poliovirus.
The disease referred to in German as childhood paralysis leads from paralysis phenomena to death.
In Germany, polio is considered eradicated, but there are three other countries worldwide where the disease occurs.
The cause of poliomyelitis, the polioviruses, can only be inhibited by vaccinations, as stated in a press release.
Football: Reus and Zorc demand peace for idols
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB Sports Director Michael Zorc and Captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public discussion on form and fitness by Mario Götze.
“We should stop thinking about Mario.
That's not good for the boy.
And that’s not good for us,” said the idol-friendly Reus after a 4:2 win in Leverkusen on TV broadcaster Sky.
Zorc had already emphasized before the game.
For him personally, this is not an easy situation.
Football: Eberl: No hurry in contract talks with Hecking
Mönchengladbach (dpa) - Manager Max Eberl of the football Bundesliga Borussia Mönchengladbach is not in a hurry to renew his contract with coach Dieter Hecking.
We have not even talked about a treaty so far.
There is no fixed date when we do this.
"But there will certainly be a moment when we sit down and talk," Eberl told Sky on Sunday night.
Football: District League: VfL Wolfbeck’s appearance against SC Altenrheine makes courage
There were moments in this still young season, when Alois Fetsch went to court with his hard.
Wortkarg, coach of the football district manager VfL Wolbeck, resigned (inner) for the first time to reflect on the lack of performance on the green.
It's all history.
In the meantime, it is running again around the Brandhoveweg.
Taufrischer Evidence is the 1:1 match against SC Altenrheine on Sunday, in the past game only half-finned over the ascent.
Yes, I am very satisfied with the performance.
"We have tightened the spaces and put pressure on the ball.
That could be seen," Fetsch praised his boys and looked up at each individual for the game to simply say "thank you" for so much counter-army against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to change the system after 26 minutes.
After the injury to Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him came Luca Rehberg - it went from 4-4-2 almost seamlessly to a 4-2-3-1, in which Niklas Thewes waited for balls in front.
Wolbeck had a lot more play in the first half.
And chances.
But Frerichs before his ex (17th), the alternate Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
Almost that would have been the case when the SCA hit Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbaumer dangerously twice in person in the 41st minute – Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his field.
After the break, the VfL often took full control.
Thewes from 18 meters nearly failed.
Schroer also came late after 58 minutes at a Thewes input.
With the replacement of Miles Geske, the fat on the left side missed a fresh cell cure again.
When Altenrhein Chris Naberbaumer fell in the 70th minute Robin Westhues, there was an indirect free kick for the square doors 18 meters in front of the guest house.
The robber came on his own and demonstrated his dangers at standards.
Westhues" Thing with the right slap hit down left from the shooter's view - 1:0 (71.).
Twenty more minutes, which should be damn long.
And then that: VfL captain Florian Quabeck in the 80th minute, the leather in the prison room unhappyly flew to his hand.
Arbitrator Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not let the gift go away (79.).
In the final phase, Wolfbeck had to survive a terrible few minutes before Geské had the victory in the 87th minute from 12 meters.
Maybe it would have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75th Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26th L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66th Geske) - Thewes

Eintracht Frankfurt wins 4-1 against Hannover 96
Starting position: Four points after five days of play - that was not enough for coach Adi Hütter.
Against Hannover 96, Eintracht Frankfurt finally wanted to secure the first home win.
Stormman Ante Rebic, who was first in the start elf after an injury, should help.
Midfielder Luca Torró was also back after a sponge injury and should with his headball strength prevent the SGE from cashing other goals according to standards.

Helicopter crashed in Kottingbrunn
At the landing, there was an accident at the airport.
The four passengers were slightly injured.
Around 2:00 p.m. there was a drama at the Kottingbrunn airport on Sunday.
When a helicopter landed, turbulence occurred, as the police confirmed to oe24.
The helix was captured by a windbow, smashed to the ground, and later fell to the ground.
Police, rescue and firefighters were immediately heard.
With a large bid, the deployment forces came to the point of disaster.
The <0xC3><0x96>AMTC emergency helicopter was also called for caution.
Inmates only slightly injured
Fortunately, everything turned out to be largely harmless.
There is only one damage.
The four occupants were only slightly injured and were able to return home independently.
The exact circumstances of the accident have not yet been clarified and are the subject of investigations.
According to fire spokesman Franz Resperger, there was a small forming fire, which, however, could be quickly erased again.
Allbright Foundation report: Women remain a rarity in corporate boards
As a result, only 8 per cent of the board members were female on September 1st, according to the report "The Power of Monoculture", which will be officially presented by the Allbright Foundation on Monday and submitted in advance to the German Press Agency.
“The companies will have to set up differently, otherwise the international competitors will pass on to them,” said Stiftungs Managing Director Wiebke Ankersen.
In the U.S., UK or Sweden, purely male-occupied leadership teams – with few exceptions – are no longer conceivable.
The residue makes the German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and forward-looking.
It is another corporate culture.
The slight increase in the share of women among German stock exchange companies is also due only to positive impulses in the mid-size index (MDax) companies.
According to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of board members are female.
In the previous year, however, the value was still 3.8 percent.
In the 30 Dax companies - pioneers in recent years - the proportion of women has stagnated.
Last year, 26 women worked in the board of directors.
“I’m sure the Dax companies will recruit more consistent women next year – in their own interest,” Ankersen said.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement would have signaled no commitment to continue to increase the share of “zero percent” so far.
Another picture is given by the Supervisory Boards: as of September 1, the proportion of women was 30.5 percent - 45 more women and 68 less men than even a year ago.
"If you recruited as many women to the board of directors every year, you would have reached 40 percent in 2023," the report said.
Some even make Miese: Luxury cars: Which manufacturer earns the most per car?
Ferrari deserves the best.
The Italians take in <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>280,000 with each Ferrari sold and make <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>69,000 operating profit.
Big cars, big profits: This slogan still applies today - in most cases.
Who among the noble providers makes the most profit per car?
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do the luxury car manufacturers pay for each car they sell?
"Autopapst" and economics professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer have dealt with this question.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
Ferrari made <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>69,000 operating profit with each car sold in the first half of the year - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only comes to about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>800, Tesla and Bentley even put a lot of weight on each car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well in the race with prices of an average of 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros of profit before interest and taxes EBIT.

For the 60th time, the association organizes the wine festivals, which continue to rise every Saturday in October in the large party tent on Rehweiler Straße.
At the start of the jubilee, the responsible people moved to the venue under the sounds of the playman train from Wiesenbronn.
The chairman of the Tourism Association, Wolfgang Starz, Mayor Jürgen Schulz and Wine Princess Lisa Kursawe welcomed the guests in the already crowded party tent. "60 years to address something like this - this is a crazy achievement for a small place with 800 inhabitants.
You can be proud of it," Starz thanked all the helpers.
Wine Princess Lisa II later met symbolically with the guests from the stage.
"Glad so many people have found their way back to us after Abtswind." Later, "The Troglauer" provided mood.
On Sunday, which was also celebrated by the Abtswinder Kirchweih, on the occasion of the anniversary, the association had fixed the beverage prices as it was 60 years ago.
A party evening for the 60th wine festival takes place on Friday, 5 October, in the guest’s house, before going to the second round a day later in the party tent.
In Bonn: Notarzt car power in taxi
A ambulance is severely damaged next to a road.
A 27-year-old passenger was fatally wounded in the collision of the utility vehicle with a taxi.
When emergency doctors are called, they are supposed to help – best of all, save lives.
Such a rescue journey in Bonn took a deadly end for a 26-year-old.
Bonn - A 26-year-old pedestrian was fatally injured in a collision with a taxi in Bonn.
The taxi driver, the ambulance doctor and their drivers were severely injured, police said.
The 46-year-old driver of the Notarztauto had crossed a red light with blue light and Martinshorn on Saturday afternoon.
He then met at a crossroads with the taxi that drove to Green.
After the collision, the doctor's car slipped against a lamppost and a tree.
He captured the passenger who died at the scene of the accident.
Driver of emergency car and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the emergency car were severely wounded in their vehicles and had to be released from service.
The also seriously injured 29-year-old emergency doctor was able to free herself, but the pedestrian was no longer able to help her.
Another recalled notarist tried this - but without success.
The three injured were taken to hospitals.
The police are investigating in close consultation with the Bonner Public Prosecutor's Office who is responsible for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we are uncomfortable
Manchester United are now losing in the 7th round of the Premier League.
West Ham United are subject to ManU 1:3. The way the defeat is supposed to be spoken.
The scene was symbolic in the 74th minute in which the recovered Marko Arnautovic shot for West Ham 3:1; just three minutes after Marcus Rashford allegedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
As they suspected an offside at the Mark Nobel pass, all Manchester defenders stood, leaving Arnautovic all the time in the world to pass the ball on helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative highlight of a previously inadequate performance over a wide range.
At the moment, United's city rival Manchester City is very different.
Mourinho's big competitor Pep Guardiola coached citizens came against Brighton & Hove Albion to an undamaged 2-0 win.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling for the home team for the first time broke the defense bar of the outsider.
After a good hour and a double pass with the former goalkeeper, Sergio Agüero secured the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer a table leader
Three days after a 1–2 defeat in the League Cup, Xherdan Shaqiri faced Liverpool in the Premier League 1–1 against Chelsea.
As with the cup-out, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man among the Londoners.
The hit of the 27-year-old in the 25th minute remained until the end of the game's only hit.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, almost missed the match after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge made it better in the 89th minute with his sniper.
After the Reds started the week with a flawless balance, Chelsea were not to beat for the second time.
At first, the Londoners eliminated Jürgen Klopp's team in the Cup, and by the remis in the league, the Blues also dropped Liverpool from the top of the table.
Like City, the two London City clubs celebrated Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) 2–0 wins.
The fans of the Gunners who played Granit Xhaka, however, had to tolerate the surprise team from the county of Hertfordshire until the 81st minute for a message of success.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart unhappy Alex Iwobi’s entry into his own goal, just two minutes later Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil made the decision with his third season defeat.
Arsenal went past Watford for the fifth consecutive win and is just behind the big rival Tottenham in the 5th position. A strong impression continues to leave Wolferhampton under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained unmatched for the fifth consecutive time in a 2-0 match against Southampton in the league and finished in 8th place.
VW Core Brand Missing: Paris Auto Show in Sign of Diesel Debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially not a topic, but all the while: The diesel scandal and the ringing about driving bans and re-equipment should not let the German automotive companies go, even at an industry meeting in Paris.
At the 2018 Motor Show, they will showcase their innovations next week together with the competition from around the world in the French capital.
The diesel doesn’t really play a big role anymore.
The possible exchange and retrofit offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are still to be negotiated with the government in Berlin by then, however, are still expected to be an important topic at least behind the shiny scenes of the exhibition stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: the Volkswagen Group is with Audi, Porsche and other subsidiaries, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are present and have among other things their first pure electric models: the e-tron of the Ingolstadter is due to launch at the end of the year, the EQC of Stuttgart 2019.
Both have already been officially presented.
BMW’s iNext is expected to start in 2021.
At the heart of Paris is the new 3rd.
In total, more than 250 exhibitors are represented from 4 to 14 October this year.
In addition to automotive companies, motorcycle builders as well as numerous mobility services and software providers are present in their own halls.
The fair, which this year celebrates its 120th birthday, is held every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, there were a million visitors.
At least 380 people were killed in the severe earthquake and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
There are also more than 500 injured.
The island was devastated by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first earthquake had a magnitude of 5.9, the second a magnitude 7.4.
Communication and transport connections are damaged, there has been enormous damage.
After the earthquake, the tsunami broke into the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds had gathered at the beach for a party.
It is feared that the number of casualties will still go up significantly.
So far, the numbers are only from Palu.
However, many other municipalities are also affected - along Sulawesi's West Coast.
Approximately 150 Bikers Celebrate Worship in Werdohl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne on Sunday celebrated the final service for motorcyclists at the Peace Church in Eveking with a team of helpers.
Werdohl - The place in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and therefore responsible for the spiritual concerns of PS-strong bicyclists.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) is always held on the last Sunday of the month at Haus Nordhelle.
Bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season in the Peace Church in Eveking.
Around 150 bikers had gathered there on Sunday to do anything other than ordinary worship.
As early as 10 a.m., the Boliden had been raised in front of the church’s entrance portal.
Initially, the Biker breakfast cups were on the program and it was allowed to be reinforced with coffee and cake or even with a delicate curry wurst.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, also participated.
During the Biker Divine Service, the sermon was held by the priest Dirk Grzegorek.
The musical underpinning was provided by singer-songwriter Valerie Lill.
"Although the bikers prefer blues rock, Valerie Lill suggests poetic-quiet tones," said pastor Frank Schröder.
Yesterday, too, was certainly a novum in the history of motorcycle service.
Fichttorfer Home Association celebrates big party: After the apple comes the milk
And even on the actual day of action, Borisch was active.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg was also of great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated his stunning viewers step by step the process from ripe apple to apple juice.
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the children the field and let them fill the apples in the big pots.
With a little muscle strength, the apples became a finely crushed mass.
I don’t think many of the children could have imagined how to make a tasty drink.
But they could also look at this important step of work on this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in shapes and wrapped in nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the apple pieces that looked a bit like hedgehog layer for layer over layer.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step of work was no longer so difficult.
The freshly pressed juice gradually flowed into a large vessel.
However, the Fichttorfer farmer also had already filled out specialties.
Thus he opened his "treasure box" and presented to the elderly visitors the latest spring whites.
The demand for the good droplet "Made in Füchttorf" was correspondingly high.
In a cozy atmosphere, the parents came to the conversation, while the children could not only follow the process of apple pressing, but also discover the built-up hippburg for themselves.
Also active of the Füchttorf camaraderie of former soldiers participated in the festivities and invited some stations to play briefly.
Also next year, the home association will offer an action day.
Then, however, Gregor Krützkamp stressed, will not be the home in the heart of the Spargeldorf the place of the event.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also due to the topic: After all, it will be around the milk.
1:4 vs Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth season plethora: "Beschissene situation"
After the fourth consecutive Bundesliga defeat, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professionals from Hannover 96 around and spoke to them with courage.
Many positives were not seen in the previous 1:4 (0:2) of the last table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shitty situation, but you have to get out there as a team," 96-football professional Pirmin Schwegler said, "It's obviously disappointing, because you always take a lot of action."
The still unsuccessful Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86th) joined, stands down with two counters and is a candidate of descent in their current constitution.
Led by the superb Ante Rebic, Frankfurt celebrated its first season home victory.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.<0x2B>1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.) scored 46,300 goals for the DFB Cup winner, who scored against Lazio Rom in seven goals in the round.
Croatia’s vice world champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive of Hessen at his start-up and never got into the hands of Hannover’s defense.
The storm hit long after the World Cup showed with his pace and enforceability why he is so valuable to the record.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan from FC Liverpool stood for the first time in the initial formation of the Frankfurters, who began swinging.
Lucas Torró (17th)’s headball for the first time brought danger.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was halted in a promising position at the last moment by the 96-defense against Brazilian Felipe, who replaced short-term retired Kevin Wimmer.
The guidance for the housekeepers was almost mandatory and fully deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball after a defensive corner into the prison room, Haller extended by head in front of the goal, where Ndicka only needed to hold her foot.
It was the first Bundesliga match for the defending player, AJ Auxerre, who came in the summer.
And Frankfurt did just before the break.
This time Haller matched his storm partner Rebic, who skillfully refueled himself and left no chance for 96-torr Michael Esser.
In the middle of the season, Hannover-Coach Breitenriter reacted to the weak idea of his elf and brought in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt two new offensive forces.
The Lower Saxons played a bit braver forward, but inspiring ideas remained until shortly before the end, when the match hits still.
The Hessen were much more efficient.
After about an hour, Rebic started a solo and then crossed over to De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was just a run for the Frankfurters against the overcrowded guests, Jovic also met a minute before the end.
The Morlaix Square becomes a party
Würselen Despite cool temperatures, good mood prevailed at the Oktoberfest in downtown.
Munich Mayor Dieter Reiter made it in front of millions of people at the opening of the 185.
Munich's Wies'n last week with two shots.
Songs: Spiritual Christians Celebrate Holy Cross Feast
The Spiritual Catholics celebrate the Feast of the Holy Cross on September 14th or on the following Sunday.
The festive service takes place in the city church, then there is a procession to the Church of the Holy Cross with the final vow.
The Church of the Holy Cross is home to the shot Christ, who is from the Thirty Years' War and on which the legend is said to have shot a Swedish soldier.
Then blood flowed out of the gunshot wound.
From there developed a great wall trip to the shot Christ, which then also led to the construction of the Church of the Holy Cross.
It has not been completed until today, only the altar room stands, the missing long house is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, Pastor Adolf Buhl reminds us that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
Religious service was poorly attended despite the importance of the Spiritual parish.
After the service, the procession to the Church of the Holy Cross took place and with the final blessing the church part of the crucifixion ended.
For many years, the Catholic Church Choir has been inviting the Catholic parish to the secular part of the feast.
The choir members provided the visitors with delicious meals as well as a wide selection of cakes and adapted to the weather, farmhouse.
In the afternoon, the parish community also offered guided tours around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed visitors on behalf of the parish about the damage to the façade, roof, sandstone and windows, as well as the upcoming construction measures, which will continue until next year.
After the structure has been standing for some time, the damages could be identified more accurately and the individual tenders could be prepared more concretely.
It is certain that the renovation will come more expensive than planned, as the damage already existing a few years ago has become greater, but it has also been more detected, which was only possible by the apparition by means of the skeleton.
The socket plaster works have been completed, the natural stone works are expected to be started before winter and we hope to be able to complete half of these works this year.
Inauguration: New residence in the Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The Donau-Iller Life Aid opens a new home for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße.
The fact that Münsterblickstrasse will now be handed over "a very special house" of his destiny - that was where all the attendees agreed on the inauguration date.
Finally, the twelve wheelchair drivers who have lived in the residence of the Danube-Iller for some time already rely on the special architecture of the new building.
Wide corridors, corridors and doors, larger spaces and barrier-free access for all areas has taken into account architect Rudolf Bader in his concept.
The first plans began about eight years ago, when the former U.S. Army officer building was put on the test bench for residents with mobile phone caps: "The house had come into the years and no longer modern in the equipment," Bader explained looking back.
In 2016, the miners arrived to tear down the house.
The new building should be designed as friendly and bright as possible so that residents can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
Life Aid Donau-Iller opens new home
Approximately 4.6 million euros have been invested in new construction.
The Free State contributed <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.4 million to the district of Schwaben <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>450,000.
According to architect Bader, the construction work has remained in the planned framework - both timely and financially.
He was also thanked by the Managing Director of Life Aid, Jürgen Heinz.
The spagat between a barrier-free and at the same time fire-proof structure has not always been easy.
Yet the planners and craftsmen, with the many requirements, had built a home that allowed the inhabitants to experience the freedom to move even without the help of strangers.
Gertrud Kreutmayer, the head of the social administration of the district of Schwaben, said: “The house is oriented to the special needs of its residents who need help to be mobile.”
In doing so, the residentiality and functionality were well combined, said Kreutmayer.
“The property in this situation is a real chance, because it is no longer to be acquired in today’s situation.”
In total, the new residence in Münsterblickstraße offers nearly 1500 square meters of space for 30 people with disabilities, divided into three residential groups.
Heinz is proud of the 11 full-time employees, all of whom are employed according to tariffs.
Germany: Silently Lamented Differences Between East and West
Berlin - Before the day of unity, SPD Vice-President Manuela Schwesig has appealed to all the people of the country not to disagree with the dismissal of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years of unity.
We must not be satisfied with these differences," the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern told the "Day Mirror on Sunday".
The goal must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans, on average, worked longer than the people in West Germany, but received 15% less wages.
"I can't explain this to anyone for almost 30 years after the German Unity," Schweig said.
North Korea: Does This Dirty Dog End the Korean Conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan hunting dog is supposed to smooth the wolves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has made a gift to South Korean President Moon Jae In to two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs.
According to Moon’s office on Sunday, the two about a year old dogs reached their receivers on Thursday.
They thus passed the border resort of Panmunjom along with three kilograms of dog food to facilitate the "entrainment" of the animals.
Dogs with thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The agreement was announced by the North at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in mid-September.
The two countries also agreed to join international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympics and to apply together for the 2032 Olympic Games.
In the course of the mutual approximation, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for rocket propulsions.
Austria's moving history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
To mark the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been commemorating this year for almost ten months now, numerous new books have been published, which mostly answer this question in the backdrop of the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director-general of the Austrian State Archives, puts it quite differently in the magnificent "Bilderbuch" Austria, which will be published on October 1.
New Week, New Opportunity for the Government
Back to the subject matter - this is the unofficial motto for the working week of the Great Coalition that begins today.
There was hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the Chancellor and her ministers from the CDU, the SPD and also the CSU lastly made a mantra of the “return to work”.
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other workers in this country to the rightful question, which is actually the difference between work and labour, but let it be true.
If the federal government is now to the point of re-dedicating itself to its task - to governance - it should not now be deterred by a terminology debate.
Whether the Union and the SPD can actually do something together after the provocations and blamings of the past weeks will probably be shown on Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the government parties come together to the Coalition Committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round regularly to defuse conflicts early; a lesson from the whole dispute.
First of all, however, conflicting issues are on the agenda again with the diesel re-equipment and the Professional Immigration Act.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to get the car companies out of the way with exchange premiums, SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in the obligation to technically reequip older diesel.
While there was an approximation over the weekend in the diesel crisis, Union and SPD are still far apart from the planned professional immigration law.
The SPD calls for a stay perspective for rejected asylum seekers who are working or undergoing training.
The Union is strictly against the "track shift" from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will be another dispute among the coalition partners – and how should it be different?
It is not the same as GroKo, but three partners with very different social profiles and priorities.
Controversy is good.
Without a dispute, a society marked by such diverse, sometimes conflicting interests, cannot advance.
To be constructive, however, disputes must not be re-established for partisan reasons on the question of being or not being.
It’s still about politics, not theater.
The Union and the SPD are supposed to fight - but always keep people’s realities in mind.
What is feasible and useful for many?
With this guide question, both the diesel and the track change questions can be clarified pragmatically - and thus regain confidence.
First and foremost, the People’s Party must fight.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister of Foreign Affairs
Does the Minister of Labour violate the applicable employment law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
"Real day and night" her lawmakers had been working on the social security reform, reported an overwhelming social minister at the presentation herself two weeks ago.
The statement of Beate Hartinger-Klein (FP<0xC3><0x96>) comes as a surprise to Liste-Pilz-Mandatarin Daniela Holzinger - she is now bringing the matter to Parliament via request.
She assumes that "the minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm for the deployment of her team and not to declare any violations of applicable service law in front of current cameras."
Still, she now has questions to be able to "liberate Har Tinger from any suspicion".
Police search for women's body on a street
Marxgrün – For a long time, the police did not want to comment.
Now there's a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, the state road between Naila and Bad Steben has been excavated.
The route is still closed in the Marxgrün area until Monday.
It was assumed that the investigators had previously used an archaeological dog.
The dog specially trained for the smell of old human bones, along with its guide, in multiple use, was able to narrow the relevant spot to a few meters.
In addition, a soil anomaly was discovered in the area of the said street piece in collaboration with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the highest Bavarian monumental protection authority.
For more than a year, the prosecutor’s office and the Criminal Police Court have been working on the disappearance case.
Again and again, a bike path was blocked at Marxgrün and examined with sonar devices, because the investigators suspected that Heike’s body could have been blocked here 30 years ago during the construction of the state road.
Colour powder and eggs: cravate in Barcelona before Catalonia Anniversary
On Monday, the controversial independence referendum will be held in Catalonia for the first time.
But before that, there are claws.
The separatists did not forget the police service in the autumn of 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum on October 1, 2017, there have been clashes between separatists and police in the center of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by independence advocates, among other things, with paint powder, when they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Around 3,000 officers from the police units, Police Nacional and Guardia Civil, wanted to honor their colleagues, who were employed in the polls last year during the referendum that was considered illegal.
In an attempt to prevent citizens from voting, there was also violence at the time.
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of the separatists and the central state security forces separate, Spanish media reported.
Some of the 6,000 separatists, however, had attempted to break the police label by force, and the officials, among other things, fired with colored bags and eggs.
Six people have been arrested, 24 others have been slightly injured, it said, calling on the authorities.
This is the first time that the independence referendum is held on Monday.
After the vote and a subsequent decision to split the prosperous region of Spain, the central government in Madrid had placed Catalonia under compulsory administration in the autumn of 2017.
The then regional president Carles Puigdemont fled to exile to Belgium.
Other politicians have also moved abroad.
However, several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement are still in U-prison.
In December, new elections were held in the region.
After the new Catalan government took office in May, the mandatory administration was terminated.
But the new regional president Quim Torra also insists on the "right to self-determination" of the Catalans.
Soccer: Oberliga Westphalia: Collected Disadvantage: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen break up
Red-white algae continues to grow on the spot.
Also at FC Gütersloh, it was only a 0-0 draw.
The final light and the third one unveiled them in front of 438 spectators at Heidewald Stadium as accumulated recklessness.
The first half was overlooked by the entertainment factor.
Therefore, those who prefer to get a beer or a bratwurst could do this without worry.
There was no risk of missing a torch, as there was virtually none.
First shot after half an hour
Nick Flock was responsible for the first (innocent) shot of the whole game in the 28th minute.
The best – and in principle the only real – option was possible when Cihan Yilmaz FCG guard Frederic Westergerling forced a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the penalty area.
The hosts were even more harmless.
Their most effective action was an early shift.
Storm Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, for him came Sinan Aygün.
After the change, both teams decided to do something against the growing boredom.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian Mützel scored just above the housing from 18 meters and after an hour, the merchants also appeared offensively for the first time.
After a ballerina by Matthäus Wieckowicz, it was fixed.
Nick Flock (62) "kroned" the fast-moving counter over Sinan Aygün with a butt shot in the arms of RWA guard Bernd Schipmann.
They also scored with a headball from Wieckowicz (66th) after a corner ball from ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut reacted, first brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60th) and later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70th).
It worked - nothing.
More than optical superiority, thanks to their own initiative, the Aliens did not succeed.
It was only in the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but it also brought nothing.
Angelo Daut then tried to outline the positive: "I like that we played to zero", but unfortunately the zero also stood ahead.
"We were not as dangerous this time as against wooden backs and that even though our opponent didn't want to play here," said RW Ahlens Interim Coach.
Offensively, "shocked everything a little bit" against a team that just wanted to defend.
At any rate, I didn’t have the feeling that we could have an opposite door,” Daut said.
As a spectator, however, he did not feel as if his team could shoot a goal.
The idea was too strong for that.
Rake Fields Harvest Thanksgiving Market: Fortunately, there are enough Kreimers
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder table publishing house for which these donations are intended.
Volunteers assure: "These donations will also remain in Reckenfeld".
To be opened, the sky turned bright blue, the place was still somewhat empty, but that should still change over the course of the day.
Because: "Here it's so nicely social, that's why we're here today," said one visitor.
The organizer of the Fest Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit, as always, with a decent amount of humor.
For the Brockmann couple, who should actually be weighed against food, short-term Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in.
Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) is sick.
But there are enough creams.
And the "replacement" was not allowed to entertain the more and more visitors through music.
This was so good that a few folk songs were added later on.
"Simply great," said Marcel Kreimer.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to set the opening date on his schedule this time.
He is pleased with the many assets with their stands, including mostly associations.
"Actually, there should be no such thing as a board," he nevertheless thanked for the action of the men's choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the commitment of all those who were on the stands and included the other parties held in September and the "clean up" action.
Our garden town has a colorful outline - here's what's going on.
Then the Maikranz of Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück was taken down with the help of the fire brigade and taken to the Winter Quarter.
Many stands have been worked for the physical well-being.
From sweet to sweet was everything to have.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who only lived in Reckenfeld for a year, became creative in his decoupage saw.
Furniture works, beer blanket with rack fields motifs and a few more he had on offer.
A specialty was offered by three rack fields: "Reckfelder Honey", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The latter has a specialty in it.
Honey cake in the glass, of course with honey from my own production.
The little Elsa had to approach again and again, the cake tasted so good.
It is the sociability that allowed visitors to stay there for a long time until evening, even without a stage program that does not exist during the autumn festival.
Lubricants with local political message: No successful ad for skateboarding
In Lengerich, unknowns have hardly promoted the construction of a skating plant in a favourable way.
In several places there are corresponding lubricants, says Jürgen Kohne from the municipality at the request of the WN.
At least one case has been filed with the police for damages.
In large letters, the three words "Skatepark für Lengerich!" are on signs, among others, at the Gempt Hall and at the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, Hall Manager, reports that a corresponding inscription on the advertising sign on the staircase to the Gempt bistro was discovered after the trade fair on September 19.
Since the brief message of his time was apparently left "only" with an edding, they could be removed without any problems.
"A few days later, it was there again, this time sprayed up," said Rottmann.
It is assumed that the corresponding advertising badge must be replaced.
A special note is given precisely in this case by the fact that several large companies from Langerich are also named on the board.
If the skating facility is built, its realization should also be made possible by sponsors.
There are already promises, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the urban department School, Sport and Culture, without name.
However, it is possible that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the lubricated board.
For years, local politics and administration have been dealing with the topic of skateboarding.
After the old LWL clinic was demolished, after some time, the search for an alternative location began.
Finally, the Council spoke by majority in favour of the firefighter parking lot.
However, this view was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against a construction at this point.
At the end of June a turnaround followed.
The members of the Main Committee on Finance now voted unanimously for the area of the Gutenberg School.
Jürgen Kohne says the state of things that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The last word is from the city council.
He is assuming a decision this year so that it could be built with a positive vote in 2019.
Engpass in flight security is getting worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer, German airline companies see no signs of improvement in the coming year.
"This year we had wind, in 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm comes," said Matthias Maas, head of the Aviation Safety Syndicate, the German news agency before the aviation summit in Hamburg on October 5.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight failures is the long-standing lack of European air security personnel, for which there is no quick solution.
“Airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but training for new lotteries takes four to five years,” the union said.
Europe-wide, the market for ready-to-train lots is empty.
Alone in the centre of Karlsruhe for the monitoring of the upper German airspace, about a hundred people were missing.
Maas again criticized the fact that various aviation trade unions were not invited to the summit.
In the Hanseatic city on Friday, representatives of the federal, countries, airline, airline and airports meet to address the causes of the delays.
“If you want to talk about additional work density and overtime, it won’t work without us,” said the head of the GdF, which has many members at the German air security division.
Maas once again made the EU Commission’s specifications responsible for the Lotsen Missiles.
Traffic forecasts for the regulatory period up to 2019 have been far too low.
The resulting cost requirements and staff savings in national airline security are now fully in line with the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to endeavour in Brussels for regulations that "do not squeeze the air further".
Currently, EU targets would be coordinated by 2024 and further tightening should be feared.
The EU is subjected to constant lobbying pressure from airlines.
“Ryanair chief Michael O’Leary and his colleagues are now harvesting exactly what they have sown themselves in recent years,” Maas said.
He hopes that the high delay costs in the airline will start to change.
The GdF will only contribute to the improvement of the situation if the German Air Safety Authority (DFS) offers a "harmonious training and future pact", Maas said.
The so far announced annual admission of 120 pupils over the next five years is just enough to compensate for the age-related dropouts.
The necessary staff building is not yet connected with it.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board Votes for Group Building
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously on the plans to rebuild the group.
According to the will of Thyssenkrupp Interim Manager Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed Chairman of the Board at the meeting on Sunday, the crisis group is to be divided into two independent companies.
Both companies are expected to have their seat in food and to be listed on the stock exchange.
There should not be an additional staff cut beyond the already known cuts in administration.
After two resignations, the control body has only eight heads on the capital side.
Ten representatives of the employees are in front of it.
However, the final decision is expected to be taken by a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG is expected to include, among other things, the 50 percent share of the merged steel deal with the Indian partner Tata.
The second company, Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, aims to bundle the business of lifts and supplies.
Barcelona: Violence at demonstrations by police and Catalan independence advocates.
At two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish policemen and Catalan independence advocates in Barcelona, there have been violent clashes with numerous injured.
According to the municipality, about 3,000 policemen from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as some 6,000 pro-independence protesters.
The Catalan police have tried to keep the two protest trains away from each other with a big bid.
However, according to the enforcers, supporters of independence repeatedly tried to break the security barrier.
They had attacked the officers with paint and shotguns.
According to the information, there were also camps between the participants of the various protest movements.
Rescue officials said 24 people were injured.
Police said that there were six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
With their demonstration, the police wanted to applaud the colleagues who held almost exactly a year ago against the Spanish central government’s banned independence referendum in Catalonia.
At the same time, they demanded better wages.
Spanish police and Guardia Civil feel it is unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn significantly more than they do.
The protesters felt it was a provocation that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona.
“Why did they come here to protest?” 55-year-old Catalan protester Manel Perez asked AFP.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they poisoned us a year ago.
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearic Islands, who only wanted to give his name to Daniel, denied the charge.
“Of course, we want to support our comrades who have only done their duty last year: to defend the law,” he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona because it is a big European city and there is more echo here.
But he and his colleagues “didn’t come to provoke,” the policeman said.
Panne allowed access to UK minister's personal data
A security gap in a mobile app has led to the fact that the personal data of ministers and MPs of the Conservative British Tory Party were temporarily accessible to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknowns after the pandemic became known a day before the Tory party in Birmingham.
Two people trapped on B217
The police in Hannover reported on Sunday morning a serious traffic accident on Bundesstraße 217, Hamelner Chaussee, at the local exit of Wettbergen in the direction of Ronnenberg.
Two people were killed when they drove their car against a tree.
The car is currently in flames.
The deployment forces are on site.

Football: Juve-Trainer praises for top game: Ronaldo's best game
The Portuguese star-turner "played the best game together with the half-hour of Valencia this evening," Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri praised after the record champion's 3:1 (1:1) victory against SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensive purchased star was the decisive man in the important game against the pursuer, even without his own door.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and does it well," Allegri said.
Although we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal – and from the moment we grew up.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three goal scoring, Juve turned the game after the early draw by hitting Dries Mertens (10th minute) and hanged the most angry pursuer first.
The goalkeeper from Real Madrid first set up former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who took the lead with a double pack (26/49).
And after a corner per headball, Ronaldo also made the preliminary effort to hit Defence Chief Leonardo Bonucci (76th), who had only to move just before the goal line.
"There are a lot of templates," the coach praised.
But of course Allegri also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is both in the Champions League and in the Portuguese national team of the record goalkeepers.
"We have to be even better at serving him," the coach demanded.
Best Juve goalkeeper is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three in his account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million, Juventus’ overpower seems to be becoming even more overwhelming.
Seven wins in seven games is the perfect series in the Serie A. With 21 points, the champion of the remaining seven years already has six counts ahead of Naples.
The table side coached by former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti was not without chance against Turin.
But at the latest after the placement of Mario Rui (58th), the top party was decided.
The Portuguese had to get out of the square against Paulo Dybala with yellow-red after too hard.
"We played well against a good Naples," Turin coach commented.
Emre can feel the same way.
The German national player has made his debut at Juve.
The professional from FC Liverpool was on all seven league matches.
The midfielder also played in the Champions League match against Valencia, which Allegri said with the "half hour": Ronaldo had flew away from Turin in a 2-0 win and is blocked for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West has changed his name.
With a particularly clumsy appearance, rapper Kanye West paid attention to the US television show "Saturday Night Live" over the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume ensured headaches and question marks among spectators.
The 41-year-old also announced a change of name in time for the release of his new album.
You can call him “Ye,” the musician said.
"The creature that was formerly known as Kanye West," he tweeted in reference to the late singer Prince when he dropped his artist name.
However, the pseudonym is not new.
The tenth album was released under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist had explained that "Ye" has a religious significance for him.
"I believe "Ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means "you," says the rapper.
Football: Circular A1 Münster: Finally!
Created!
Hoetmar's coach Averhage did not make his disappointment a heel.
It was a weak game of us today.
The opponent was just more handy, we put him in trouble almost all the time." The list of Hoetmar's shots is, accordingly, thin.
Grade two chances in 90 minutes, so only rare games can be positively shaped.
Football League A1: SC Hoetmar submits SG Sendenhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two options at the first pass, but the first used Maik Krause from a point of view for early leadership (7th).
In the 43rd minute, Steffen could have raised Uphus, but after great work from Krause, he broke free.
The hosts had only a double option as Moritz Höne first failed to Torsteher Jos Schuhmacher and in the aftermath Jan Blome also found his master in the Sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49.), Julian Turl (61.) and Heinz Linnemann (69.) all conceded.
A trade meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved on the torline with his hand and saw red for it - was also unable to use Niklas Eilmann for the guests (75.).
Only when Nils Berheide hit the ball over the line was the game decided (81.).
“We had been harshly criticized before, that was different today than in the last weeks,” Florian Kraus said.
Sending horse: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77th Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90th Leibig), Turl.
Tore: 0:1 Krause (7.), 0:2 Berheide (81.).
Red Card: Kortenjann (75./Hoetmar).
Football: Circular League A2 Münster: Spectacular football in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3:4
“I don’t know what to think about it,” he said.
"We don't have access to them at all," he allegedly meant the wing songs with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but probably also all the other green-white guys who came up with a collective offensive.
Laughing, he could still say, "A dirty victory," he said, drowning uglyly and pulling out of it His players, on the other hand, was the relief to note that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
Well noted, after a duel of two teams, one of which, namely Albachten, plays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, fights for class retention.
With comprehensibly mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 minutes behind him.
"It was our best season performance from a distance," he says.
"How we come back after the 0-2, how we hold against one of the top teams in the league all the time, that was really phenomenal."
It seems even more bitter that you have to go home with empty hands.
Top-Torjäger Lars Zymner led the hosts with his 12th season hit (24th).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
He scored 2-0 for Fabian Fröhning (39.).
We knew that, but a player like that can’t be completely eliminated.
“It was crazy what he did,” Lewandowski recognised the quality of the opponent.
Shortly before the change of sides, his own elf managed to compensate: McGill's free kick from left sail between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe through the long gateway (45.).
After the page change, it was again McGill who achieved the compensation (59.).
Then it went back and forth.
It was a fun, action-laden game.
Nübel again shocked Albachten (64th), just five minutes later equals Patrick Horstmann (69th).
Despite the overnumber, Albersloh was no longer able to counter the last Concordia match (80th).
We must now focus our full focus on Wednesday.
"The game against the sheep, that's what we need to win now," Lewandowski said.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87th Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87th Bareksai).
Tore: 1:0 Zymner (24.), 2:0 Morgen (39.), 2:1 McGill (45.), 2:2 McGill (59.), 3:2 Nübel (64.), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80.).
Yellow-Red: Atalan (74./Albachten).
Football: TSV Strassberg fights point against Primus
There was no winner in the national league duel between TSV Strassberg and FV Biberach.
The leader of the table had actually scored three points, but the team of coach Oliver Pfaff stood very well and ended the game 0:0.
Media: The entire Bureau of Dynamo Dresden resigned
The entire presidency of soccer goalkeeper Dynamo Dresden has resigned, according to media reports.
Several media outlets in the evening referred to a joint letter of the Saxon Parliament.
At first, there was no confirmation of the association.
The reason for the withdrawal should be internal power struggles with the former Bundesliga.
Erdogan in Germany: politics instead of pump
I'm glad he's gone again.
There are few national guests whose departure in Germany provides as much relief as those of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
For three days, the Turkish president was a guest in Berlin and Cologne, and many had meant that he should not have been invited at all.
Evangelische Akademie Tutzing: Prominent guests and new offers
The Evangelische Akademie Tutzing offers about 80 meetings by mid-Next year.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has signaled that he wants to collect the Tolerance Prize in Tutzing in person.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: as a federal president, he was not at Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after Wulff was a guest there.
Udo Hahn, the director of the academy, proudly said: "All the federal presidents and federal chancellors were already with us." The re-emergence of celebrities at the academy at the Tutzing Castle was a subject of the presentation of the annual programme.
At the end of October, songwriter Konstantin Waker takes part in a meeting on spiritual experience from a philosophical perspective, on September 29th, the writer Frido Mann is at a meeting about his grandfather Thomas Mann.
In the meantime, French President Emmanuel Macron has also promised that he will personally receive the "Tolerance Prize" awarded to him by the Academy in Tutzing, which is also received in another category by television presenter Dunja Hayali (we reported).
The approximately 80 meetings by mid-2019 have it in themselves.
"The pension is not safe!" says a headline.
"SOS at Europe's borders" - this is how the academy describes the "risk and deadly route across the Mediterranean".
"And to a meeting on Syria: "Barbari without borders".
Weapons deals, destruction, torture, death – war exalts every human idea".
From structural racism in society to the shears between the poor and the rich to the radical change of work through digitalization, the spectrum reaches.
Academy Director Hahn was convinced: “A free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to look for solutions or at least partial solutions.”
At a meeting of 200.
Karl Marx’s birthday soon expects one more visitor to the direction of capitalism criticism, the others rather a tendency “from left to center”.
What does it look like with neutrality?
"We are 100% a daughter of the Evangelical National Church," said study leader Dr. Ulrike Haarendel, "so we are not 100% neutral."
Musical cabaret: Gender understanding with heart - Wolbeck - Westfälische Nachrichten
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday night in the hall of Christ Church in Wolbeck.
As a Kabarettestin, Teubner imagined gender understanding, not only with humor and warmth for the (feeling) woman and for the (feeling) man and whatever else it may be, but also with music.
The mini-guitar put her in and also mastered her violin.
Ben Sükerkrup was sitting on the wing.
On the one hand, he is a real pianist of the male Sparring partner, who sometimes even comes to the end of the sentence, and on the other hand, he is a pianist: So congenially harmoniously accompanied by Sükrüp Teubner, that some may have wanted a solo.
There was also, with Beethoven and Chopin, but differently, namely as it fits the red thread of the evening.
There, Teubner had brought a paradox into play: The man’s satisfaction comes when he has a partner, but he doesn’t open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, is of no use.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same thing: What would have emerged from Mozart’s composition if “the Nannerl” had opened the door unexpectedly?
Thus, Süverkrüp glides through improvisations, from Bach's "O Head Full of Blood and Wounds" into the "Song of Death", and from Mozart's g-moll symphony into a playful dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full room.
Flowers were handed over to Karlheinz Kleinje, treasurer of the association, the canonette.
However, President Heidemarie Markenbeck was not allowed to take an additional thank you.
She had the idea to give the duo, in addition to performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt, one in Wolbeck.

The controversial tech billionaire Elon Musk may remain CEO of electric car manufacturer Tesla, but must step down as chairman of the board of directors.
Musk also agreed to pay a two-digit million fine with the U.S. stock exchange supervisory SEC, the SEC said.
Background is Musk’s surprise announcement of August to want to take Tesla from the stock exchange.
The SEC accused Musk of making false and misleading statements in her complaint.
Bruchsal.
After a bus accident on the A5 in Baden-Württemberg, the police easily corrected the casualties.
10 passengers were injured rather than 15 passengers.
Everyone has now been discharged from the hospital.
The French bus driver had stayed in the hospital for one night to be observed.
He will be fired during the day, a police spokesman said.
The cause of the bus accident at Bruchsal is still unclear.
On Saturday morning, the bus was braced frontally against a steering wheel.
Handball: Women's National League: Ahlener SG keeps the white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The Aliens had problems especially with third-league player Carolin Stallmann, who only scored ten goals.
"Actually, I was very happy with the defense, only one player has made too many goals.
We didn’t get them,” said ASG coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more concerned about the many missed opportunities.
The concentration in the final left his team missing this time.
The ASG therefore ran almost to the end of a rebound, was behind by 11:12 and later by 15:18 (45.).
It was not until the end that the wider bank of hostesses became decisively noticeable.
In addition, Aydogdu put Merle Klement backroom on the left, who then made "extremely clever the decisive gates" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pump, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3rd League Women: Top performance of the BSV East Defender in the top game at VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyball players of the BSV Ostbevern have re-established themselves in the top group of the 3rd League West.
VC Allbau Essen defeated the Blue-White by 3:1.
“It was a big step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz to play in the top third of the league.
This is what we have now prepared," said coach Dominik Münch after his team's almost perfect performance at the crashed table leader.
On the first pass, the guests dominated almost as desired.
Over 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 he went to the vice-champion of the previous year with 25:15.
Food has been accepted in the second line, but has not come into play.
We did a good job with them.
Our opponent has smashed at high risk, but also produced several tickets.
In the second sentence, the BSV already led by 12:8. "Eating has changed the assumption to three-row.
We couldn't keep up the pressure.
The food has been soaring, and we've had a little bit of sleep," Münch continued.
At 18:17, for the first time, the volleyball players from the Ruhr area had their nose in front.
At 19:24, East Beveren scored four more set balls, but the fifth attempt found his goal.
"The game was a better class now," said the exercise manager to the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge contributed significantly to the BSV turning the sheet in the third section from 14:16 to 25:21.
Münch: "We played there consistently and quietly."
Over 7:3 and 15:13 the blue-white crossing four with 25:22 on their side.
Vera Horstmann was chosen as the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier had also captured an excellent day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish municipality: mosque opening as missed opportunity
The Turkish municipality in Germany (TGD) has criticized the way the great Ditib mosque was inaugurated in Cologne by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
“The opening of the mosque in Cologne has left in the German-Turkish relationship a sheriff’s heap that can only be tediously reversed,” said the chairman of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, to the German editorial network Germany.
Both the Turkish and the German sides would have missed the chance to have a common, conciliatory appearance.
"Instead of side by side with German top politicians to underscore the Muslims' affiliation to Germany, Erdogan has used the term for his purposes," Sofuoglu complained.
The widespread exclusion of the German public has "strengthened many reservations".
Home association Nottuln: Offer has already established
After the long summer break, it’s finally time for folks to meet again.
On the 18th of October (Thursday) at 19.30 the Home Association Nottuln already hosts its fifth emergency folk meeting in the chimney room of the Old Officers.
Almost exactly on the day it was a year ago that we had a folk meeting for the first time.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln," said Hanns Moormann, chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
I wouldn't have thought that our folk meeting was happening so quickly in Nottuln eta.
Whether storm deep Friederike in January or heatwave in July, the chimney room of the official was always full.
"The program at the next folk meeting is, as always, a colourful mix of German folk, hiker and seamen songs, folk songs, evergreens and old batsmen," says Karl-Heinz Stevermuer, who invites friends to Nottuln.
On the first "birthday" folk meeting, Klaus Spellmeyer agreed with his accordion.
For many years he was a member of "Gaitling", a group from the neighbouring district of Steinfurt that played music with German lyrics.
Now he's on the road with an Irish folk band.
The organizers of the popular meeting will remember the last event in the summer, when Christoph Schulz of the popular meeting Emsdetten with his international version of the song "Frösche in der Nacht" enthralled the audience and sent them home with an earworm.
“We expect many happy guests to spend a sociable and humorous evening once again,” the home association’s invitation said.
Anyone who plays an instrument and has a desire to participate actively is invited to join.
Since the desired seats are always occupied quickly, it is advisable to be there long enough.
The popular meeting starts at 7:30 p.m., but admission is already at 7:00 p.m.
China approves planned merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all open questions must be clarified by 24 October.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are taking a step further on the path to the world’s largest industrial gas company.
The Chinese Competition Authority approved the planned merger, Linde said on Sunday.
Thus, the billion-dollar merger still stands for approvals in South Korea and - as the biggest hurdle - in the United States.
Recently, the chances of an insider’s approval had improved there, because Linde agreed to the sale of additional firms.
For legal reasons, all open questions must be clarified by 24 October in order for the merger to succeed.
From pure fruit production to ecology
With a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger Hall, the 125th anniversary of the Circular Association for Gardening and Land Care was celebrated.
On September 29, 1893, with a fruit show at the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus, the last founding moments were set for the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landpflege Kulmbach, and exactly 125 years later, on Saturday night, he celebrated a great anniversary in the Kulmbach City Hall.
In 1893, the mayor of Kulmbach, Wilhelm Flessa, raised him from his baptism as the district obbstbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land.
Even the purpose of the fruit-growing association differed from today’s work – it was actually about fruit-growing, flowers and gardening, no one thought about it at the time.
"At that time, in the era of enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," said district caregiver Günter Dippold in his festive speech.
Fruit trees should be planted on long-distance roads, so-called industrial gardens were built in schools.
Obstanbau is still the task of the 55 gardening associations in the district of Kulmbach, which comprise nearly 7000 members.
However, the spectrum is far from exhausted.
Close to nature gardening, organic plant protection, village decoration and nutrition play an equally important role as the transmission of knowledge, healthy nutrition and youth work.
How versatile the tasks of a gardening association are, the members of the Hutschdorfer youth group "Maulwürfe" entertained on stage.
“Youth work is urgently needed especially in the digital age,” said Günter Reif, chairman of the district, and OB Henry Schramm, stressing how important experiences in nature are for life.
Collecting chestnuts was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that you can collect a similar amount of joy with Smartphone & Co..
Schramm promised to plant two trees for the anniversary together with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner.
"Where they are supposed to stand, the Kreisverband decides," added Landrat Söllner and highlighted the special importance of garden associations for the villages.
The circular association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many gardening associations in the county also left no doubt about it, district manager and expert advisor Friedhelm Haun.
He guided the many visitors with an image lecture through the long history of the Circular Society and reported, among other things, the need for post-war self-sufficiency.
Earlier everything came from the garden, for the winter it was inserted.
In the late 1950s, however, the utility garden turned into a decorative and residential garden.
"Nature has survived, it was already there before us and we have to focus on it," the expert for fruit and nut trees said.
That’s why the gardening associations are encouraged not to give up, so that our home stays beautiful and worth living.
This also includes welcoming the new citizens in our associations, added the president of the Bavarian Landsverband, Wolfram Vaitl.
"We have to stop the eccentric decline of insects, we owe it to our children and grandchildren," Günter Reif concluded the successful festakt, which was solemnly framed by the turret blowers of the music association Thurnau.

Priority on Nafta talks: Canada’s foreign minister postpones UN talk
Mexico’s government wants clarity on Nafta: they offer an ultimatum to both trading partners for an agreement.
Canada's foreign minister now gives the trade agreement an absolute priority - and postpones her speech before the United Nations.
Due to the time pressure to reissue the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the United States and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of this Saturday, the minister will not speak until Monday before the UN plenary meeting, her spokesman Adam Austen said.
In the meantime, they focused on the renegotiation of Nafta.
Mexico’s economic minister Ildefonso Guajardo said on Friday that the negotiating leaders of Canada and the United States would have 48 hours to agree if Canada actually wanted to join the trade agreement already reached between its country and the United States.
The U.S. and Mexico agreed in August on a recast of the Nafta regional free trade agreement.
U.S. President Donald Trump indicated that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
The talks about a new edition have been going on for over a year.
By Sunday evening (local time) they are to be finalized, the Trump administration wants to present the agreement to the US Senate before October 1.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico’s designated President Andrés Manuel López Obrador announced on Friday that he would endeavour to reach a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against Presidential candidates Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who was injured in a knife attack, has left the hospital.
The right-wing ex-military wanted to fly to Rio de Janeiro, where he lives, according to a report from the newspaper "O Globo".
After his resignation, it remains unclear whether the 63-year-old will make public appearances last week before the presidential election in the South American country.
The politician was attacked on an open road during an election campaign in southern Brazil in early September.
Meanwhile, thousands of people took to the streets in several Brazilian cities to protest against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele non" (in German: "Der nicht"), women's associations had called for protests against the former military.
Also on social networks, the associations mobilized racist and women-oriented statements against Bolsonaro.
Thousands of protesters were expected in the economic metropolis of São Paulo.
In the capital, Brasilia, the protests mixed with a statement by the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers’ Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He succeeded former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and was therefore not allowed to run for office.
The presidential election in Brazil will take place on October 7.
As the former mayor of the millionaire city of São Paulo, Haddad was far behind the far-right candidate Bolsonaro in polls.
Although the “Trump of Brazil” has long been involved in politics, it has recently presented itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates reach the absolute majority in the first round, there will be a ballot on October 28.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will emerge from this unsuccessful – no matter who he is against.
Bolsonaro is known for fighting against homosexuals and blacks and glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
He is shocked over and over again with verbal deflections.
Another time, he said the supporters of Lula’s leftist working party should be shot.

After a long illness: Danish rock legend died
Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen said on Larsen’s website.
On the deathbed, Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children.
The musician has been in treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen became known for the band Gasolin', which was a huge success in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Their songs were influenced by international music sizes such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the dissolution of the band in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold around three million records in Denmark.
His 1983 album "Midt om natten" is the best-selling album in Denmark to date.
Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen praised Larsen in a statement on Sunday as "street arrests" that were "against everything but in all hearts".
The head of government also recalled that the opponent of the monarchy Larsen appeared in 2010 on the 70th birthday of the Danish queen Margrethe II.
Rocknight in the shoe factory: volume at the pressure air hammer level
"Here we stand, take the bone saws and ignite a concert evening with the power of a tiger". Only the band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" put such a rewriting of the rocky live music experience on Saturday night in the hall of the Bürgerdroin Band with three-pieces of the city center:
After the sound check and just before the start of the concert, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There is no trace of lamp fever.
After that, the rock protagonists from Aalen and the surrounding area - all in conjunction with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - with their bands loudly enthused the around 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night.
Already the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows how to convince the start of the concert evening even with the latest, unknown pieces from its own spring and the soon to be released CD.
In front of the stage, the band dances for the harmonious and pressing interaction.
Although "Zugabe" calls cannot be heard, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leaves the stage to the trio "Here We Stand".
The fact that hardrock is not the same as hardrock is demonstrated by guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich at the bass and drummer Kai Hölscher with their alternatives, sometimes reminiscent of classic rock of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers", in addition to the guitar rock, a synthesizer is also used at "Here We Stand".
Not only does "Take Me Home" sparkle by changing melodic passages to the guitar-charged rockriffs of the multi-layered songs.
However, since its founding in 2005, the quartet "The Ignition" from Tonnishäuschen has gained a special degree of fame.
With full agility, the band will present their hardrock on Saturday.
The fact that "The Ignition" with its appearances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the 2017 China Tour - has a special stage experience is obvious and unheard of.
In collaboration with the band, singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann also puts their own accents on Cameo's only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" from the 1980s.
For the sound that feels even higher than before, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a delightful solo, running through the audience.
Of course, a certain volume is part of the genre at such a hardrock concert: at the "Mint Mosquito" rock night, according to information from the mix-up team at the three-star concerts of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Iwazion" et.
This is, for example, at the pressure hammer level, but it is still clearly under the controls of the "Wacken-Festival", pointing to "The Ignition" on their website.
Attractive 120 decibels in nozzle engine volume, as is common with the annual metal-steldichein in the north of the Republic, however, the general public does not need this rock night.
After just four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocky Gangart have long been convincing with their sovereign, virtuous play and their own compositions.
“Here we stand, we took the bone saws and set a concert evening on fire with the power of a tiger,” the three groups can say at the end.
And above all, enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

One dead in sailing plane crash at Essen/Mülheim airport
There was a fatal accident at Mülheim/Essen Airport.
On Sunday, a sailplane crashed at a parking lot at Mülheim/Essen Airport.
The pilot died in the accident.
A fatal accident occurred near Mülheim/Essen Airport on Sunday.
According to the Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung, a sailplane crashed at the exhibition park at the airport.
The pilot was killed in it.
As the "WAZ" further reports, the student was on board alone - the pilot is said to be a single-owner.
The plane was already on landing at the time of the accident.
The crash site is just a short distance away from a tent on the airport grounds.
There has been an Oktoberfest since this weekend.
Mülheim/Essen Airport is located on the city border of the two Ruhr district cities and directly on the access to Highway 52.
From the parking lot there is a Park&Ride offer at major events in the Messe Essen or the Gruga Hall in Essen.
Trump to Kim: "And then we fell in love"
The fact that the US president of North Korea, the powerful Kim, is quite well-suited despite the nuclear crisis, is no secret.
But now Trump has made a real statement of love to his colleague.
It also has to do with Kim's "beautiful letters."
At the tender age of 72, the married U.S. president met a new flame.
The tragic: It's a long distance relationship.
In public, Donald Trump made an unusual statement of love to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Saturday.
In front of supporters in the U.S. state of West Virginia, Trump found almost gentle words for the half-old Pyongyang dynasty’s ruling dynasty, though the nuclear disarmament ring around North Korea proved to be quite cracked.
“I was hard-hearted, he was too, and between us it went back and forth,” Trump said.
And then we fell in love.
- Okay?
No, really.
And not only the conversations with Kim would have melted his heart.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection has also been politically fruitful: Trump has referred to the halt of all atomic and missile tests announced by Kim, even though critics have seen little more than lip recognition behind it so far.
That the affection for the famous “Rocket Man” — Trump’s nickname for Kim — would not be more cherished by everyone, the U.S. president seemed quite conscious.
In any case, he took the criticism to be expected at his appearance in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling just in advance: “Donald Trump says they have fallen in love.”
How awful, how awful is that?
That's so unprecedented.
But he didn’t care very much, Trump said, pointing his finger at the crowd: “I’ve always told you it’s so simple to be presidential.”
But then there wouldn’t be 10,000 people pushing into this crowded arena out there, but we would only have 200 people out there.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler Bestens visited, atmospheric and also spoiled by the sun: very varied and with a good shot Oktoberfestflair has exhausted Baesweiler’s downtown on Sunday.
For the first time, the Oktoberfest not only took place in a tent at the fire tower, but was extended to the city by the trade union on Sunday.
Refugees Rescued from Libyan Prison
Nigerian refugees have pointed to their disastrous detention conditions in Libya through a mobile video, enabling their rescue.
The group had shot the recording in their cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July, at risk of death, and distributed it online.
“They refuse to send us back,” a man said in the video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The recording was sent to the website "France 24 Observers", whose editors alarmed the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally flown to Nigeria at the end of August.
“Without the video, we probably wouldn’t have been able to return to Nigeria,” Efe Onyeka, who recorded the video, told AFP.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya while trying to cross the Mediterranean to Europe.
With the video, he put himself at risk of his own death.
One of his competitors was nearly killed by the guards, Onyeka said.
In general, the conditions of detention had been disastrous: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organizes the voluntary return of refugees who are stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria have been sent back home this year through the program, said IOM spokesman in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the now rescued Nigerians is not exceptional given the poor conditions of detention in Libya.
He hasn’t heard of a phone call yet.
International organizations have long criticized the situation in Libya’s refugee camps as inhumane.
The North African state, which is largely dominated by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on their way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the public school on Sunday afternoon to prepare her lessons for Monday, she surprised a burglar.
At 4:50 a.m., the teacher entered the building over the main entrance.
In the hallway of the first floor, she saw a man fleeing immediately.
First through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there a climb to the ground floor or the front square.
The teacher understood the police who took up the investigations.
Whether things or money have been stolen is yet to be said.
Description: Approximately 16 years old, black, very short hair, slightly darker appearance, dark pants, dark t-shirt.

German was trapped in his own car for days.
A 75-year-old man has had to endure in his car in a forest area in central Franken for several days and nights after he stopped the car off all forest paths and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescuers accidentally discovered the car on Saturday afternoon near a grassland and released the missing since Tuesday night, police said on Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld, according to the data, was in good health despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He said he was now looking forward to his home.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family after he had not returned from a ride with his field car across the local meadows and fields on Tuesday.
Despite intensive search efforts, the man’s stay had been unclear for days.
Laschet calls for rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) in a conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has warned of the rule of law in Turkey.
Relations between the two countries are currently "overshadowed", Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne Airport.
This concerns in particular the arrests, the press and the freedom of religion.
He therefore made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to normalize in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this.
Laschet also reported cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey, according to his own statements.
He has formulated the expectation that freedom of expression will be respected.
Erdogan once again stressed the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The talks between Laschet and Erdogan had been briefly moved to a building of the Federal Ministry of Defence’s flight readiness at Cologne Airport.
Originally, it was supposed to take place on the castle madness – but the castle owners had refused it out of political conviction against Erdogan.
After the talk, Erdogan went on to open the Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had canceled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said, “Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country.”
And we are also their contact partner - and not the Turkish President.
Missing trust in the U.S.: North Korea demands disarmament
While U.S. President Trump will not get tired of emphasizing the successes in North Korea’s denuclearization negotiations, the East Asian regime represents the conditions of the rest of the world.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for Washington’s reception.
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, has accused the U.S. government of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula with its ongoing sanctions.
“The recent stagnation is due to the fact that the United States is building on coercive measures that are deadly for trust formation,” Ri said in New York.
A disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea in these circumstances.
“Without any trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances, there is no way that we will be the first to disarm ourselves,” the North Korean chief said.
The fact that North Korea’s sanctions could “force on its knees” is “a dream of people who don’t know us.”
In order to build trust, however, his country has stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed an atomic test facility, Ri said.
However, there have been no "appropriate reactions" from the U.S. side, the minister criticized.
Due to North Korea’s nuclear and missile program, the UN Security Council alone had three sanctions against the internationally isolated country last year.
U.S. President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have pushed the United Nations for strict compliance with the sanctions in recent days.
At the same time, the U.S. government is working on a rapprochement.
In June, Trump first met North Korea’s powerful Kim Jong Un.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US president is looking for a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is scheduled to return to Pyongyang to talks about the end of North Korea’s nuclear weapons program.
The Hot serves: New kitchen with donations from the municipality
That they were actually in a youth meeting, the many visitors to the house of the open door Hot got nothing: white blankets and flower jewelry on the tables and a large buffet awaited the guests after the harvest service.
Enchanted, the youth of the Hot had the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The facility was funded by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank themselves with the food.
Starting with the new facility was not easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, recalls.
We had our fridges filled with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then on the first day after the summer break came the bad surprise: a power outage had put the huge, two-piece refrigerator out of operation, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
“Now we had to start over again: we have got a lot of support from friends and neighbors, but the children and young people wanted to do it alone,” Westbuer said.
And so they all packed up.
The result could be seen, the guests were thrilled.
"Better cooks can't do it either," a visitor praised, while Hokkaido turkey soup was served or guests were allowed to serve quiche, liver cheese or cake.
"It's really great what the children and young people have put on their feet," Frank Beckmann said, while the wizard Stephan Lammen was surprised by card tricks and other art pieces.
Jürgen Sator leaves the Board of Directors NRW
Frustrated with criticism from his own ranks, the head of the Essen board, Jörg Sartor, has given his position in the National Association.
Sartor had become known throughout the country because the Essen board had introduced a stopover for foreigners.
He had already resigned in July as vice-chairman of the NRW boards, Sartor told the World on Sunday.
I liked too many in my back.
Wolfgang Weilerswist, head of the NRW Tafeln Landsverband, expressed his understanding of the decision of his long-time deputy.
Serious criticism has taken Sartor along with him.
"I can understand his step - there have been people who didn't know exactly why the Essen board is doing that."
Sartor is still active for the Essen board – “six days a week, nothing changes,” says Weilerswist.
Sartor again criticized colleagues from other boards in the "World on Sunday".
One should not follow the approach, "without us, the people in the city are starving".
It is the responsibility of the state to ensure that people do not starve.
The Essener did not attend a conference of the panels on Friday in Berlin.
“I’ll be told too much sweet shit,” he said.
There are all these social fusions that criticized me that way at the time.

The VfB Stuttgart also won the first round.
Due to a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic decimated by Werder Bremen before the break, the Stuttgarters had to be frightened in the meantime.
Borna Sosa and the unaware Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler manufactured a curious insert-owner’s gate, which gave the guests the 68th minute to compensate.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to the first win.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience a fully successful but also failed debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbachers who joined the Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang gave a lead twice, eventually playing 2:2 and are still awaiting a win over the VW City since 2003.
Renato Steffen was in charge of Wolfsburg's 1-1 match with his second Bundesligator.

Although Stuttgart defender Borna Sosa and Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought the Bremers back to the game through a curious pitcher-owner (68th), Gonzalo Castro shot the overnumbering Stuttgarters back on the road to victory a quarter of an hour before the end.
Nuremberg decided the duel against Düsseldorf 3:0 sovereign for themselves.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens already took the home team on course by means of Foulpenalty.
Macedonians vote on new state names
In Macedonia, around 1.8 million citizens today vote on whether to change the name of their country in North Macedonia.
With a yes, the nearly three decades-long conflict with neighbouring Greece could be resolved.
Athens had insisted on a change of name due to its same-named northern province and blocked any approximation of Macedonia to the west.
Voters also decide on the future of Western integration.
The U.S. had announced that the country could quickly become a member of NATO in a positive outcome of the referendum.
Syrians in U-Haft.
Refugees attacked three women.
A Syrian raped three pensioners brutally, injuring them in part.
The 41-year-old asylum seeker had ransacked in the escape street in Alsergrund on Friday at about 10 p.m.
When the police arrived, they spoke to the accused, who fired ballooned paws on passengers and tried to attack them, on his behavior.
The Syrians then tried to beat the officials and toss them in.
Shortly thereafter, it turned out that the suspect had beaten three older ladies (65, 67, 75) with his feet to the ground at a tram stop on Währinger Straße.
He also walked the trio with his feet.
The pensioners were partly seriously injured.
They suffered hematomas, prednisone and concussion.
The asylum seeker was also seriously injured "for an unknown cause", as the police called it.
He was taken to the hospital and monitored throughout the treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs is marrying his friend
Almost exactly one year after the entry into force of the marriage for all, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.
On Saturday, the two of them took their word in Hamburg.
A registered life partnership had not been questioned for her, Kahrs had previously said in the "Picture" newspaper.
"If we get married, that's right." He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a budgetary spokesman for the SPD Bundestag faction and one of the spokesmen for the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage for homosexuals, on June 30, 2017, Kahrs had aroused anger.
He had accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of "stupidizing" the issue.
"This was your Shabowski moment," he said in reference to the accidental announcement of the DDR border opening by Günter Shabowski.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example with the right of adoption.
Garden day: 400 meters hedge cut
There was a lot of work in front of the members of the association Kinderhaus and the Society for Leprakunde.
For about 400 meters of hedge around the gardens of the inhabitants of the friend house should be cut.
Supported by the residents, it went to work for about twelve supporters.
"We are doing this to reduce costs," said the president of the civil association, Walter Schröer.
And so much has accumulated.
Due to the hot summer, we are late this time, but fortunately it is now just a cut of shape.
In the spring, the hedge had already been cut.
The breakfast that always comes to work has a long tradition as well.
“Everyone should stay with the force,” said Walter Schröer.
World Cup in Rio: Hannes Aigner wins gold at the World Canyon Championships
Augsburger Hannes Aigner has won the gold medal at the end of the World Canoeing Championship in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old made a perfect run on the Olympic track on Sunday.
Two years ago, he had missed the Olympic bronze by three hundred seconds.
I was well-prepared, I had enough rides on the site already and it fits everything today,” said the London Olympic third.
At the end, he threw his paddle away from joy and pointed both arms victoriously to the height - knowing that it would be enough for at least one medal.
After all, he had the starting number four.
However, the remaining six starters were unable to peak their fabulous time of 89.69 seconds.
Second, the Czech Jiri Prskavec before the Russian Pawel Eigel.
The Gauting Police Inspectorate lists the first attempted burglary this autumn in a single-family house.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days will be shorter - this is what hackers want to use again.
This is how the Gauting Police Inspectorate reported yesterday the first attempted burglary this autumn.
The fact that it has remained at the single-family house on Kingsweiser Straße is due to the alarm system.
It started when the perpetrators laid hands on Friday just before 8:00 p.m.
The intruders knew the residents weren’t home.
The alarm system, however, apparently surprised her to the point that they managed to escape without a prey.

Hertha: Retrieved from reality: Bayern against Ajax demanded
The predicate is insurmountable: the defeat in Berlin does not want FC Bayern to "love".
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim phase for the term of Niko Kovac.
The first small performance part under the new coach Niko Kovac is not meant to rise to the greater depth of autumn for the Munichers.
"A week ago we had the impression that we were invincible.
Now we’ve got a bit of reality,” Thomas Müller said after the deserved 0:2 defeat at Hertha BSC and demanded a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us knows that this is annoying to us, and that is why we are giving gas in the direction of Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year, no own goal shot outside, as at the same time of the pre-season two mandatory games in a series without victory, the table lead in the Bundesliga first lost to Borussia Dortmund.
While the overall situation has not been as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record champion has yet to be warned.
FC Augsburg delivered two blue pauses in the 1:1 run with its men-to-men intensive tactics and the Berliners through their playful needle stitches over the outside within three days, just as the last overpowering Bayern are to crack.
"Those who know FC Bayern know that we don't like it and we will do everything we can to be successful again," Kovac said.
Otherwise, however, he was surprisingly gentle with his losers in his hometown and shifted his first defeat as a Munich coach only to the again deficient handling of chances.
A victory against Amsterdam and Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would still make the first interim phase of his term of office positive before the national game break - otherwise the tone would probably intensify.
Kovac did not take any extraordinary action before the second king-class appearance of this season after the 2-0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the free day on Sunday, as planned, the brief preparations for the second round against Ajax, which also had a 3-0 victory over AEK Athens.
"Now we've been caught in two games, but we're going to make our goals again," national team captain Manuel Neuer said in a statement.
As was the case after the losing Pokalfinal against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place, especially Joshua Kimmich Klartext spoke.
The defendant appeared in the role of a magistrate.
“I don’t think it’s all bad, we have to rework it because we don’t make the many opportunities and make the mistakes behind it,” the 23-year-old said just before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, the Bayern already had five counts behind Dortmund, which has now taken the lead again with one point of lead.
And so Kimmich, with a blind eye, at least positively said that now the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bayern has come to an end.
“Yes, that’s good,” the national player said.
It’s good for the league.
DFB boss in shooting line: <0xC3><0x96>zil-Causa: sharp attack by Erdogan on Grindel
With serious accusations, Turkish President Erdogan calls for the exclusion of Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the association line.
Now a new post should be created.
Berlin - On different stages, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the interpretation of the continuous dispute theme Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil.
After the Turkish President harshly criticized the handling of the former World Champion in Germany for the opening of the Grand Ditib Mosque in Cologne, the DFB chief defended the association line.
Early Sunday morning, the Grindel, personally attacked by <0xC3><0x96>zil, announced the consequences of the incident at the ZDF-"Sportstudio" in Mainz.
“In the future, because we also have many players with migration backgrounds in the U teams, we have to draw very precise conclusions that something like this does not happen again,” said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without migration background as a further integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel once again stated that Erdogan does not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
In sharp words, he accused <0xC3><0x96>zil and Ilkay Gündogan of racism.
Our German-born and raised Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil and our Ilkay.
They have excluded them from this society because they took pictures with me in England,” Erdogan said in the city of Dom on Saturday.
Honestly, as their president, I couldn’t digest the fact that our two young men, who had climbed up to the German national team, were excluded.
Grindel referred to Gündogan’s statement that, unlike <0xC3><0x96>zil after the World Cup affair, which had taken photos of the two with Erdogan, he felt “reasonably treated by the DFB.”
At the same time, he announced that he would like to present himself to players in the future.
That someone says, "If I win, I'm German, if I lose, I'm a migrant - that's not possible."
"I'm very sorry that he has such an impression," Grindel said.
We should have defended Mesut more, I’ve always said.
But he doesn’t see a basis for <0xC3><0x96>zil’s return to the national team either.
As a result, an additional integration commissioner will now be appointed in addition to the Brazilian-born Cacau and Celia Sasic, who have family roots in Cameroon.
“If a person without a background in migration clearly affects society and football and says, ‘The issue is important, we have to take care of it,’ that would also be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our local associations where integration needs to work,” Grindel said.
Despite the criticism of his post after the World Cup and the <0xC3><0x96>zil affair, he wants to run for DFB president again next year.
“I’m doing my job and I’m trying to make it as good as possible,” Grindel said.
Year-old builds three accidents within three hours
Coburg/Rödental - According to police, the 75-year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10am and 13pm.
Initially, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady on the red light in the area of Lauterer Höhe.
She told the retiree that she was driving against her car.
However, there was no exchange of personnel, as the 75-year-old could no longer find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later, a phone message was received from the police about a driver who had left the road and drove against a driver’s seat.
When asked about it, the man did not want the local police and then drove away.
After that, the Redskins went home.
However, the pensioner has been working in his residence for decades, and when he turns, a construction vehicle has crashed.
Finally, the police were able to find him and stop him.
His car suffered significant damage from accidents.
The 75-year-old made an impression and couldn’t remember much anymore.
The damage is about 1300 euros.

About four weeks after the outbreak of the Moorbrand on a Federal Army site in Emsland, 980 more personnel are employed in the erasure work.
This was reported by the Bundeswehr on Sunday.
As the situation continues to evolve according to a spokesman, the last 70 volunteers were withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of personnel is planned, it says.
On the night of Sunday, an upper-world fire was discovered and erased.
Last week, the disaster was cancelled, which was well proclaimed a week earlier on September 21, because fears were feared that the flames would endanger adjacent forests and settlements due to wind and spark flight.
On Thursday, it was said that the fire would no longer threaten neighboring communities.
At the time, more than 1,500 personnel on site tried to get the big fire under control.
The Air Force will continue to support the work on the Bundeswehr test site near Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with the Federal Army's drones.
For the 2nd and 5th of October, according to the Bundeswehr, further exploration flights with "Tornados" are planned.
The fire was triggered by test rockets fired by Airbus technicians.
The smoke flag of the Moorbrand was temporarily drawn up to a hundred kilometres across northwest Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr wants to set up a contact point that receives damages.
First claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday home owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs is marrying his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Katharinen in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost exactly one year after the entry into force of marriage for all, the politician married his longtime friend in Hamburg.
They have been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost exactly one year after the entry into force of the marriage for all, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.
On Saturday, the two of them took their word in Hamburg.
A registered life partnership had not been questioned for her, Kahrs had previously said in the "Picture" newspaper.
When we get married, that's right.
He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a budgetary spokesman for the SPD Bundestag faction and one of the spokesmen for the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage for homosexuals, on June 30, 2017, Kahrs had aroused anger.
He had accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of "stupidizing" the issue.
"This was your Shabowski moment," he said in reference to the accidental announcement of the DDR border opening by Günter Shabowski.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example with the right of adoption.
Referendum in Macedonia on new state names started
In Macedonia, the eagerly awaited referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Approximately 1.8 million voters are expected to decide whether their state will be North Macedonia in the future.
This is because of its same-named northern province of neighbouring Greece.
As a means of pressure, for almost three decades, Athens had blocked every approach from Skopje to the EU and NATO.
If the citizens voted yes, they will also give the starting point for the western integration of their country.
Elie Wiesel - The Author Who Saved the Shoah from Forgetting
The Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel would have turned 90 on September 30.
The 1986 Nobel Peace Prize winner dies in the United States in 2016 and leaves behind a work that preserves the horrors of the Shoah for the afterlife.
Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donor
The register is intended to facilitate organ donations and relieve family members in stressful situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can continue to be removed only with explicit consent, Swisstransplant stresses.
(dpa) Switzerland will launch an electronic register for organ donors on Monday.
This is intended to facilitate organ donations and relieve family members in stressful situations.
People who want to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your requests can then be obtained from Swiss transplant if necessary.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs - as in Germany - are allowed to continue to be taken only with explicit consent, Swisstransplant stresses.
It is assumed that 15 percent of Swiss people have a donor card, says Franz Immer, director of the Swiss Transplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of cases, a card will be found at the decisive moment with potential donors.
In more than 60 percent of interviews, family members do not know the desire of the deceased.
"You then have to make deputy decisions in the sense of the deceased, which is often very burdensome," he said.
A similar registration system already exists in the UK.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information on possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as says the spokeswoman for the Federal Center for Health Education, Marita Völker-Albert.
"There is no register where people can register their wishes - for or against organ donation," she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has called for a new arrangement of organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would initially be considered an organ donor unless he or his family members object.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student is world champion in head counting
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is world champion in head counting.
He spent the weekend in Wolfsburg against 39 competitors.
Martina Flamme-Jasper from the Science Museum Phaeno, the venue of the competition, shared it on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Salut from Germany took third place.
The youngest World Cup participant was a twelve-year-old Japanese student, the oldest a 74-year-old retired from France, as Chief Arbitrator Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Sachsen) organizes the competition every two years.
Previous tasks were, for example, 14,130 214 x 17,981,822 or 57,809,355 <0x2B> 28 x 16,448,333.
Since spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon in which participants entered against guests from the audience with pocket computers.
Wenzel’s greeting from Lastrup demonstrated how he kept a ball with his head in the air while computing.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Salute was already two years ago when a 14-year-old was present in Bielefeld.
With terms such as super brain, genius, or wonder child, organisers can start little.
"Head counts can be practiced," he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore there are even stage-oriented computing competitions.
The disciplines include, for example, drawing square roots from six-digit numbers.
When calculating versatility, candidates are given surprise tasks for which they need to quickly find a solution strategy.
Here, too, the Germans would have good chances, the chief arbitrator said.
Otherwise, Asians are often in favor because it is more intensively learned in early childhood and with other effective methods.
Invasive Appeal: Video with Naked Serena Williams: Breast Cancer Early Detection
Tennis-ass Serena Williams is shown by her sensitive and sensitive side.
With this video, the 37-year-old wants to point to breast cancer and work hard for early detection.
It is about life and death, but also about courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings at the top without the song "I Touch Myself" from the group "The Divinyls" - only her hands cover her most intimate positions.
Singer Chrissy Amphlett has died.
The emotional video is part of the "I Touch Myself" project, which focuses on early detection of breast cancer that can save lives.
Serena Williams died almost a year ago.
At the birth of her daughter Alexis Olympia, there were complications.
An emergency OP was launched to save the baby’s life.
In a subsequent CT, blood clumps were discovered in Serena’s lung.
Just in time...
The government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The federal government plans a clear extension of the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the Turkish-Blue Coalition will send a corresponding bill on the so-called "Symbol Act" under consideration.
In this way, the number of terrorist or similar groups that are covered by the prohibition should be significantly expanded.
Polar Cold Air Brings New Snow to the Mountains in the West
Mrs. Holle will shake her beds in the West for the first time next week: Polare cold air will reach Vorarlberg, Nordtirol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to meteorologists from the Central Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit will drop to 1,500 to 1,200 meters at the beginning of the week - in narrow valleys, it could snow down to about 1,000 meters at a strong intensity, it said.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohen Tauern, snow can be expected above 2,000 meters with 20 to 40 centimeters of snow.
On higher passways (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions are therefore winter.
Farmers are allowed to start the annual Knick Care on Monday
Farmers of Schleswig-Holstein are allowed to start the annual Knick Care on Monday.
The unique "green walls" in Germany have shaped the landscape of the forest-poor Bundesland for some 200 years.
The up to five-meter-wide tree and grapevine ponds are "forest substitutes" and for many animals and plants the last retreat spaces.
Knicks connect living spaces scattered as corridors, through which the exchange of organisms can still work, said Ingo Ludwichowski, Managing Director of the Naturschutzbund Germany (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were captured by order of the Danish king Christian VI in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field boundary and cattle fence, they also supplied the farmers with firewood and beams for their specialty houses.
From that time, his name also comes from "Knick": by "Changing" the branches were able to develop the dense, interwoven demarcations.
Today, between the North and Baltic Seas, the hamlets stretch about 45,000 kilometres and give the image of a wooden, diversely structured landscape.
According to NABU, they are now used as a substitute habitat by around 7,000 animal species.
In a kilometre Knick could live up to 1,800 different species and breed up to 30 pairs of birds.
However, its ecologically important function can only fulfill the knick if it is properly maintained in winter.
Otherwise, he cares for a light tree series that, in addition to species diversity, also reduces the wind protection effect, said Ludwichowski.
Knick care may only be operated outside the breeding season from October to March, according to the Ministry of Agriculture.
After the tsunami in Sulawesi Indonesian talks about the situation on the spot
In an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND) the local situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquake and tsunami is described:
Were you there during the tsunami?
No, I was in Jakarta on the island of Java at the time.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned of the tsunami, I immediately set out on my way back to Sulawesi.
I arrived there on Sunday morning because I had to drive for more than 20 hours after a flight, as the airport on Palu was closed at the time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that auxiliary goods can also be flown.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all completely destroyed.
Our World Vision office has also been destroyed, but we have temporarily set up something where we have also housed other people.
Where are the people living in Sulawesi now?
Many are stranded on surrounding hills, where they still endure fear of another tsunami and earthquake and where they have no access to water and food.
Some stop in front of their houses, there are still post-mortems.
Because many grocery stores and also the gas stations are completely closed, people partially steal food and gasoline.
The public service is completely down, the national government is helping out.
A prison was also destroyed, the prisoners were partly free running around, and finding them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How is communication and information provision on the island?
At the moment we have a handy reception, but this has not worked before and we have only received information via radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors, and other people they don’t know if they live or where they’re staying because people weren’t at home during the earthquakes, but on the road, for example.
The tsunami warning system has not worked properly.
Do you have any information about this?
We don't know why, but when the warning came, many thought, "Okay, no tsunami," and then he came.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was misinformation that a tsunami was hitting the region and they were stranded on the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi on the Pacific Fire Ring not prepared for earthquakes?
There are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how we react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.
Muscle injuries to Werder: VfB has to give up Aogo and Donis for a long time
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will be missing at VfB Stuttgart with severe muscle injuries for a long time.
Aogo scored a muscle fiber riss in the rear left upper thigh at 2-1 against Werder Bremen on Saturday, the football Bundesligist announced on Sunday.
In Donis, the doctors diagnosed a muscle fracture in the upper thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably still miss games even after the next country break.
The VfB Stuttgart did not give a forecast for the time of failure.
A muscle fracture usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle fiber fracture usually heals slightly faster.
Triumph of Hyperrealism at the San Sebastian Film Festival
San Sebastián - The San Sebastián Film Festival closes annually among the most prestigious European festivals.
All the shows in the cinema can be summarized: 2018 was a remarkable year for the film.
After a convincing competition in Cannes, especially with strong contributions from Europe and Asia, and a Venice that was able to attract a lot of attention with Oscar candidates from Hollywood, San Sebastian also delivered one of his best competitions of recent years.
On Sunday morning, the Olching firefighter tried to capture an injured duck.
However, the action went on for some time.
Even a boat was used.
Olching - Walkers at Lake Olchinger spotted a white, injured duck on Sunday morning.
She stayed in the area of the water watch station.
To help the animal, the passengers called the police and the fire department.
However, the first attempts to catch the rabbit went wrong.
In spite of the injury, she was able to evade the deployed forces repeatedly.
At the end, she ran to the lake.
With a rescue boat, the firefighter was able to circle the animal and push it back to land, where it was then inserted into a transport box by a firefighter with a hearted handle after almost an hour.
The rabbit wounded at the chest was then taken to the animal clinic of the LMU to Oberschlißheim.
But according to the first estimates, their chances of survival are rather low.
Biathlete Julian Eberhard wins the World Cup
Biathlete Julian Eberhard was in fourth place at Olympia for a long time.
Next winter, the Saalfeldener wants to recover the missing precious metal at the World Cup in <0xC3><0x96>stersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old in the Pyeongchang Olympic Sprint the medal to grab near.
Seven ten seconds were missing in the end on bronze.
"I consciously took time to process this," says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym gym in his hometown of Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top form, but it just didn’t want to be.
The Pinzgauer is all the more motivated to recover the missing precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to come back to a big event with the constitution, to win something.
At some point, you have to hit.
The World Cup in <0xC3><0x96>stersund (SWE) is Eberhard: "I have already closed the track to the heart", he remembers with joy his fourth World Cup place in the individual race last year.
Immediately after Olympia, he celebrated the only single win for Austria in the last World Cup winter in the mass start competition of Kontiolahti (FIN).
With the season, he ran second in Oslo (NOR).
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation at a turbo pace
The time is extremely short and the number of interviews planned is very limited.
With an FBI probe at a turbo pace, Republicans in the U.S. Senate want to secure a highly thin majority for the disputed candidate Brett Kavanaugh on the grounds of necessity.
President Donald Trump has set a deadline for investigators by Friday to clarify the alleged incidents that are more than 30 years old.
The latest twist in the drama about Kavanaugh’s vocation accompanied by a cultural struggle was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing by Kavanaugh and first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, during which the lawyer issued angry tyranny against the opposition Democrats, the Senate’s Justice Committee should set the way for the final confirmation of the U.S. Supreme Court judge.
The majority of Republicans seemed secured when Senator Jeff Flake suddenly declared against his original announcement that he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who had described the heavy reservations as "decision" on Thursday, initially contained further attacks against women and spoke in contrast to "luck in misfortune".
In this way, last doubts could be eradicated, he said.
Trump later attacked the Democrats sharply at an election rally because they rejected Kavanaugh: “They are trying to block and destroy.”
Trump orders FBI investigation into Kavanaugh case
The White House has also severely limited the powers of the investigators.
One will be targeted to investigate the known allegations of two women, no longer, a government official told the Wall Street Journal: "They are not going on a fishing trip".
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses will be heard.
According to the municipality of Ried, the mobile radar device installed in a "civil vehicle" for monitoring the pace limit is stationed on the Gartenstraße from Monday, 1 October.
There is also the Federal School Centre.
The municipality also operates several fixed installed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: One felt the fear
Trainer Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated their first win against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first season win.
However, the time factor also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - It is now known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist in football games.
This was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
“I saw every ball in there.
And there were many corners and many balls in our prison room," said the sports board of Schalke 04 - and breathed out.
Eventually, the Royal Blues managed to bring the short 1-0 against the Rhine Hessen over time and thus the first season victory under roof and field.
In fact, it could have been different.
After the leadership by Alessandro Schöpf gave safety to the 11th team of head coach Domenico Tedesco, Tedesco said: "Together, the first half was good, both playful and pressing".
Don't actually create a headball monster
"The last ten minutes have felt like two hours for me," Heidel said, "If the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands and therefore continued to withdraw.
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three counters of the season.
"We all liked a huge stone from the heart," said Schöpf, who did not play an insignificant role in his headball hit: "I'm actually the worst headball player in the men's team."
In the end, only victory counts.
The relief was noticeable throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start in the early stages and make a fireworks out of it," Schalkes chief coach said.
Victory was important.
Finally, we can enjoy a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We played intelligently, quietly and bravely, so we have to deal with games over 90 minutes
Probably the biggest shortcoming of the afternoon: Kingsblue was missing to worry about clearer conditions.
The possibilities for this were finally there, for example, by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice hit the latte 59/72 or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have been a shy victory," Tedesco said: "You've already felt the fear a little bit."
That's why I'm glad we won.
He was not the only shalker.
Fischbachau: Smoke column in the Leitzach valley 2 km visible
The smoke was not to be overlooked.
About two kilometres away, a hiker observed a fire in the Leitzach valley on Sunday at about 13.30 a.m.
Now the police are investigating.
Fishbachau - Police and firefighters soon found out about the cause: An unknown person had lit garbage on a two-square-meter-square-square area on the Gschwendner mountain.
According to the police, it seemed like he had monitored the fire for a long time, but then left the glue unattended.
And that's near the forest.
Thirty fish bakers firefighters were busy pulling out and erasing.
The police are now investigating firefighting.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: a discussion at eye level
In front of them is the author, Professor Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has repeatedly followed the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"For many years now, I have made it my task to bring interesting people to Counten," said the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Meeting" - the association that cooperates with the "Cultural Policy" alliance in the evening.
El-Mafaalani enters the reading very loosely, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject clearly.
With a lot of gestures, solid numbers and one or the other joke, he brings the audience closer to one of the most conflicting topics: migration and integration.
Why are conflicts growing despite successful integration?
The Syrian author uses himself to answer the question of a metaphor.
At a table sits the German society, at a cat table the migrants of the first generation.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to sit at the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to participate.
This leads to conflicts.
Therefore, it is decisive not to be politically right-wing or left-wing, but rather to be in favour or against an open society.”
At first it is more likely to behave, then the discussion round is getting more and more ripe.
And there is a need for speech.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among students.
El-Mafaalani stands, not on stage, a symbol for the discussion: it is at eye level.
The sociology professor does not push his opinion, stressing that he is talking about the average, not about individual mailboxes.
He is pleased that there is interest in the topic, because “only when we understand what the problem is, we can find solutions,” says El-Mafaalani.
During the subsequent signing hour, he also continued to discuss the questions of the guests and also in the foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialties.
Basketball: Bonn and Gießen win start games
The Giessen 46ers and the Telekom Baskets Bonn have finished the first day of the Bundesliga (BBL) with a home and abroad victory.
Gießen scored 91:84 (43:46) against the central German BC in a hard-hitting match in his own hall.
The ambitious Bonners won at BG Göttingen with 86:79 (49:47).
Alba Berlin is the first leader of the season after the 112:55-Gala on Saturday against Science City Jena.
At the beginning of the new season, the German champions Bayern Munich and former series champion Brose Bamberg had more difficulty.
Munich already had a 83:77 at ratiopharm Ulm on Friday, Bamberg won the Frankenderby at s.Oliver Würzburg on Saturday with 84:80.
Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The demand is apparently huge: over 100 interested parties have applied for the purchase of one of the lands in Landsham South.
The municipality of Plening has sold the first land in the newly built Landsham-South area on the open market.
Mayor Roland Frick said.
In addition, the application phase for those 20 plots that the municipality offers at more favourable terms or prices is completed - similar to the previous local model.
Well, 100 applications have been received, so Frick.
"The documents are currently being reviewed", with regard to the application criteria, completeness and accuracy.
According to the Plieninger Bürgermeister, the goal is to have the candidate ranking for the 20 plots by the end of the year and to present them to the municipal council.
After that, the assignment can take place.
A total of 50 plots for single and double houses will be created on the area in the south of Landsham, as well as four plots for multi-family houses with an estimated eight residential units each.
The conclusion is now almost complete, and the roads and roads will soon be asphalted.
One single plot as well as two of the multi-family houses belong to a private person, the rest of the municipality of Plening.
It sells the majority on the free market, 20 plots in the socially compatible model.
According to Frick, the two multi-family houses of the municipality will be built as affordable housing.
With a total of 16 free-state-sponsored, income-oriented apartments.
Space for 200 people
It is roughly estimated that the area of the newly built Landsham-South area will create housing space for about 200 people.
Not only that: Now, in the beginning of October, according to Frick, there is the start for the new construction of a children’s playground.
It is intended to accommodate three kindergarten and three crib groups as well as a multipurpose room.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, the start of the next kindergarten year.
This is how Schalke’s Naldo succeeds in “great sport” on the bank
For the third time in a row, Naldo thanks Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues did not sit in the Startelf for the third time in a row, but on the exchange bank, the understanding would have been great for many people if the nearly two-metre Brazilian had spoken so correctly about the fruit of the soul.
But when the Schalker players, after the 1-0 victory over the FSV Mainz 05, gathered as usual in the middle circle and thanked head coach Domenico Tedesco with all his professionals, the 36-year-old, all of whom simply called Naldo, switched to one and said, "Wir;
"That was very emotional, that was great sport," Tedesco later said of the reaction of his vice-captain, who, despite his re-reservist existence, did not bother at all.
Probably Naldo, who was celebrated as the best schalker last season, knows that he did not actually get into a break with his coach - but for good reason he gets a break.
A reason called "load control".
It wasn't easy to tell him that.
"It wasn't easy to tell him that, I'm telling you quite frankly," Tedesco said from the moment he told Naldo that he wasn't in the starting elf.
He is an important player, he is an important person.
But it’s all over again, it’s all about the club,” Tedesco said.
Naldo has played against Bavaria and Porto for 90 minutes.
He's 36 years old.
It is important that at the moment everyone can browse through.
And that we all keep in the boat,” Tedesco explained the rotation, which lastly also caught Naldo.
And to which the Brazilian reacted with the wisdom of his advanced age: by also proving himself on the bank as an exemplary team player.
The mood in Austrian industry has continued to accelerate its valley journey in August compared to the eurozone.
The Shopping Manager Index (PMI) was 46.7 points on a 37-month low.
Europe-wide, Austria still holds the third-best vote behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute said on Monday for its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the PMI of the euro zone increased by 1.1 to 45.1 points, and the index is still below the mark of 50 counters for the 13th month in a row, indicating growth.
Ireland’s industry alone broke this threshold by 50.9 points in August.
The final result was the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer declined more slowly than in the previous months.
In Spain, the index reached the highest level since March with 44.0 points.
“The slightly weakened valley ride could mean that the worst has survived,” said market economist Rob Dobson.
However, the industry - in the third quarter anyway - remains the number one growth brake.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the eurozone have not fallen as strongly as since November 2011.
The companies therefore completed the seventh consecutive month.
Also in China, industrial production declined more strongly in August than initially assumed.
The mood barometer dropped from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts initially expected 47.8 points.
The Purchasing Manager Index is based on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
Developments in sales, employment, stocks and prices are raised, among other things.
Tuchel's PSG team wins in eighth league game
29 September 2018 at 19:45
Nice coach Thomas Tuchel rushes with Paris Saint-Germain in the French Football Championship from victory to victory.
At the OGC Nice, the defender won thanks to two matches from Superstar Neymar with 3:0 (1:0) and was also successful in the eighth league game.
Last year, Olympique Lyon had made such a good start in France 82 years ago.
Brazilian Neymar led PSG after 22 minutes and made the final in the aftermath.
Christopher Nkunku (46).
Paris also won the general test for the leading second Champions League group game against Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
For the start of the royal class, Tuchel’s team had to accept the only mandatory defeat so far this season at 2:3 in Liverpool.
