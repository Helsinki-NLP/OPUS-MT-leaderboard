Right-wing populists triumph in Austria: in total they have 29%
The noticeable weakening of both parties in the great coalition and this marked strengthening of the right-wing populist parties have led, according to early provisional results, to the early parliamentary elections on Sunday in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (<0xC3><0x96>VP), within which the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously vacillating, has suffered particularly strong losses.
On the contrary, the Union’s electoral leader for the future of Austria (BZ<0xC3><0x96>), Kärnten’s deputy prefect Jörg Haider, is preparing for a triumphant return to national politics.
According to the provisional results, the country’s strongest party remains the socio-democratic party (SP<0xC3><0x96>) with 29.8% of the votes, but loses 5.5% compared to the last elections in 2006.
Worse still, <0xC3><0x96>VP lost 25.6% to almost 9% of the vote.
These are the worst results of these two great parties in the Austrian post-war history and above all the literally catastrophic result of the people, which provoked early elections.
Even at the beginning of July, when the <0xC3><0x96>VP left the coalition, the people had a considerable advantage in their preferences over SP<0xC3><0x96>.
But voters have obviously punished them for submerging the government.
Already in the first reactions to the results there were speculations about the possible resignation of the party president, Vice-Chancellor Wilhelm Monterer.
Observers believe that it could already happen on Monday during the extraordinary convocation of the party’s leadership.
This development should perhaps facilitate the path to the increasingly likely way out of the election result, i.e. to the renewal of the SP<0xC3><0x96> and <0xC3><0x96>VP coalition.
With regard to the reinforcement of both right-wing populist parties (FP<0xC3><0x96>) the liberals earned 18% and the BZ<0xC3><0x96> 11% of votes in advance, but the socio-democrats revealed at the same time the concern of another Eu 1999, when the populists agreed with the Union in the same time as the Union, which was part of the unilateral government.
On this evolution obviously plays Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to collaborate with any party and assumes a return to Vienna in national politics.
The Greens also managed to enter Parliament, but it fell slightly, falling among the Austrian political parties from third to fifth.
No other party has obviously exceeded the 4% threshold and has not entered Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool
If the problem could not be resolved with Czech scientists who have been accused of illegally harvesting shrimp in India, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said, a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations would take place.
The minister mentioned this in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If it doesn't work out, then there would be some cooling," he said after the meeting that took place under the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee after the negotiations said that executive power can hardly interfere in legal matters.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>vácha, who was discharged from the charge and punished with a fine, the central government can negotiate with the local in Dardjeeling what falls under his jurisdiction.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
According to Mukherjee, it would be better, for Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era sentenced to three years in prison, to resort to a higher instance.
Then you can ask for release on bail and wait for the sentence in freedom.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed himself the same way during the negotiations.
"It recommends appealing to the Major Court then it will be possible to get the grace," the head of Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech side can enter the case is to provide the convicts with “competent legal support,” the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said that such support is already being provided by the Indian side.
“We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relationships that have been going on for many years with India.
The Indians also admit it," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told <0xC4><0x8C>TK, in front of his partner he stressed that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We truly consider it a profound mistake to detain and indict these Czech scientists," he said.
The minister has avoided answering the question of whether he has received the promise from the Indian side to take care of the matter.
“I’ve gotten relatively many promises,” he just noted.
A Czech judge in the battle for the seabed
It approaches the electronic map on the wall on which Australia and the adjacent marine zones are drawn.
But it is not interested in the continent but at a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
“The island belongs to ‘Australia and along with her the seabed adjoining.
The area is at the same time large as the continent itself, says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of a team of 33 UN Division workers on ocean and maritime rights issues.
His head, the Czech Lawyer Director of the Division, Václav Mikulka, is following his presentation and occasionally adds something.
It dominates the desire to work and enthusiasm.
The seabed still hides a little-known world rich in natural resources.
It is possible to find oil, metal minerals and other minerals, but also unknown living organisms that carry within themselves the key to the discovery of cancer medicine.
The largest ground on the mainland
The coastal states began to pay attention to the underwater territory.
According to the UN Convention, they take advantage of the laws they signed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of the so-called continental platform which often extends up to several hundred kilometers from the coast of the state in question.
According to the Convention, this has an exclusive right on all resources of the continental platform.
“In a few words, continental platform means that part of the seabed and its subsoil that is a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
The so-called exclusive economic zone extends beyond the territorial sea often over 200 nautical miles,” explains Mikulka.
The request for which the country submits to the Commission for the definition of the size of the continental platform must be accompanied by a very extensive technical and scientific documentation based on many costly investigations and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparation.
"One of our tasks is to provide the committee with legal and technical-professional assistance.
The Commission has so far dealt with five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three nominees have succeeded,” Mikulka adds.
Australia’s recent success, which has significantly expanded its maritime holdings, has recorded a global eco.
But New Zealand has also earned us - the surface of the seabed, which was assigned to it by the commission last week, about 1.6 square kilometres, so more or less six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The profit, which will benefit him in the future from the seabed, as they promise, will be invaluable.
Other states will also gradually submit their requests.
They can do this for ten years since the “Montego Bay Convention” has been ratified.
Where the continental platform ends, the area of the bottom of the ocean that the convention has declared a common heritage of humanity begins.
No one here has an exclusive position any longer.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by this international institution established by the Convention.
"But the Marine Corps is not Klondike," he says exaggerating director Mikulka, "by the fact that its individual parties are legally demarcated and their regime is contractually established."
The Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic today.
It is divided with other states of the former Soviet bloc within the framework of the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
It acquired the status of a so-called "pioneer investor" in 1991 under the convention, as well as investors from a few other states.
It has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean extending between Mexico, Hawaii Islands and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor and slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is cracked, it's almost an underwater replica of Tatry.
"It is possible to extract over a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a landfill rich in polymetallic agglomerates containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,” said another Indian lawyer, Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian division worker Rober Sandev brings with him a find to show it.
It looks like a little potato or with a little bit of fantasy, a legendary scheme, like in the Golem Awakening legend.
German special units were present at the release of the hostages.
The Egyptian government had asked Germany for help to liberate the hostages – the experts then arrived.
When the situation became critical, the special units were ready, but they did not intervene.
On the circumstances of the release of the 11 European hostages kidnapped, more and more detailed information comes to us.
On the rescue operation, as mentioned by the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, German special units participated.
In addition to military specialists, the GSG9 units, the Federal Aviary Police, the Federal Criminal Office, as well as the logistics experts of the technical institution were present on the site.
As the ministry spokesman said on Monday evening, German units did not intervene because the hijackers, given the danger of a force intervention, released the hostages on the run.
The Egyptian government has accepted the aid offered by the Germans, to join as assistance directly on the spot.
"We didn't get there by luck," said a spokesman for the interior ministry.
On September 19, a group of passengers were kidnapped in southern Egypt: 5 Germans, 5 Italians, one Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian escorts.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in southern Egypt, hostages were deported to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers until the end was kept secret as well as details of the release or possible ransom payments.
In the meantime, the liberated have arrived in good condition in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages are under the protection of the German embassy.
The details of the release have not been explained.
There was no information in Berlin about when they would return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild", the five vacationers and special units are expected to fly with an Airbus of the military aircraft and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejects the bailout.
The first chamber of Congress just failed the <0x24>700 billion bailout package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell down.
With 206 votes to 227, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s bailout package for financial markets.
Despite the appeals of U.S. President George W. Bush and leading politicians from both parties, there was no majority for the program, with which the chaos of financial markets should be settled.
In a dramatic action, supporters desperately tried to persuade critics from the <0x24>700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the leaders of the negotiations, urged MPs to agree, even though the plan was unpopular.
8. It is difficult to have gratitude to avoid something that has not yet arrived..
While the Dow Jones vote was in progress, it collapsed more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The reason for investors’ concerns was that the state bailout could have failed.
It resumes before the end of the vote and then, after the announcement of the failure, collapse again.
Experts now expect other serious turbulence in international financial markets.
To ensure that the program comes into force, it must have the well-being of both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate.
Promoters record increasing number of bookings
It looks like it will be a good winter for German tourist operators:
According to one study, the turnover on travel bookings for the next months compared to the previous year increased significantly - for the winter season even by more than 30%.
Despite weak conjunction views, the Germans' desire to travel under investigation remains strong.
On bookings for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a 31% increase in turnover over the same period of the previous year, as announced Monday in Berlin by the German Tourism Association DRV.
According to the survey by the GfK market research institute, there are increased booking quotas even for the autumn months.
So the travel agency surplus for October compared to 2007 would be about 11%, the DRV said.
Presumed for these results are the figures of the GfK, which monthly analyzes the booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and develops statistical projections for the whole market.
Also included would be travel bookings made until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar quote, travel to the United States in particular would be required, the DRV reported.
Here the increase in bookings would amount to about a third.
They would also be particularly sought after destinations for the Germans in Spain, Turkey, Greece, as well as inland locations in Germany.
Above all, all-inclusive trips have a high rating, DRV President Klaus Laepple explained.
Given the rising costs for energy and food, the costs in this case would be "better computable for customers than for an individually organized holiday."
Consumers could save money through, among other things, discounts on bookings made in advance or all-inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
Even the summer months would have recorded excellent booking figures, so much so that compared to the previous year, a surplus of turnover would have been recorded again - although according to a further study the number of Germans who made a trip, compared to the previous year, declined.
My first time at the Oktoberfest
Ballermann's hits, one-liter bottle of beer and VIP in Dirndln griffati.
A debut in Wiesn
Susanne Kronzucker and I really don’t have much in common.
She is a blonde, television moderator and wears a tailor-made Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is second hand.
But one thing we have in common: just 3 minutes at the Wiesn, the photographers are already shooting at us and taking photos until they fill the memory of the cameras – very shiny, and this on my first visit to the Wiesn.
That's how you make friends
The two-dollar Dirndl seems to reach its goal.
As a tourist of Wiesn and actually a resident north of the equator of white sausages, the sense of well-being in costume/clothing remains within its limits to this day.
And instead, once you get to Theresienwiese, it's nothing serious.
Almost everyone wears Dirndl or leather pants; nobody looks disgusted or embarrassed – everything perfectly normal.
Only my Dirndl’s cradle gathers strange glances at the banana chocolate stand.
A monk tells me that I would have wrongly tied the cradle: "To the left you are free, to the center you are virgin, to the right you are engaged, behind a widow."
Soon I set my back to the left.
“Okay,” he says and laughs.
Others make less waste of subtle flirting techniques and wear superb felt hats, on which they say "To drunk to get dressed!" and stir the naked back against an uninvited.
The boy with exhibitionist inclinations is called Bob, he comes from England and also visits the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a slash "ooooo.".
This tells me, after he got rid of his beer bubble from a liter of drunk before.
Right next to one of these hydrants, everyone thinks she's a dickhead.
In short, Bob is one of those famous "Wildbieslers".
Others have no luck getting rid of alcohol in this way.
Towards 8 p.m., the sanitary workers walk around the party square, who have to take care of the poor good people.
The nurses appear every time in the blanks – always 4 at a time dragging a barrel covered in tents.
This works as with most Wiesn visitors: you go empty, you return full.
Anyone lying under the tile in this blood-alcoholic barrel can't see.
"Des sind die, wos goarnimmer packn," cries one of the sanitaries and disappears in the baraonda.
Victim of an accident identified by the police
A 63-year-old woman who died in a hospital after being stabbed by a vehicle while walking in Essex has been identified.
Carole Paulson, of Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but she died shortly thereafter.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on inadvertent driving charges.
It was released on bail.
Turkey is expanding diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey tried to enter the European Union, the European powers were eager to penetrate deep into the Turkish hinterland.
On the eastern part of the Bosphorus, perhaps 20 steps in Asia, is one of the most beautiful relics of this failed imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neo-Renaissance style.
At least that’s what tourist guides tell you.
The building is riding between the ends of the platforms with a tower on each of its corners looking at the world like some German provincial municipalities.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is decadent.
But once inside the office ticket from the ceiling from time to time, there is no doubt about the size of the enterprise of what was the most western passage.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a retarded imperialist, wanted to realize its ambitions to dominate the Middle East through this railroad that ran in Damascus, Baghdad and beyond in what is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany’s imperial ambitions drowned during the First World War.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
The relative isolation from the surrounding region, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has passed
British and dominant forces advanced out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there was bad news for Hyderpasha station as well.
In 1917 a train of ammunition exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was a sabotage.
Since then it has slowly gone into disguise, largely outperformed by history.
But today, this railroad departure for Anatolia and all the points to the east, serve - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's growing diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party – the AKP – has created a whole new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from its surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has passed.
Now there is a new policy of commitment.
Notably, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To estimate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded the carriageway to the Turkish capital Ankara, to visit one of the AKP’s leading foreign policy experts, Turkish MEP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning – about ten and a half hours later – after a run of swamps along the tracks that produced the cadences from the ancient world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital – proposed as a new city for a secular state intended to turn its back on its Ottoman past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic roots represents an exemplary shift in Turkish consensus.
He suggested some suspicions in the West, most notably in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern stone and steel structure - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by built-medium shopping centers and power pastry, where managers in complete business - both men and women - meet up against them first.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a center-right politician from almost any other political party in Europe.
Complete, tie, I'm sure he also had a Blackberry.
“The purpose of the foreign policy party now is to reintegrate Turkey with its closest neighbors.
The Cold War was an anomaly,” he says.
Turkey has been cut off from its interior.
Today it has to look east and west at the same time.
It was not the case of one or the other.
They must be both.
"But surely at some point," I ask, "will Turkey be forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he says, "doesn't want to face that choice."
Then he points out a point that almost all of those with whom I have spoken here have spoken in memory: the ties of not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus, and all around the Black Sea, are as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are for Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, the whole of Europe can metaphorically travel those railway lines east through Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha station, after another white night, I think of those two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who had looked at this building built 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to find that Europe's Middle Eastern ambitions can now be largely in Turkey's hands.
And while I wait for the ferry terminal that takes me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe".
At the time, there seemed to be no doubt about which continent to make claims about this fascinating country.
Vite remember: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: as the musical director of Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (Necrology, September 11) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and choir.
As a member of his music scheme for the municipality, the following year he founded his wonderful youth choir, Proteus.
They were supposed to be under 21/ under 21, but by the time the Proteus sang its final in 1979, many of us were more than 20 – we simply refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being-mutable) represented the good will of the choir and the ability to deal with everything that the music presented to do, both madrigal and messiaen, without accompaniment or with the whole orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often astonishing, always exciting, and it was all because of that man’s inspiration and enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant over the years.
How often Tod told us to "let the music speak for itself."
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there, in the music.
“Sing it!”
His technique in the use of the basket was absolutely clear and precise, although never dictatorial or flourishing.
Whatever the standard of music, it made it more and more high.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If you had to appoint a knight to an orchestra director, it would have been Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades he led the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years and more, I’ve seen more than 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I’ve never disagreed with just one of them – and many times inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of personal greatness and modesty.
He hated orchestra directors who, in his words, simply “went around the world one or two well-known battle horses.”
We'll miss so many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your necrology of William Woodruff (September 25) specifies that "in 1946 he resumed studying economic history at Oxford and in 1950 he became a researcher at Houblon-Norman... studying at the same time for a degree in science, a letter and a doctorate."
This follows from Woodruff's author's note in Beyond Nab End, but it's not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, during which time he completed a PhD thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
He spent the 1950-51 years in the United States as a researcher at Houblon-Norman, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he permanently left Nottingham for Illinois.
Because Woodruff chose to cover this part of his career, we don't know.
J. Vincent Resino at the Faculty of Philology
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino "Flamenco y vida", because his photographs in black and white, in documentary style, are extraordinary.
They drew my attention to the simplicity and strength they convey, while treating the protagonists with particular respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feeling.
Resino manages to capture magical moments."
Second robbery for Honda Supersoldiers
In November, Honda will launch the second-generation Jazz model.
If the previous model was already equipped with great habitability, this new single-volume has an even wider interior space.
A refined mechanics must be added to everything, which increases the comfort of driving and allows you to save fuel.
Evolution versus revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although the new Jazz aesthetically presents a line very similar to that of the previous model, the changes in this monovolume are numerous.
Among other things, it is worth mentioning an innovative design, a new platform, larger sizes and new mechanics.
However, before we go on to analyze the new model, it is useful to note that this new Jazz arrives six years after the first-generation market entry.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than those used by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe the Jazz model is less well known than in other markets, it remains a unique phenomenon in terms of sales.
This is exactly the case in Japan, where Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002 and also in 2008.
In Japan, almost one million units of Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The second market was the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
Despite these figures, Honda believes that the new Jazz will increase sales in the segment.
Thus, if in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 units of this model, for 2009 estimates are around 100,000 cars, assuming a 17% increase in sales in the European market.
As for the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 units of Jazz since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda’s total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, the head of the Spanish subsidiary is expected to sell around 2,000 units of Jazz in a year.
The arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to reduce sales declines in Spain to a good extent.
In fact, the company’s managers expect to arrive at the end of the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, or 4,000 less than in 2007, with a 16% decline.
Despite the increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
In addition, the Japanese company is expected to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this, Honda trusts in the arrival of another new model.
This is Insight, a five-door compact hybrid – 4.37 meters long – of which the Japanese company hopes to sell around 200,000 units a year worldwide.
For markets and according to estimates by the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight’s sales will take place in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, immediately after its company presentation in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has grown in all its parts.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), its width 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and its width 2.50 meters, with an increase of five centimeters.
The height, however, remained unchanged at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in size, the living interior is also expanded.
This advantage stems, on the one hand, from the introduction of a new platform, and, on the other hand, from the introduction of the fuel tank in a central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz model.
In addition, the capacity of the luggage compartment – equipped with a double background – rises to 399 litres, i.e., 19 litres more than the capacity of the first generation.
It should be noted that these are the measurements of the 1.4 engine version, and that the trunk capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Other improvements – in addition to external elements, such as rear LEDs or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass – concern an improvement in the accessibility of the rear seats.
The doors that allow access to the rear positions, in fact, open with an angle of 80 degrees, compared to the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
In addition, the engines in this second generation of jazz are also new.
At the time of commercialization, this small model will be proposed in models with 1.2 and 1.4 litres of gasoline engine.
Both mechanics include i-VTEC technology that reduces consumption, produces less carbon dioxide emissions, optimizes mechanics and at the same time keeps the engine torque high at all its stages.
The 1.2-liter model allows you to use a power of 90 hp at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 rpm.
The propulsion – which in the previous Jazz reached 78 horses – uses 5.3 liters of fuel and produces CO2 emissions of about 125 grams.
Compared to the previous propulsion, which used 83 horses in the first-generation model, there are now 100 available.
The 1.4 to 100 horse Jazz achieves a combination of 5.4 liters of fuel and 128 grams of CO2 emitted.
The "bee car" to avoid collisions
As part of the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan has been inspired, this time, by nature, and especially by bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, taking the flight of bees, for example, knows how to avoid accidents.
It is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which is the first step towards collision prevention technologies.
Engineers from Nissan Motor Co.’s Advanced Technical Center have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Scientific and Technological Research of the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Brand Management Research and Development, the BR23C is an extension of Nissan’s four-area Security Shield.
This robot is intended to improve the ability to prevent collisions in the vehicle of the manufacturer.
During the flight, each bee creates its own personal oval shaped space that is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important thing is the composite eyes of bees, able to see in all directions with an angle of more than 300 degrees, and that allow the insect to fly without interruption in its personal space.
To recreate this visual feature, engineers developed what they called a Laser Range Finder.
This mechanism detects the obstacles facing the BR23C for a radius within two meters and with a maximum width of 180 degrees, calculates the distance from the object, and sends a signal to a edge microprocessor that immediately prevents collision.
"As soon as he detects an obstacle, the small robot mimics the movements of a bee and immediately changes direction by turning on the wheels at a rectangular or larger angle to avoid collision.
The most obvious difference with any assisted system is that the escape maneuver is totally instinctive.
“If it weren’t, the robot wouldn’t be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” said Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot turn upwards or downwards, and even diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction in which it can rotate its wheels and not exploit endless directions and ways as bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotational function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid collisions.
“This device only needs to process the information every few seconds, and to act on the basis of this data.
It does not require the storage of information or the intuitive logic of previous manoeuvres, so it can work without interruption and with just a few dozen KB of memory.
This may surprise you, but we’re not talking about gigabytes of memory, or even mega.”
It is the first step towards the development of new technologies for instant collision prevention, a technology that Nissan hopes will be standard in cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and more durable than lithium-ion batteries.
Another potential future application of this technology could be the integration of units with a GPS satellite navigation system to bring the driver to destination by avoiding the obstacles present in the route.
Trembling before applying for a loan
We must recognize that the U.S. Treasury Department, in addition to owning a lot of capital to intervene, is certainly not without ingenuity.
Faced with the crisis and to prevent Americans from committing rubbish loans to banks with doubtful insolvency, they created a fun and instructive game for network users: "Bad Credit Hotel".
In other words, the "hotel of bad credits"...or problems.
The rich aspect of this accommodation and, in particular, its receptionist serves to induce you to think not one, but two or even three times before applying for a loan.
And, above all, where to do it, which is probably the primary goal.
Certainly the information that the game provides is useful, but it is not detailed.
It’s more a teenage page than a wide audience site.
What happens if you complete the game?
Well, compare a sound room inside the hotel.
It’s still something, because buying a better house doesn’t even talk about it.
Morgan Stanley opens his capital at MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced the signing of an agreement with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan’s first bank, to invest <0x24>9 billion in a 21% stake in the company, news came after a net decline in its shares in the stock market.
A week after the drafting of an interim agreement, the two banks explained that the MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's shares at an individual cost of <0x24>25.25, or <0x24>3 billion.
The fixed price is 19% lower than the accounting value of the securities as of August 31.
MUFG will also invest <0x24>6 billion in the purchase of convertible securities at a conversion price of <0x24>31.25, ensuring a return of 10%.
Morgan Stanley said the global transaction would be based on an average price of <0x24>29 per share, or a percentage lower than its current rate of 28%.
By 5:00 p.m., however, Morgan Stanley's share fell from 6.79 percent to <0x24>23.07.
“This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition into a bank holding company,” said John Mack, CEO of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which should allow her to differentiate her actions by making them go under control of the Federal Reserve.
Its alliance with the MUFG also confirms how the current financial crisis forces Wall Street’s biggest names to take a much more cautious stance than previously assumed.
The terms defined on Monday also show that in the last few days the deal has been modified: on Monday, Morgan simply announced the sale of 20% of its Japanese colossal shares for a sum of <0x24>8.5 billion.
“A week ago, in Tokyo, Toshihide Mizuno, Executive Director of MUFG, explained: “We thought our shareholding would be composed exclusively of ordinary shares.
But given the current situation of the world economy and the market, we have chosen to minimize risks and protect ourselves.”
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will obtain Morgan Stanley securities at a price below their accounting value of 7%.
And the transaction would result in an investment of at least 20% of the equity on a diluted basis.”
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares in one year if, over a given period, the latter were exchanged over 50% below the fixed conversion price, or about <0x24>47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital provided by MUFG would allow it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its budget and increase its liquidity.
A spokesman for the group, however, refused to provide clarification on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
Following the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley is expected to set a Tier One solvency coefficient of about 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said it had "clearly" eased its budget from the end of August.
Over the past few weeks, the group has been putting to the test, which has seen its own shares halve while the cost of risk insurance has undergone a slump.
The cost of Monday's reflow, however, remains at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survival" among the major Wall Street investment banks after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the detection of Merrill Lynch, announced it had raised <0x24>15 billion, partly at the Berkshire Warpothaway group, Bufett.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
Establishing the republic on socialism in the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
On Sunday, following the example of colleagues and friends, it was the latter who gave voice to the draft of a new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since, according to official results, 64% of voters voted "yes" to the referendum, based on 80% votes.
According to these results, the "no" was 28%, while 7% of the votes were null and 0.7% white cards.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, he should get half of the votes, plus one.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the exit of the polls and an estimate of a non-governmental organization had announced a crushing victory of the "yes", placing it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed in the night between Sunday and Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The “Constitution triumphed gloriously,” he had assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians within the governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As always, Chávez and Morales congratulated Rafael Correa, as did his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The scrutiny, which was carried out calmly according to the election observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), was based on a text of 444 points to consolidate the president’s “new socialism.”
This draft Constitution consecrates the state's power over the economy, reserving it with the "planning of development" of a country that lives essentially from the oil extraction carried out by large foreign companies and consequently their currency.
Conceived by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants more power to the head of state, who can be elected for two consecutive four-year terms, to have the opportunity to dissolve the assembly.
Correa has already announced its intention to take advantage of this amendment and to re-apply for a new term in February 2009.
The Constitution also states the freeness of health and education services, which the president has begun to promote in this country of 13.9 million people, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It also bans the presence of foreign troops, a provision that will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for US anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts kidnapped ten days ago.
I'm in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts held captive in the desert for ten days were reported on Monday afternoon, healthy and safe, in the Egyptian capital.
In the morning, they were released in Chad by an Egyptian commando.
Apparently in shape, the hostages arrived at the military base of Almaza, near Cairo International Airport, around 15 and 30 a.m., on board a special aircraft.
On board a helicopter, they were immediately transferred, without being able to release any press interview, to the Maadi hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, to be examined.
They enjoy "good health" and no ransom was paid "to the kidnappers", said on the landing track Egyptian Minister of Tourism Zoheir Garanna.
Abducted on September 19 during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, bordering Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been smashed from one hiding place to the next by 35 unknown hijackers.
The group consisted of 11 tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – and 8 Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of Egypt, the organizing agency of the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the special forces, aboard two helicopters, had launched the assault overnight, just before dawn.
“There have been shootings, half of the kidnappers have been killed, while the others have fled,” the official said.
He explained that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the “lampo” unit were sent to Sudan, where they would be supported by German and Italian commandos.
The Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini stressed, from Belgrade, the importance of the role of the Italian secret agents and special forces.
We must admit that if we have achieved this result it has been thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of the men of our secret services, the special forces," he said, without adding any further details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese patrol army had claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on board of which the hijackers were on board and to have killed six, including the Chadian leader of the hijackers, and to have captured two.
According to the army, the kidnappers would be linked to a Darfur rebel organization, the Sudanese Liberation Movement (SLA_U), a statement immediately denied by the latter.
Letters - The Silent Majority of Culture
On the first page a debate on the financing of culture on which the current election campaign focuses.
So much better.
But a part of our cultural life remains in the shadows.
Who will speak to denounce the misfortunes granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or nationally starving historical sites?
Which politician will dare remind the federal government that is neglecting monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, like in Canada, we don’t have real laws that actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government paid three and a half million euros for the only restoration of Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
To our American neighbors, it is the Constitution that states that the protection of heritage is part of national culture and that the same heritage must be protected by every citizen, every political authority and every government department, and all of this by common accord.
In Quebec, at the Federation of Historical Societies of Quebec, there are at least 40,000 volunteers who, grouped into 211 societies for the preservation of historical, genealogical, archive and heritage assets, preserve, with four money, private archives and archaeological sites.
It is they who often defend our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when real estate entrepreneurs and decision-making bodies attack our forgotten remains and cemeteries with their bulldozers.
When will the right space be reserved for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize part of Fortis bank
The Benelux states are helping through partial nationalisation the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which is in difficulty for the first time in Europe due to the American credit market crisis: the three nations will provide <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.2 billion to the financial institution - insurance with interest also in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands agreed at the highest level over the weekend, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the difficulties in which the international financial market has been debating for more than a year is that of the Fortis bank, and from a certain point of view, the decisions taken in this regard can be a precedent.
According to the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states will hold almost half (49%) of the bank’s share in the country.
The bank will almost certainly sell some of its interests, including first and foremost the assets, especially insurance, of the Dutch ABN Amro acquired a year ago.
Last week, Fortis’ actions had begun with a vertical collapse, and serious signs of the institution’s crisis appeared later in the second half of the week.
However, analysts agree that the bank, with 85,000 employees, is too large to allow it to fail.
The bank's shares on Friday fell almost 12%, the lowest point in 14 years.
Since January, the value of the shares has decreased by more than two-thirds.
Considering the current stock prices, the entire capital value of the group is around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14 billion, but according to the bank’s managers this value is not real.
The corporate summit blames the collapse of Fortis shares for the uncertainties of the extra-European market due to the acceptance of the US <0x24>700 billion plan.
On Monday the title resumed slowly to rise.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed new CEO of the bank.
The financial institution has also sought private buyers but so far no one has presented himself with a merited offer.
The Belgian government had already assured investors that they should not be afraid to lose money.
There was no panic among the bank’s customers, the branches were not assaulted.
In Hungary, Fortis owns autonomous subsidiaries and has also acquired leasing companies.
The Frog in the Chicken
In America, life and health insurers, based on people’s medical purchase data, often refuse to enter into an insurance contract.
Privacy experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a privacy program according to which the use of prescription data of medicines depends in any case on the consent of the person concerned.
This program has to be in independent hands, otherwise it’s like entrusting the chicken to the fox,” writes the Washington Post, citing Richard Dick, the program’s author, to follow the prescriptions of medicines.
Insurers shall subordinate the insurance fee and the amount incurred in case of accidents to the health status of the potential customer and if they consider the risk to be too high they do not undertake insurance.
A long time ago the client had to undergo a medical visit and the contract was concluded only after the outcome of the exam.
Dick 10 years ago invented a much cheaper procedure: based on the customer identification code you can easily get information from pharmacies about which medicines he has bought in the last year and a half, and hence the program shows which diseases he suffers and in which health conditions he is in.
For example, if you regularly buy large amounts of cholesterol reducers this means that your blood fat level is invariably high and is classified in the highest risk category.
There are various versions of the program on the market, some also determine the risk multiplier, so the insurer does not remain much in addition to paperwork, even if there are small difficulties.
Among the contras is that some medicines can be used for multiple purposes, e.g., some compounds are useful against migraines or heatwaves, but they are also effective against depression.
The latter, from an insurance-commercial point of view, is valid as a risk-increasing factor, the first two not.
For the request and data processing companies have formed separately and these, before obtaining the necessary information from pharmacies, ask for the patient's approval.
Now the authorities are obliged to do so even if they have not imposed fines for negligence so far.
Some companies have also recently processed the results of laboratory tests and linked them to drug consumption data in order to provide a more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to the data and in parallel controlling usage will be increasingly difficult.
There is a separate privacy law but its validity extends only to health services and insurance.
In front of Congress there is a bill that gives the authorities the authority to control the companies that specialize in data service.
Richard Dick admits that it is not enough: that is why he has developed a program that connects the data transmission with the consent expressed by the person concerned.
Another issue is that the person concerned cannot so much refuse the approval because otherwise the insurers do not enter into the contract.
So eventually the chickens are entrusted to the clemency of the fox.
Global Marshal Menu
The European Union and India are doubling their trade
Given that the European Union and India are mainly trade partners, the agenda of the ninth summit has also been dominated by this topic, in addition to all other global issues.
Today there will be a Franco-Indian summit that will address cooperation on atomic energy in the first place.
The European Union recognizes that India is becoming a major democratic power to which more voice should be given in international affairs, but the member countries have not yet been able to decide whether to support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
So we did not insist on this issue at the ninth summit held yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as the Union's next president, commission chairman José Manuel Barroso and high representative Javier Solana received Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they found agreement to double in five years, i.e. to increase up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion, trade.
Given that between 2000 and 2007 the trade in goods has increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an overly ambitious target.
As a result, they have legally unified the 26 bilateral civil flight agreements, so air traffic can also take off in the future.
India would like to sign the free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy has promised to speed up the deal.
The goal is to balance because while the EU is India’s first trading partner, New Delhi is only ninth among EU partners.
The summit focused on global issues.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and terrorism, the latter condemned in all its forms by both sides, and called for the convening of a UN conference.
They urged the conclusion of the Doha Round, although both sides played a role in the failure of this.
The EU has confirmed its persistence in the energy and climate programme, i.e. it wants to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agrees on this, as well as on the need to conclude a global pact at the climate conference scheduled for next year and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50% by 2050.
They also want to slow the rise in food prices and have supported the convening of an international meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The Prime Minister of India will travel to the French capital today, where he is preparing to sign a treaty on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is expected that French companies will receive a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 billion commission to build Indian nuclear reactors.
According to information from our press agency, the deal would last 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Book Fair in Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will be present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international event for the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair awaits more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 different countries who will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Fair with over 403,000 titles on display and with Turkey as an honorary guest.
Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian Government in the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Pavilion: Italy will be present institutionally with a point Italy - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will follow the press meeting at Room Structur in Hall 5.0 of the Buchmesse: this will be the opportunity to present figures, trends and perspectives on the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of books by foreign authors gradually decreases on the total Italian production, and in particular on that for adults and young people.
Steve Fossett's plane found as billionaire disappeared a year ago
Steve Fossett's plane debris was found, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada Desert.
The cracks were found on a 3,000-metre-altitude plateau in the Mammoth Lakes Sierra Nevada area, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, however, there were no human remains.
The Madera County sheriff, John Anderson, escaped the doubts that remained: “The plane has been located, we have sent a team, and now we have the confirmation that this is exactly the one Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared,” he said in a press conference.
The sheriff said no human remains were found either on the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was put to death in February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Office (NTSB) has announced that a few hours after the debris was spotted, a team of investigators was sent, which then identified the device: it is the Bellanca 8kcab, which has been displaced since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Nerington.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from the Nevada border, some personal effects of Fossett had been found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with the name Fossett, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a shirt.
Fossett's research had been interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had taken a place in history thanks to a long series of primates.
In 2002, in his sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete the world tour on an aerostatic ball: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he toured the world by air and without escalation.
Among his many records, he also flew 15,445 meters above the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A SUV out of the schemes with an original design and well defined by decisive lines, wide surfaces and clean corners.
This is, in summary, Glk the last born among the offroad "compacts" of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz has been trying to give a glimpse of innovation in this sector.
Just for its contents outside the traditional canons, the communication that will accompany the launch of the Suv Glk, available at the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from October 17th, will also be unexpected and unconventional.
So the advertising battage that will accompany the debut of the new car will launch an unprecedented mode of communication also through a future 3D display campaign, used for the first time in Italy by an automotive brand.
A project of maxi-posters, articulated in three different phases, which will dominate the central street of Milanese shopping, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision and thanks to special glasses distributed near Corso Como it will be possible to see the new SUV in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, when you look at the picture you will have the impression that the car runs out of the manifesto.
Subsequently, through the use of innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, then recombined into a single image.
Undoubtedly, with this advertising, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new in the stereotyped field of automotive communication.
Will this formula be able to stifle the interest of future buyers? We will see.
Here are the Italian hooligans.
From Triveneto, they risk the Daspo.
But who are those 150-200 boys and girls of whom all Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" which has been following the blue national team for years and which, in fact, has never created excessive problems.
He had never fought with his opponents.
The group's extraction is on the right.
Promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
To these in Sofia were added groups (few units, in fact) from Campania and Apulia.
They have tricoloured flags where the militants’ cities of origin appear: Saturday evening they were removed to not be identified.
They are inspired by the English typhoon.
In Bulgaria they found a fanatic of real Nazis, the Levski.
The Figc had made available to Italian fans 144 tickets for the game: all nominative, so easily controllable.
And the Viminale had in fact checked them all: among those matches for Sofia there was no one with a Daspo in progress, no one who had been inhibited from attending a stadium.
In fact, four blue fans, who had a history of stage crimes, had been denied the ticket and prevented the transfer.
Now the Viminale is waiting to read the acts that will arrive from the Bulgarian police then will take measures: in this case, it is possible to give Daspo for at least five years to fans who have been arrested or who have been identified in the disorders.
An international Daspo that prevents you from attending not only Italian stadiums but all over Europe.
Our hooligans, in short, will no longer put foot in a stadium.
Fortunately.
But now there is the fear-emulation: that to those a little more than one hundred and fifty, others will be added.
“We must immediately extinguish this fire and not legitimize those who behave in this way,” they say.
So, "eye well opened especially in view of Wednesday's match at Lecce".
In Apulia there is indeed a small core of supporters of the Ultras Italia.
Tomorrow the Observatory will meet on Tuesday the Casms, which can also count on a section of the Aise, i.e. the secret services, which deals with the problems of the stadium.
"The Duce-Duce choir and the arm stretched during the Mameli hymn? In Bulgaria it is not a crime...".
This is the thought (expressed in a very unhappy way) of Domenico Mazzilli, for a few weeks director of the Viminale Observatory (he took the place that was before Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had previously been the quest of Trieste where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to drown the Duce but certainly the behavior of those 150-200 fans has been shameful.
"I am not the sociologist - adds No. 1 of the Observatory - the crimes are to be attributed in the country where the incident occurs.
Until now this group had remained in line, now we will see clearly what happened and we will evaluate for the future.
But we are also talking about the hiccups in Mameli’s hymn: even those are not a crime, but if you allow me, they are not education...”
