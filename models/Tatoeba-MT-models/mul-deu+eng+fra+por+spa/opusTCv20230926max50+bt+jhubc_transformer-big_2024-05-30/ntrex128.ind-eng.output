Members of Parliament (AM) Welsh are worried when they ‘look like muppets’.
There were concerns among some AMs over a suggestion that their nomination should have been changed to MWPs (Member of Welsh Parliament/Welsh Parliament Members).
This was due to a plan to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
The AMs across the political spectrum are worried that it could invite confusion.
An AM workers' party said that his group was concerned, "The name is senate with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, Twp means crazy and Pwp means dirt.
A member of the assembly (AM) said that his group as a unit, felt "unhappy" and had proposed several alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said that his group was "open-minded" about the name change, but judged that this was a concession from the abbreviation MWP to Muppet.
In this context the letter w in Welsh is pronounced like the letter u in English Yorkshire.
The House commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name change, said: "The final decision on any explanation of the name for the AM is of course a problem for the members themselves."
The Welsh Government's 2017 decision authorised the Welsh Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultation on a proposal known to gain widespread support to call the assembly as the Welsh Parliament.
Regarding the issue of the so-called AMs, the Commission prefers WMPs (Welsh Parliament Members/Welsh Parliament Members), but the MWP option gains the most support in public consultation.
The AMs appear to be proposing alternative options, but the struggle to reach a consensus could stifle the president, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit the bill of the change within a few weeks.
This reform law will include changes - other changes in the way the assembly works, including disqualification rules for AMs and committee system drafts.
The AMs will get a final vote on the question of how they should be called when they discuss legislation.
Macedonians go to vote in referendum on country name change
The voters will decide whether their country's name will be changed to the "Republic of North Macedonia."
The honourable vote was held in an effort to resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece's neighboring country, which also has a province called Macedonia.
Athena has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor indicates a recognition of its territory and has repeatedly rejected the bid to join the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ibanov, an opponent of the vote for the name change, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that the name change was a price to be paid to join the European Union and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin were unruly when the churches in Harlem were in trouble
"Historically, the elders I was talking to said there used to be a bar and a church in every corner," Mr Adam said.
“Today, there is none.”
He said that the disappearance of all the bars could be covered.
"People are socializing in other ways" now, he said.
"The bar is no longer a community living room around where people visit it regularly."
As well as with the church, he was concerned that money from asset sales would not last as long as the leaders expected, "and sooner or later they would return again from the beginning."
The churches, he added, could have been replaced by an apartment building with condominiums filled with people who would not help guard the remaining holy places around them.
"The majority of people who will buy condominiums in these buildings are white people," he said, "and therefore will accelerate the day when these churches are closed at the same time because it is impossible for those who move to those condominiums to become members of these churches."
The two churches were built by the white congregation before Harlem became the metropolis of black people - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist church moved in the 1930s.
The black congregation that had served in the surrounding area had taken over the building.
St. Martin was taken over by the black congregation under the leadership of Reverend John Howard, who led a retailer boycott on 125th street, the main street to shop in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black people.
The fire in 1939 caused the building to be severely damaged, but when the parishioners of Priest Johnson planned to rebuild, they built a tower bell.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Reverend Johnson and his successor in St. Martin proudly called the tower's bell "the bell of the poor"
An expert who concealed the bell of the tower in July gave him another title: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
An expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that this was the first tower bell in the world played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind who alternated to hide the larger tower bell at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin did not replace him.
What has happened in Santo Martin in recent months is a complicated story of architecture and contractors, some brought by public church leaders, and others brought by the Episcopal diocese.
The vestry party - the governing body of the diocese, formed from the public leaders - wrote a letter to the diocese in July with concern that the diocese "would try to charge the cost" on the vestry side, although the vestry was not involved in the recruitment of architects and contractors sent to me.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency from the diocese.
Shark wounds 13-year-old teenager in lobster scuba diving in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he sank to catch a lobster in California at the opening event of the lobster season, an official said.
The attack occurred before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy asking for help and then riding in groups to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just an exaggeration of excitement after catching the lobster, but then he "recognized" that the boy was screaming, "I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
“The whole bone was broken,” Hammel said, realizing that he had caught the child.
"I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' Hammel added.
The boy was flew to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was treated in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Coastal Rescue Captain Larry Giles said at a media conference that a shark had been seen in the area a week earlier, but it was categorized as a harmless shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe injuries to the top of his body.
Authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for the sake of investigation and security.
Giles realizes that there are more than 135 shark species in the region, but most of them are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plan to break the British beauty market
Sainsbury took over Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with toserba style beauty kiosks managed by specialist assistants.
As part of a substantial push towards the UK beauty market worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion, which continues to grow while sales of fashion products and household appliances are declining, larger beauty kiosks will be tested at 11 stores across the country and will be developed into more stores next year if proven.
Investment in the field of beauty is a hunting fair for supermarkets to take advantage of the shelves that were once used as TV displays, microwaves, and household appliances.
Sainsbury said it would double the amount of beauty offerings to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current range of brands starting from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also gain more space with branded areas such as those found in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket also re-launched its store makeup network so that most of its products will be vegan friendly - something that is increasingly in demand by young buyers.
In addition, fragrance retailers will test a concession at the two stores of Sainsbury, the first opened in Croydon. South London last week, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, late this year.
Online shopping and the exchange of buying daily food in small amounts in local grocery stores means that the supermarket must do something more to persuade people to visit.
Mike Coupe, Sainsbury’s chief executive, has said the stores will look increasingly like the Mall as supermarket chains try to counter back pressurers like Aldi and Lidl by providing more and no-food services.
Sainsbury has placed the Argos stores on hundreds of stores and has also introduced several Habitat stores since they bought the two franchises two years ago, which he says has supported daily food sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
Previous supermarket efforts to renovate the beauty and pharmacy department ended in failure.
Sainsbury tested the joint venture with Boots in early 2000, but the collaboration ended after there was a controversy about how to share the profits from the chemical store in the supermarket.
The new strategy emerged after Sainsbury sold 281 pharmaceutical stores to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy franchise, worth <0xC2><0xA3>125 million, three years ago.
It was reported that Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding a variety of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury, said: "We have changed the look and nuances of beauty kiosks to improve the atmosphere for our visitors.
We also invest in trained colleagues who will be ready to offer advice.
Our brand network is designed to fit all the needs, the enchanting environment and the convenient location indicate that we are currently becoming an enchanting destination that challenges the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'shocked' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Den's Dragons star, Peter Jones left 'in a hurry' after TV host Holly Willoughby resigned from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million lifestyle business deal to focus more on her new contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby had no time to manage their household appliance brand and accessories, True.
The couple's business is similar to the Goop brand owned by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old host used his Instagram account to announce that he was out.
Holly Willoughby has made the stars of Dragons" Den, Petes Jones is angry at pulling herself out in the last moments, of their lucrative lifestyle business - to focus on her larger contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources state that Jones was so "shrewd" when the golden TV girl admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at her business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deal - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - meant she no longer had enough time to devote herself to a home brand and brand.
Their business has been paired with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby's fortune by <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of Britain to one of his holiday homes.
A source said: "Truly so far is Holly's most important priority.
It will be his long-term future, which will keep him alive for decades to come.
His decision to retreat made everyone involved truly astonishing.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, very close to the time of launch.
There's a warehouse full of stuff in Marlow's main office that's ready for sale."
Experts believe the event's departure, which is one of Britain's most expensive stars, could cost the company up to millions of dollars due to large investments in product forms, ranging from pillows and candles to home clothes and appliances, as well as the potential for further delays in launch.
And this could mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
The mother of three children, Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been very close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Willoughby founded True together with Capp in 2016, and the 52-year-old Jones joined as chairman in March.
The couple are on vacation together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin’s TV production company.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of the ITV show I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night "We will not comment on this business relationship."
Seriously “and then we fell in love”
He was joking about the criticism he would receive from the news media for making comments that some consider "non-presidential" and have been very positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in a joke that his "news reader" was his.
"I don't give up anything."
He learned that Kim was interested in meeting for the second time after a previous meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump praised as a step forward for North Korea’s denuclearization.
But denuclearization negotiations have stopped.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea's highest diplomat Ri Yong Ho spoke to world leaders in. The UN General Assembly on Saturday said that North Korea saw no "appropriate response" from the United States to the early North Korean truce movement.
Instead, he noted, the United States remains continuing sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump is more optimistic in his speech.
"We are doing our best with North Korea," he said.
"If we're at war with North Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
Now we have this amazing relationship."
He said that his success in improving relations with Kim had brought positive results - stopping rocket experiments, helping to free the hostages and returning the remaining American soldiers to their homes.
And he defended his unusual approach in talking about relationships with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but compared to having 10,000 outsiders trying to get into this crowded arena, we'd better have about 200 people standing there," Trump said, pointing towards the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami in Indonesia and Earthquake Destroyed an Island, Killing Hundreds of People
As a result of the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-government foreign organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population lost their homes, there was no national disaster statement, as a prerequisite for bringing international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they did not ask for international help, so this is a bit challenging," Mrs. Subung said.
While Save The Children is assembling a team to leave for Palu, it is still uncertain whether foreign staff can work on the field.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster prevention body, said Indonesian officials were reviewing the situation in Palu to see if foreign agencies were allowed to contribute to provide assistance.
Given Indonesia’s continuous earthquakes, the country is still very unprepared to face natural anger.
While a tsunami shelter has been built in Aceh, it is not a common sight on the other coastline.
There is no tsunami warning siren in Palu, although the danger warning has been reported, it is likely to have contributed to the presence of fatalities.
At the best of times, travelling among many Indonesian islands is very challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
The hospice hospital that has been placed in Lombok to care for earthquake victims is heading to Palu, but will take at least three days to reach a new disaster location.
President Joko Widodo has made damaged Indonesian infrastructure repairs as the core of the election campaign, and he has spent money on the construction of highways and railways.
But the lack of funds has disrupted Joko's administration while he faces re-election next year.
Joko’s father also faced pressure from the ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim majority members have embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands fled their homes as Muslim and Christian gangs fought in the streets, using bows, arrows, and other sharp weapons.
Watch: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scores a goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat against Chelsea in the Premier League with one score at the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 metres from outside Chelsea's goal when his team was behind 1-0.
He put the ball on his left side before kicking him in the direction of the far pole.
The ball blooms high above the goal when the ball blooms to the top right corner of the net.
The ball eventually fell past Kepa Arrizabalaga who jumped and fell into the net.
"It's just trying to get into that position, to control the ball, and players like Shaq always play it forward as much as possible, so I'm just trying to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and take one chance and don't think too much about it, and just do a kick."
Chelsea led by 1-0 in the first half after Belgian forward Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blue's attacker gave Mateo Kovacic feedback on the game, before turning near the midfielder and running fast to the midfielder Liverpool.
Kovacic quickly feeds and runs in the middle line.
He then made a perfect kick, leading Hazard towards the goal.
Hazard managed to pass the opponent's defender and kicked the ball to the corner of the goal with a left foot kick, passing Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool against Naples in the Champions League group semi-finals at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea faced Videoton in the UEFA European League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Indonesian tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has increased to 832, state disaster agencies said Sunday morning.
Many people are reportedly trapped in the collapse of a building that was destroyed by a 7.5-scale Richter earthquake that struck on Friday and triggered a 20-foot-high wave, said Sutopo Purwo, a spokesman for the agency at a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has a population of more than 380,000, is filled with debris of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was beaten to death.
A murder investigation has been conducted after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found in Grayson Mews, John Street, at 7.55 a.m. with several stab wounds, while a 32-year-old man was detained on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked people around who saw or heard something to come across.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still at an early stage but I ask everyone around John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also refer to everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the dashboard camera to contact us because they may have important information for our investigation.
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead and she was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who felt confident that they knew the woman had come to the scene to ask about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is still ongoing, as police have said, they are in the process of informing the victim's closest relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just returned to his apartment, but is told by police that no one is allowed to enter or exit the building.
The man couldn’t say anything when he found out what was going on.
Currently, citizens are being told that it will take a few hours until they are allowed back in.
A police officer was heard telling someone that all areas are now being treated as the scene of the incident.
A woman appeared at the location in a state of crying.
He always repeated “this is really terrible.”
At 2 p.m. two police vans were in line and the other were outside.
A number of officers stood in line to monitor the blocks of the apartment.
Anyone with information is asked to send a message directly to <0x40>MerPolCc, call 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 citing log 247 on September 30.
Cromwell's Parliamentary Statue Becomes the Last Memorial to Rewrite History
It would be a poetic justice for the destruction of the al-Taliban against many British cultural and religious artefacts carried out by fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell community described Mr. Crick's advice as "stupid" and "trying to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, head of the Cromwell Society, said: "It is inevitable in the current debate about the destruction of the statues, that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace will be the target.
The iconoclasm of the British Civil War was neither commanded nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell offspring would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The remarkable representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a 19th-century proof of opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a parliamentary defender against external pressure, in his case of course the kingdom.
Is it a fully accurate representation, still being the subject of a continuous historical debate?
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century has shaped the development of the next nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure representing one side of the difference.
His success as a Protector Master is also worth celebrating and remembered."
Pig killer cheats Chinese farmers to death
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a southeastern Chinese market, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his nickname "Yuan", was found dead with a broken, bloody artery near a pork cage in a market in the Liupanshui district of Guizhou province, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepared to inject the vaccine to pigs at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining province of Qinghai, China.
He was reported to have gone with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Thursday to sell 15 pork shells in the market.
The next day, his cousin finds him dead, and seeing the nearby pork cage door open.
He said that in a pig cage there was a large male pig with blood in his mouth.
Forensic research confirms that the male pig weighed 550 pounds had persecuted the farmer until his death, according to reports.
"My cousin Betis is bleeding and shattered," said the cousin known as "Wu", as quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40pm on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been jailed to prevent it from attacking others, while police collected evidence at the scene.
The Yuan family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks on humans have also occurred before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts resulting in the man being seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig squeezed a Welsh farmer into his tractor until his wife frightened him and drove him out.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pig in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that the pig is usually not aggressive but the blood scent can act as a "trigger".
“They’re just playing.
They're biting, curiously curious... they're not going out to hurt you.
You just need to give him enough respect," he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa brought heavy rain to the southwest of the United States.
As expected, Hurricane Rosa weakened as it moved over cooler waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
Anyway, Rosa will cause flooding throughout the northern and southwestern regions of Mexico in the coming days.
Rosa has winds at a speed of 85 mph, Storm Category 1, starting at 5 a.m. Sunday time Eastern Region, and is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is likely to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, Palung began to form over the Pacific Ocean and moved east, towards the US West Coast. As Rosa approached the California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm and began pushing tropical humidity north to the US southwest.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical moisture that interacts with nearby mudslides will create heavy rains that will spread in the Southwest over the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause hazardous flooding, debris flows and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
Low tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates to approach 2 to 3 inches per hour at some point, especially in the southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
It is estimated that 2 to 4 inches of rain falls in some parts of the Southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Floods are likely to occur with conditions that deteriorate rapidly due to the nature of the scattered tropical rainfall.
It is not recommended to explore the desert on foot due to the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can cause the gap to become violent rivers and storms will bring local and dusty strong winds.
A nearby slope would cause local heavy rain to some of the southern California coastline.
Total rainfall exceeding half an inch is sufficiently possible, which can cause small debris to flow and the highways to become smooth.
This will be the first rainfall in the region during their rainy season.
Some widespread tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona by the end of Sunday and Monday morning, before rains become more widespread on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to four corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
In October there will be some major temperature changes across the U.S. as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropical areas remain warm enough.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
There is an exact example of dramatic temperature differences throughout the central U.S. region on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will form and spread again.
Most central and eastern U.S. regions are expected to start warming in October with speeds spreading by 80s from the South Plateau to Northeastern parts.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is estimated to be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecasts show high chances for above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. to mid-October.
More than 20 million people have witnessed the trial of Brett Kavanaugh.
More than 20 million people witnessed an interesting statement on Thursday by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused her of alleged sexual violence in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political blockade continued, with broadcasters pausing regular events to announce an unexpected incident at the last minute on Friday: A deal designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that the woman was 100 percent sure if Kavanaugh was drunk and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his fiery testimony, said that he was 100 percent sure it didn’t happen.
There are probably more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday, have watched it.
The company counted average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Counting for other networks that broadcast this is not readily available, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually had trouble counting the number of people who watched him in the office.
To put this in perspective, it is the number of spectators that is almost the same as a playoff football or Academy Awards match.
Fox News Channel, whose hosts' opinion strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, outperformed all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers throughout the day, Nielsen said.
ABC ranks second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million viewers and CNN with 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Fans remain high after the trial.
Flake was a key figure in Friday's drama.
After a moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would vote in support of Kavanaugh, he was caught by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning being screamed by protesters as he tried to take the elevator to a Justice Committee hearing.
He stood down for a few minutes when he was shaved off the maki, broadcast live on CNN.
“I stand right in front of you,” said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the state?
She was told, "You have the power when there are many helpless women."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator closed, that there were many other things he had to say in committee hearings.
Cable TV and broadcasting networks all covered live a few hours later, when the Judiciary Committee would vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination throughout the Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do that with the understanding that the FBI would check the charges against the candidate for the next week, as has been requested by the minority Democrats.
Flake has been persuaded in part by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with the Coons and several senators thereafter, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice had power, as it was clear that the Republican party would not have a vote to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation on charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Accuses Critics of 'Playing Politically' on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of "playing politics" with Britain's future and damaging national interests, for her plans to leave the European Union, in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, England, September 29, 2018.
In another interview, after one of the interviews that featured him on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson stressed the attack on what he called the Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal about Britain and the EU to collect tariffs on each other was "completely unreasonable."
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in the death of LSU player.
Police have arrested a suspect in a fatal shooting that resulted in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and imprisoned on two-tier murder charges, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said the Sims lost his eyeglasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on the item, the WAFB CBS affiliate reported.
After interrogating Simpson, police said that he confessed to having carried out a fatal shooting on Wayde.
His contract has been set at <0x24>350,000, the Advokat reported.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's office released a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of the death was a gunshot wound in the head to penetrate into the neck.
The department thanked the fugitive task force of the Louisiana State Police, state police criminal lab, Southern University police and surrounding citizens in assisting the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU athletics director Joe Alleva thanked the regional law enforcement for "sustainability and the search for justice."
Sims was 20 years old at the time.
With a height of 6.6 feet living in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne also played basketball for the LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and jumped to 2.6 in last season's game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said his team felt "destroyed" and "surprised" by Wayde's death.
“That’s what you’re worried about all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano sweeps ashes in Mexico City
The ash that emerged from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern area around the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from volcanoes after increased activity in the crater and registered 183 gas and ash emissions in more than 24 hours.
The center monitored the noise and vibration several times.
Images on social media show a thin layer of ash sticking to the car windshield in the surroundings of Mexico City.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in activity in volcanoes 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
It is known as "Don Goyo" which has been active since 1994.
Police clashed with Catalan separatists ahead of the independence election celebrations.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after participants of a pro-independence demonstration clashed with anti-government police, and when thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first celebration of Catalonia's polarization vote on secession.
A masked pro-separatist group held by the anti-hero police battered them with eggs and threw powder paint, thus creating a dark dust cloud on the streets that would normally be filled by tourists.
The dispute also occurred later that day with the presence of police who used their rods to control the dispute.
For several hours, pro-independence groups shouted "No forgetting, no forgiveness" in front of the union protesters who shouted, "Living Spain."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries obtained in the protest, local press reported.
Tensions remained high in this independent-oriented region, a year after the October 1 referendum that Madrid considered illegal but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters prefer to be free, although the number of voters is low with those who oppose secession and mostly boycott elections.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting in the TPS across the region in intense clashes.
Pro-independence groups have camped overnight on Friday to prevent demonstrations in order to support the national police.
The demonstrations continued but were forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended separatist protests with his wife, said he no longer hoped for Catalonia's prospect of independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry for joy to be able to choose, but now we’re trapped,” he said.
Although it succeeded in a vital victory although little in last December's regional elections, the Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain the momentum this year despite many of their well-known leaders, who are in isolation or in prison awaiting the conference, for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declarations.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded protests with her phone to support the police, said the conflict had been triggered by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting tense now," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders imprisoned pre-trial since late last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament elections next year.
"Standing as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the decline in the values of democracy and the oppression that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: How many men were arrested after a house was hit by a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car repeatedly hit a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage occurred to the gate and the building itself.
A cross arc may also have been shot in the direction of the car at some point.
The goal scored by Menga has given Livingston a victory over the Rangers with a score of 1-0.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livingston's victory resulted in the Rangers resigning Steven Gerrard from his position as Ibrox club manager, for his second loss in 18 games.
Dolly Menga's attack has been evidence of a difference when Gary Holt's side movement is equal to the Hibernian who is in second place.
Gerrard's side remained without victory in the Premiership this season and faced the Hearts leader who was eight points ahead of them, next Sunday.
Earlier, the Rangers took over Rapid Vienna in the European League, on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, extended their unbeaten record in the division to six games, while head coach Holt is still losing since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses his chance against a sloppy guest team
The Holt team was supposed to have excelled long before they scored, with their accuracy giving the Rangers various difficulties.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but his attempt failed across the face of the goal, then Alan Lithgow could only broaden his effort after sliding in and facing Craig Halkett's kick from across the goal.
The hosts are satisfied to let the Rangers play superior in the beginning, knowing that they can complicate the team of foreigners over the occurrence of the dead ball.
And that’s how to score a very important goal.
Rangers conceded a free kick and Livingston got a chance, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to help Menga, who got a turn and scored a goal from the middle of the field.
At that stage, the Rangers had dominated the dominance but realized that the host's defense could not be penetrated and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly was overall uninterrupted,
The pattern continued until the second half, although Alfredo Morelos managed to catch the rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was held by the leg of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow far removed as a result of other Livingston game tactics.
The attack continued to come to Livingston's goal and was continuously avoided, while two penalty claims - after Halkett's challenge to Glenn Middleton's replacement, and one for handball - were rejected.
'Fenomenal' from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Performance and phenomenal results for Livingston.
For a man, they are amazing, continuing to exceed expectations on this ever-increasing track.
Their playing style and staff have barely changed since they returned to the top board, but big credits had to be given to Holt for the way he strengthened the team since his arrival.
He's got so much toys.
Captain Halkett was very big, leading a well-organized defense, while Menga made Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall keep alert throughout the game.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
As good as they were at the time under Gerrard, they failed to meet that standard.
Their last ball was less good – only once they could break the host’s side formation – and it was a warning to the Rangers, who were aware of their presence in the middle of the field.
Erdogan received a variety of welcomes in Cologne.
There was a smile and a bright blue sky on Saturday (September 29) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
They argue about issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkey’s entry into the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a new major mosque.
It is home to the largest population of Turks outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters moved around to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - also voted, denouncing both, Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The protests depicted a contradiction in the existence of a foreigner who was welcomed as a hero by some German Turks and sought as a dictator by others.
Crash on Deptford highway: Bicycle rider killed in collision with car
A cyclist was killed in a collision involving a car in London.
The collision occurred near Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a crowded street in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car had stopped and paramedics arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The collision occurred months after another cyclist died in a runway on Childers Street, about a mile away from Saturday's collision.
Metropolitan police said the officers were trying to identify the man and alert his family.
The roads were closed and the bus routes were diverted and motorists were forced to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in riots
Six people were injured in a riot in a man's prison with strict care, the office said.
Chaos arose at HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST (GMT<0x2B>0100) on Sunday and was still ongoing.
Specialist officers "Tornado" have been deployed to deal with the raid, which involved eight detainees and occurred on one side of the building.
Officers were treated at the scene of the incident due to mild injuries to the face.
A prison spokesman said: "Specially trained deputy officers have been deployed to deal with the incident that is taking place in HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six officers have been treated for injuries.
We do not ment violence in this prison, and it is clear that the responsible will be handed over to the police and may have to spend more time behind bars."
The HMP Long Lartin prison accommodates more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous prisoners.
In June it was reported that the head of the prison was hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October of last year an anti-money laundering officer was summoned to prison to deal with a serious craving where an off-the-shelf officer was attacked with a billiard ball.
Pink Storm Threatened Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with Floods (Drought Area May Benefit)
Tropical depressions that hit Arizona are rare, but that’s what’s most likely to happen early next week as the remaining energy footprint of Hurricane Rosa passes through the southwestern desert, causing a risk of flooding.
National Weather Service has issued warnings of flooding on Monday and Tuesday for areas of West Arizona to southern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to lead directly past Phoenix on Tuesday, will hit on Monday night accompanied by rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix mentioned on Twitter that there are only "ten tropical hurricanes capable of causing tropical storms or depression status in the 200 miles of the Phoenix region since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a storm within 40 miles of the AZ border region."
The latest Hurricane Center tool is able to predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall with an isolated amount reaching 6 inches in the Arizona Rim Mogollon.
Other southwestern regions including the central Rockies and the Great Basin are most likely to be affected by 1 to 2 inches, with the possible amount of isolation reaching 4 inches.
For those in the flood-free region, Rosa rain may be a blessing because the region is hit by drought.
Although flooding is a serious problem, some of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial as the southwestern region is currently undergoing drought.
According to the U.S. drought observers, only about 40 percent of Arizona’s territory is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second highest category,” weather.com reported.
First, the line that crosses Hurricane Rosa leads to land across the California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still at storm power on Sunday morning at a wind speed of 85 miles per hour, 385 miles north of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm encountered colder waters in the Pacific and that is why its strength was weakened.
Therefore, it is expected to land in Mexico with tropical storm force on Monday afternoon or night.
Rainfall may be high in parts of Mexico, causing a high risk of flooding
"The total rainfall of 3 to 6 inches is expected to hit the California region of Baja to the southwestern region of Sonora, likely up to 10 inches," weather.com reported.
Rosa would then cross the northern part of Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which would pass through Arizona and to southern Utah on Tuesday midnight.
"The main risk likely to be caused by Hurricane Rosa or its remains is very high rainfall in Baja California, the northwestern region of Sonora, and the southwestern U.S. desert region of the U.S."
The rains are expected to cause the threat of flooding and building debris flowing into the desert, and the occurrence of landslides in the mountainous region.
Norton Midsomer Attack: Arrest of Four Suspected Attempted Murder
Three young men and a 20-year-old man were arrested for alleged attempted murder after a 16-year-old man was found with a skull wound in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace Midsomer Norton area, around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital where he was in a “stable” condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock, Avon and Somerset regions, police said.
Officers have already told anyone who might have video footage of the incident on their phone to come and report.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'received hatred and anger' from the Democratic Party
"One vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the brutal and embarrassing investigation of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "received hatred and anger" from the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, forcibly and emotionally denying a charge from Christine Blasey Ford that she committed sexual violence to her decades ago while they were still a teenager.
Ford also testified at the trial about his statements.
The president said on Saturday that "Americans saw the intelligence and quality and courage of Kavanaugh on that day.
"One vote of support for Judge Kavanaugh is the vote to confirm someone who has the most perfect legal thought of our time, a jury with a record of true public servants," he said.
The president implicitly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when talking about the importance of Republican participation in mid-election.
“Five weeks before the election was one of the most important elections in our lives.
I’m not running, but I’m really running,” he said.
"That's why I went there to come, fighting for a great candidate.
Trump argues that Democrats are on a mission to “fight and block.”
The first procedural vote at Senate level in Kavanaugh's candidacy is expected to be implemented by Friday at the latest, a senior aide to the GOP leader said on CNN.
Hundreds of people died from Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, with the number of casualties increasing
At least 384 people were killed, many of whom were struck when a giant wave struck the coast, when a devastating earthquake and tsunami struck Indonesia's island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach celebration in the city of Palu on Friday when a six-meter (18-foot) wave destroyed the beach at noon, causing many deaths and destroying whatever it went through.
Tsunami followed by an earthquake with a force of 7.5.
"When the threat of a tsunami rose yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not immediately run away until they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Disaster Response Agency (BNPB) said at a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, he pulled cars, wood, houses, stranded everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had passed offshore at a speed of 800 km/h (497 mph) before stranding the coastline.
Some people climbed trees to save themselves from the tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 service centers in Palu.
Air photos issued by the BNPB show many buildings and shops destroyed, bent and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
A follow-up quake shook the city along the beach on Saturday.
Earthquake rates are felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Agency for Research and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released on Friday's mass earthquake was about 200 times stronger than the atomic bomb power dropped in Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical location of the city, which is at the end of a long narrow bay, could enlarge the size of the tsunami, can be said to be that.
Nugroho described the damage that occurred as "extensive" and stated that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been destroyed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the ruins of the destroyed building, he said, adding that there were 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could have been greater along the 300 km (190 miles) coastline north of Palu, a region called Donggala, which is closer to the earthquake center.
Communication "completely stalled by the absence of information from Donggala," Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its members and volunteers were heading to the disaster-affected region.
“It’s a tragedy, but it could get worse,” he said.
The related authorities received many criticisms on Saturday for not informing that there was a tsunami hitting Palu, although authorities said the waves had already hit at the time the warning was issued.
An amateur footage shared on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building sounding a panic warning of an imminent tsunami, towards the people on the street below.
Within minutes, the water rolls off the beach, stirring up buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately prove the authenticity of the recording.
Earthquakes and tsunamis are the biggest causes of electrical shutdowns that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has already begun to deliver cargo aircraft containing aid from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but the refugees are still in dire need of food and other basic necessities.
The airport has been reopened only to channel aid efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit an evacuation center in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesian Tsunami victims have risen to more than 800.
That's very terrible.
When the World Vision officials from Donggala had successfully arrived in the city of Palu, where the officers sheltered in the canvas tents built in their office yards, on their way they had passed through various areas that were ravaged, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me that they had seen many houses destroyed," he said.
That's terrible.
Even as the group of donors began to move slowly to start disaster prevention activities, some of the group complained of harassment against skilled foreign volunteers, who wished to go to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, financing, goods and energy aid from abroad can only begin to be disbursed if the affected area has been officially declared as a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial level disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says, ‘OK, this is a national disaster,’ we can accept International aid, but there is no such status.”
On the second night after the earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and families of the missing victims still hope that their loved ones will be part of the miracle that will improve the course of the dark story of the natural disaster.
On Saturday, a boy was taken out of the goat.
On Sunday, the rescuer took out a woman trapped under the debris for two days with the mother's body next to him.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national parachute team, has been the coach of two missing parachute athletes, who were able to attend the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Those still trapped in Hotel Roa-Roa, along with Father Mandagi, were his disciples.
“As a senior in the field of paragliding, I have my personal emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon's father recounted how after news of the ruined Roa-Roa Hotel circulated around the parachute community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to Palu's competitors, who took part in the celebrations on the beach.
However, all of his messages, received only one gray stamp, rather than two blue stamps.
"I think that means the message was not sent," he said.
Thieves take <0x24>26,750 during ATM charging at Newport in Levee
The burglar on Friday morning stole <0x24>26,750 from a Brink officer who was refilling an ATM machine storage box in Newport, according to reports from the Newport Police Department.
The car driver has already emptied an ATM machine in the entertainment complex and is preparing to deliver more money, Det. Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While he was working, another man "runs from behind Brink's worker" and steals a bag containing the money to be sent.
Eyewitnesses saw some suspects fleeing the scene, according to reports, but police did not mention the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity can contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Announced the name change via Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The former was formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has had the nickname Ye for some time and uses the name as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change was made before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, when he was expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
She replaced singer Ariana Grande to perform on the show, which was cancelled for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
As an abbreviation for his current professional name, West had previously said that for him the word had a religious meaning.
"I believe 'yes' is a common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year, discussing the title of the album with Radio Big Boy.
“So I’m you, I’m us, that name’s us.
The name was taken from Kanye, which means only one, to be Ye – as a mirror of our good, our bad, our confusion, all.
The album is more a reflection of our true self.”
He was one of a number of rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs has in various ways been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the name Love and Brother Love.
Former West collaborator, JAY-Z also made it with or without a connecting sign and Big letter.
Mexico's president, AMLO, vows not to use the military in the face of civil society
President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has sworn he will never use military force against civil society before the 50th anniversary of bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised a day on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never use military force to pressure the Mexicans."
The forces fired on peacefully held demonstrations in the plaza on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at the time, when left-wing student movements embedded their roots throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has already secured support for young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to those in college and opening more universities for free.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities encouraged young people to form criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double the funding of the A.I.
As China is more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. is expected to double the amount of funds that will be used for research in the field, said A2 investors and practitioners Kai-Fu Lee, who already worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments came after various parts of the U.S. government made an announcement about AI, even when the U.S. overall lacked a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: aiming to be number 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
“Delaying AI research funds is a good start, given that all other countries tend to be far behind the U.S., and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
Deferring funds could double the odds so that the next major AI achievements will be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lea, the owner of the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has already invested in one of the leading AI companies in China, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he designed an AI system that defeated the best American Othello players, and after that he served as an executive at Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee acknowledged earlier U.S. government technology competitions such as the Robotics Challenge for the Advanced Defense Research Project and asked when the next activities would be carried out, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win prizes from the Government, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes the academic lead; it's the company," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have already hired university figures for AI research in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. to support efforts around AI.
"I think green cards can be offered automatically to holders of a PHD degree in the field of AI," he said.
The Chinese National Council issued its next-generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese Natural Science Foundation provides funds for people in academic institutions just like the way the Natural Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic tasks is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year in the U.S. Department of Defense developed a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to involve industrial and academic partners, and the White House announced the formation of the Selection Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA (Advanced Defence Research Agency) announced a <0x24>2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
For the NSF, DARPA recently invested more than <0x24>100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation that requested the establishment of the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence saw no follow-up for months.
Macedonians vote to change the country's name
The Macedonian people held a vote on Sunday to decide to change the country's name to "North Macedonia Republic," an action that would resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece that has stifled its membership bid to become a part of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbor represents the recognition of ownership of its territory and has banned the country from joining NATO and the European Union.
Both government sides reached an agreement in June on the basis of the new name proposed, but the nationalist opposition argued that the change would damage the identity of most ethnic Slavic Macedonian populations.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not cast his vote at the general election and a boycott campaign has raised doubts as to whether the election results could reach the minimum amount of 50 percent needed for the election to be declared legitimate.
The question on the ballot reads: "Do you agree to NATO and EU membership by accepting an agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that it was a decent price to pay to get permission to enter into bodies such as the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries born from the destruction of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young Macedonian generation so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because that means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, quite a few MPs say they will comply with the voting results to make a decision.
A name change requires a two-thirds vote in parliament.
The state election commission said there were no reports of violations until 1 p.m.
However, the results of the vote reached only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters gave their ballots.
"I came to give my vote for my children, where we are in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko gave their ballot for the Macedonian general election in order to change the name of the country that will pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, has already prepared a small stage and pulling chairs in front of tents made by those who would boycott the vote.
"We agree to join NATO and the European Union, but we want to join honorably, not through the door of the server," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can switch to China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asia integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring more investment needed for Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I believe most of the population will agree with it because more than 80 percent of our society supports the European Union and NATO,” Zaev said.
He said the result "yes" would be "confirming our future."
A poll published by the Macedonian Policy Research Institute on Monday stated that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the vote - less than the required amount.
Another poll, hosted by TV station Telma Macedonia, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to participate in their votes on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the vote to be successful, it takes 50 percent plus 1 vote.
A failure in the vote would represent the first policy rejection against the pro-Western government since taking over in May last year.
Witness: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City explored all of Brighton's defenses to score.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were deployed as Brighton's defense on Manchester City's 2–0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium, Manchester, England.
Aguero made the win look very easy on his score in the minute 65.
Argentina's attacker received an opera in the middle of the field at the start of the game.
He ran between the three defenders of Brighton, before nectar entered the open field.
Aguero then finds himself surrounded by four green-haired men.
He turned past one defender before running ahead of several more opponents at the end of Brighton's goal.
Then he leaned to his left, to Sterling.
The English forward took advantage of his first kick from the goal direction to kick the ball back to Aguero, who used his right leg to defeat Brighton goalkeeper, Mathew Ryan with a kick to the right side of the goal.
"Aguero is struggling with some problems in his legs," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We’re talking about him who played for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at the time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues an early advantage in the Premier League fight.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball, far within the Brighton region on that game.
He kicked the ball with a stunning far blow through the left wing to Leroy Sane.
Sane did a little kicking the ball before leading Sterling to the farthest post.
Sky Blue forwards slid the ball towards the goal just before the ball slid out of the border.

Scherzer to file a Spoiler vs. Rockies
With the Nationals being eliminated from the playoff match, there was no reason to impose another match.
But Scherzer, who is too competitive, hopes to be able to outsmart the Colorado Rockies in the game on Sunday, but only if there is still a playoff implications for the Rockies, who outscored in one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
The Rockies have at least won a spot after winning in a wild-card game against the Nationals with a 5-2 score on Friday night, but are still trying to win their first division title.
"While we are playing without winning, at least we can get to know the atmosphere in this Denver with a crowd of spectators and other teams that will compete at the highest level of any point I may face this year.
How could I not want to compete in such a game?”
The Nationals have not announced the opening match for Sunday, but it is reported that in such circumstances, they tend to allow Scherzer to compete.
Scherzer, who will start the game for the 34th time, will hold a training session on Thursday and start a Sunday match that is usually used to rest.

Trump is campaigning in West Virginia.
The president implicitly referred to the situation concerning the candidate of the Supreme Court Judge of his choice, Brett Kavanaugh when discussing the importance of Republican public votes in the middle of the election.
"Every effort we have made is at stake in November.
Five weeks before the most important election in our lives.
This is one of the big, big -- I'm not really running that's why I'm fighting everywhere for an amazing candidate," he said.
Trump continued, “You see a radical Democratic group that’s terribly frightening, you can see it’s happening right now.
And they decide to take back power in any way, you see their evils, their abominations.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to hurt in order to gain power and control, that’s what they want, that’s power and control, we won’t give it to them.”
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to “reject and block.”
"And you've seen that for the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "rageful and evil and ugly and unbelievable."
She referred to the Senate Dianne Feinstein who served on the Senate Judiciary Committee by mentioning her name, which was welcomed with a warm welcome from her listeners.
"Do you remember the answer?
Did you leak those documents?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I'm waiting for it - it's a very bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a place of public service.
He is now intolerant of anyone who puts his mind to it.
When Momentum activists at the local party gave me a vote to condemn myself, it was not surprising.
After all, I am in the last order of MEPs, who are told that our presence is not expected - all because we are expressing opinions.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, received similar treatment because she strongly defended anti-Semitism.
In my case, the condemnation movement criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policies, on national security, in Europe, the issue is ironically the same as that of Jeremy Corbyn with the previous leader.
An announcement for the East Nottingham workers' meeting on Friday stated that "we want the meeting to be inclusive and productive."
For almost eight years I was a member of the local Labour Parliament, the General Committee meeting on Friday night was exactly that.
Unfortunately today, the nature of many meetings and promises about a "better, more friendly" policy has long been forgotten, if, indeed it ever began.
Differences in the Labour Party are becoming increasingly intolerable and each opinion is assessed by the party's authority.
It started as soon as Jeremy became a leader, as a colleague I once thought would be able to share the same political viewpoint, beginning to expect me to retreat and accept positions that I would never want to accept — both in the national security and the single market of the European Union.
Whenever I speak openly – and no matter what I say – then then there will be a social media referendum that asks for the cancellation of appointments, complaining about central politics, saying to me that I should not serve in the Labour Party.
And it wasn’t just me who experienced it.
Of course, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments directed at me tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and limitations of my colleagues who faced sexual harassment or racism every day but never avoided it.
One of the most disappointing aspects of today’s political era is how far abuse has been deemed reasonable.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party was supposed to help develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer in a wider church and with every “untrustworthy” motion or turn the selection of party rules into more limited.
I got a lot of advice over the last two years that encouraged me to keep my head down, not too much voice of opinion, and then I would say "okay."
But I jumped into politics not to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago when I was still a school student, provoked by the neglect of Thatcher's government which resulted in my comprehensive school class literally collapsed, I have tried to fight for a better public service for those in need - both as a local counselor and the interior ministry.
I never concealed my political actions, including in the last election.
No one in East Nottingham will question my policy position and the things I do not agree with in the current leadership.
For those who advocate Friday’s motion, what I can say is that when the country moves quickly toward the split of sovereignty (Brexit), it will jeopardize our state businesses and public services, I don’t want to waste time and energy for loyalty to Labour leaders.
But really, one message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my constituents, as a member of the Labour Party or not. I am proud to serve you and I promise that there is no threat of resignation or any political policy that will prevent me from doing what I believe is in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38–17 Melrose: The invincible Ayr rose to top position
The last two attempts may have tricked a bit into the final result, but no doubt Ayr deserved to win a very entertaining Tennent's Premiership game today.
Now they are in the top ranks, the only invincible party out of ten.
In the end, their superior defense, and the ability to get the best chance, which makes the host team and coach Peter Murchie get the right to feel happy.
"So far we've tested our game, and we're still unbeaten so we're happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "The awards for Ayr, they are better at taking chances than we do."
Grant Anderson's experiment in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, placed Ayr ahead, but the yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, given on the game by the Warriors, gave Melrose the chance to score and Jason Baggot crashed an unconverted experiment.
Climo slowed Ayr's leadership by a penalty, before, right in the middle of the time, he scored a goal then made a single attempt to make Ayr's score 17-5 at the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's experiment changed by Baggot, reducing the odds by up to five points.
Then there was a long break as Ruaridh Knott suffered serious injuries, was kicked out, and since the start of the game, Ayr ran faster beyond Stafford McDowall's experimental effort, altered by Climo.
Captain Ayr Blair Macpherson was then exposed to a yellow card and again, Melrose made a backup player pay with Bruce Colvine's unchanged experiment, at the end of the hard pressure.
The host has returned to play, however, by the time Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for covering Climo without the ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson arrived behind Ayr's advanced injured.
Climo was replaced, as once again, almost from the start of the game, after Kyle Rowe made a goal kick and failed the fifth attempt of manager Gregor Henry.
Still Game star looks ready to pursue her new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Kieran appears ready to move forward into the service industry after it was previously known that he was appointed as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis starred in the popular BBC show, which he directed and starred with his longtime comedian partner, Greg Hemphill.
The couple have already announced that the upcoming series to nine is the final episode, and it seems Kiernan is planning to lead the show immediately after Craiglang.
According to the official record list, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source indicated that Kiernan was trying to engage in a "growing restaurant business in Glasgow.
“The sea is ours: Bolivia, surrounded by land, hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific.
The sailors patrolled at the headquarters of the Laun forces located in La Paz.
The public building raised a blue sea flag.
The Navy base from Titicaca to Amazon was polished with a motto: "The sea is our legitimate right.
To be resurrected is an obligation.”
Passing through Bolivia surrounded by land, memories of the defeat of a coastline to Chile in a bloody 19th-century conflict remain clear – as a desire to once again cross the Pacific Ocean.
That hope is likely to reach its peak in a few decades, as Bolivia awaited a settlement from the court on October 1 after a five-year negotiation.
"Bolivia has a momentum, a spirit of unity and peace, and of course a positive hope for the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians who will watch the ICJ trial on widescreen across the country, hope that the court in The Hague will support Bolivia's claim that - after decades of that tense negotiation - Chile is obliged to negotiate a guarantee of Bolivia's sovereignty over the ocean.
Evo Morales, the charismatic Bolivian indigenous president—who faced a controversial war for next birthday election—has also had a lot of support at Monday’s trial.
“We are very close to the return of the Pacific Ocean,” he swore at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide on Bolivia’s wishes – and that it will only change a little if it is possible.
The Netherlands-based UN agency has no power to hand over Chile's territory, and has already stipulated that it will not decide on the outcome of possible negotiations.
The ICJ’s ruling came just six months after the final argument was heard, indicating the case was “not complex,” said Paz Zárate, an international lawyer in Chile.
And still far from continuing Bolivia’s demands, in the last four years may have been experiencing a retreat.
"The problem of access to the sea has already been hijacked by the Bolivian government now," he said.
The aggressive rhetoric of Morales has weakened the well-being of the remaining Chileans, he said.
Bolivia and Chile at some point will remain in negotiations, but it will be very difficult to remain in discussions after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltsé, the Bolivian government's deputy in The Hague quickly rejected the idea of decision-making.
On Monday, Bolivia will be "an extraordinary opportunity to open an era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreement with a shared benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales-still one of the most famous Latin American presidents-using maritime issues as a political supporter.
Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The conference is an opportunity to see what we need to complete in the past."
North Korea says a nuclear truce will not happen unless they can trust the U.S.
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his first country would never disarm nuclear weapons if Korea could not trust Washington.
Ri made a statement on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He mentioned that the United States was implementing the deal made at the time of a meeting in Singapore between competing leaders.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was seen almost beginning nuclear diplomacy that had been stalled for more than three months after a meeting with Kim Jong Un from North Korea.
Ri said it was only a "commute dream" that by continuing the U.S. sanctions and rejection of the Korean declaration of war resolution would make North Korea give up.
Washington has been careful to approve the declaration without Pyongyang making efforts to restrict the armed forces first.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold a second meeting.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is serious about the recognition of the arms warehouse that is for the country the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump
Paris fashion shows show a lot of the latest collections of head covers up to the main street near you
If you want to multiply the collection of hats or really want to be protected from sunlight do not look for the other.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne released a series of large-sized head covers for their SS19 collection on the fashion show stage with stunning style held at Paris Fashion Week.
The really impractical hats have been wiped out by Instagram this summer and these designers are already watching stunning creations on the public stage.
The highlight of Valentino is the creamy hat on which is decorated with a wide margin of fur that covers the model’s head.
Large-sized accessories include diamond-decorated crabs, witch hats and even a pineapple, but are not made to warm the head.
Thom Browne also showed a group of strange masks--and just before Halloween.
Many masks of different colors whose lips are already sewn and resemble Hannibal Lecter rather than haute couture.
A similar creation of scuba diving equipment is equipped with snorkels and glasses, while others look like melting ice cream.
And if you keep browsing the collection of the akbar fashion - then you are lucky.
Fashion observers estimate that the large collection of hats will be marketed to the main street near you.
The large-sized hats became a very popular trend in ‘La Bomba’, a straw hat with a two-legged outer edge is seen to be worn by everyone including Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The worship of the label behind the highly impractical hats of the creation of social media made a huge creation on the beach-tops of straw that is almost the same size as swimwear - worn with a slippery model.
The burned-out rafia bag, punched with rafia on the edges with a white handle strap, is a highlight of the Jacquemus' collection La Riviera SS19 at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity hairdresser Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I hope to see big hats and beach bags arrive on the main road for next summer - as the designers have already made a big impact, it will be difficult to ignore the demand for such large accessories."
John Edward: Language proficiency is very important for global citizens
The Scottish private school maintains a record track of academic excellence, and this was continued in 2018 with outstanding test results, which is increasingly reinforced by every student and collective success in sports, arts, music and hard work.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Board of Scottish Private Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the best service for students and parents.
The independent school aims to prepare its students for advanced and higher education, their career choices, and their role as world citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement school curriculum as expected, we see modern language continuing to be a popular and desirable subject of choice in many schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to someone in a language he understands, your speech will go into his head.
If you speak to him in his language then your speech will go into his heart.”
It’s a strong reminder that we can’t just rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s latest test results, we can see that the language is at the top of the league table with the highest ratings in the independent school.
A total of 68 percent of students who learn a foreign language get an A Plus rating.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools, showed that 72 percent of students get an A Plus rating in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learn German, 69 percent of those who learn French and 63 percent who learn Spanish also get an A rating.
This suggests that independent schools in Scotland support foreign language as an important skill that will certainly be needed by children and adolescents in the future.
Currently, languages, as a choice of subjects, are held in the same standard as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in modern school curricula and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Service in 2014 found that of some reasons employers should continue to struggle to fill vacancies, 17 percent of the reason is a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly encouraged to prepare teenagers for their future careers.
With more and more job opportunities requiring language skills, these skills are essential in the global world.
Whatever a person’s career choice, if they have already learned a second language, in the future they will feel real benefits because they have this kind of life-long skills.
Being able to communicate directly with residents of foreign countries will automatically make a multilingual superior in competition.
According to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 English adults in 2013, 75 percent of them did not speak a foreign language well enough to have conversations and French became the only language spoken in two digits percent, that is 15 percent.
This is why investing in language teaching for today’s children is important for the present.
Having multilingual skills, especially the languages of developing economies, will equip children with better opportunities to find meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, each school will teach a different language.
Some schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach the most important languages in the UK for the next few years, i.e. 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in the independent school, with teachers who are experts in the field.
The Scottish independent school aims to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills necessary to succeed, whatever happens in the future.
It is unthinkable that today, in a global business environment, language will always be an important aspect in determining the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern language must really be regarded as "international communication skills."
The independent school will continue to offer this choice, diversity, and excellence to Scottish teens.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Independent School Council.
LeBron will make his debut for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
Fans’ expectations of seeing LeBron James debut for the Los Angeles Lakers are almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening pre-season Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it has not been determined how many minutes he will play.
"It'll be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James was likely to play for a few minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers six pre-season games schedule.
"At the current stage of my career, I don't have to play a pre-season game to get ready," he said.
Trump's General Meeting Schedule in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump started a general meeting of the campaign tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This was Trump’s first general meeting of five general meetings scheduled for next week, including stops in some fun places that include Tennessee and Mississippi.
After it was confirmed that the vote was postponed so that he could vote for the Supreme Court’s office, Trump intended to build support for him for the upcoming half-time general election because the Republican Party was at risk of losing control of Congress if the vote was held in November.
What time is Trump’s general meeting in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's general meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled at 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s general meeting in West Virginia online through a live stream on YouTube.
Trump will likely discuss this week's trial for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who is increasingly tense after allegations of indecent sexual acts and an estimate of a Senate vote will be postponed for up to a week while the FBI is investigating it.
But the main objective of this general meeting agenda is to help the Republican party gain some momentum in the face of the November general election.
Therefore, in President Trump’s campaign it was mentioned that five general meetings in the coming week aim to “encourage volunteers and supporters as the Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and the DPR,” according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so important for its agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we face a busy campaign season," Trump's campaign spokesman said in a statement.
Scheduled for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the evening's general meeting is expected to bring backers from "Ohio and Pennsylvania as well as draw coverage from the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be Trump’s second visit to West Virginia in the last month, the state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a West Virginia Senate candidate from the Republican Party who is left behind in a poll.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come as an effort to increase his earnings in the poll,” Simon Haeder, a politician at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team bravery summit maintains its hopes in face of Sunday's single game
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon foursome sessions may be required in this Ryder Cup.
The momentum bandwidth is a concept of sport that is the result of a finding that is fully trusted by the players, and nothing is more than in competitions like this.
Where do you think the momentum is right now?
"Earlier, they were six points ahead and now four, so I think we're taking it as a little momentum," said Jordan Spieth as he passed the day.
Of course Europe has an advantage because it surpassed four points with twelve more games.
But the American team, as Spieth said, feels they have little momentum and they have a lot of things that can be passionate, not to mention the Spieth and Justin Thomas formations that play together throughout the day and each boast three out of four points.
Spieth has played lethally from the tee area to the green area and led with exemplaryness.
The ship's scream of celebration became louder as his turn arrived, making a putting blow important to make a series game as he and Thomas lost two opponents two.
A putting punch from him that won them at number 15 was greeted with a similar scream, a scream that told you that he was convinced America did not lose.
"You really have to work harder and worry about your own game," Spieth said.
All of these players are gone now.
18 holes to be marked.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas for two days yesterday were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable story of the Ryder Cup.
A unique but attractive couple from Europe is four to four and can do without mistakes.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who does not perform a bogey blow on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoid a bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
That’s the run, and how their energy seems to flow both to and from this crowd that convinces them that they are the players to be defeated on Sunday, and no player more famous than Fleetwood or Molinari will lock up the potential European victory at sunset over Le Golf National.
It is better if at the same time both are placed in a different hole.
However, it is still too early to talk about Europe’s victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson shortened the work of Sergio Garcia, the morning fourball hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on the front nine are like digging a hole that would never be climbed by these Spanish and Swedish golfers.
However, on Sundays nothing can help you get out of the hole.
Fourball and foursome are great shows to watch in more detail because of interactions between couples, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give and how the strategy can change instantly.
So far, Europe played better as a team and led far enough towards the final day, but the foursome session also showed that the U.S. team has a propensity to compete despite being questioned by some sides, especially in the United States.
Europe tops 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will take advantage of the profits in the Ryder Cup final day after rising from Saturday's fourball and foursome game with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The duo inspired Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two victories over Tiger Woods who had to struggle to record their points so far at Le Golf National with four points.
The European team Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to maintain the unprecedented trophy at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the wrong-bound American team in the morning fourball, making the series' results 3-1.
The United States gave more matches in the foursome, winning two games, but they could not reduce the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points out of 12 Sunday singles matches to defend the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European debut to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, were only the second pair to win four points from their four game openings in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourball they became very solid to defeat the knocking Woods and American debut Bryson Dechambeau with more firm 5&4.
Woods, who forced himself through two games on Saturday, occasionally performed brilliantly but has already lost 19 of 29 games in fourball and foursome as well as seven consecutive games.
Justin Rose, resting on the morning fourball, then returned to pair with Henrik Stenson in the foursome and lost 2&1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranks one and three worlds.
Europe does not achieve it on its own although the day is enjoyable and windy in the southwest of Paris.
The three-time major winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a draw for America by two points on Saturday.
They got an interesting 2&1 win over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the fourball then back again to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursome after losing the first two holes.
It only happened twice in the history of the Ryder Cup where a team returned from a four-point entry deficit to a single game, though as a defending champion the Furyk team only needed series points to maintain the trophy.
However, after being the second best for two days, Sunday's back attacks seemed to be going beyond them.
North Korea says it is 'impossible' to unilaterally disarm without trust
On Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister told the UN about sanctions that would continuously deepen its distrust of the United States and that it would not be possible for the country to unilaterally dispose of its nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Health Organization's annual General Assembly that North Korea has taken "significant measures showing good intentions" last year, such as halting nuclear tests and missiles, dismantling nuclear testing sites, and promising not to develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we don't see any appropriate response from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States there would be no confidence in our national security and in such a situation it would be impossible for us to unilaterally disarm our own weapons first."
While Ri reiterated the same complaint from North Korea about Washington's resistance to a "stupid" approach to denuclearization where North Korea would be punished for taking a gradual step, he made significant statements that they did not completely reject as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at a summit between the US presidential offices and the newly held North Korean leaders in Singapore on June 12, at which point Kim promised to pursue a "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised security to the United States.
North Korea has wanted an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said that Pyongyang should stop its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also rejected calls to ease heavy international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on "denuclearization first" and increases pressure by granting semi-sanctions to achieve their aims, and even rejects "the end-of-war declaration," Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can make us bend our knees is an illusion of people who don’t know about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions will deepen our disbelief.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump highlighted by the US leader at the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister even highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the problem in this denuclearization is South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula will not come up with such a downward path."
However, the tone of Ri’s speech was dramatically different from last year, when he spoke at the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korea’s rockets on the U.S. mainland was an unavoidable thing after Trump called Kim “a rocket human” on a suicide mission.
This year at a UN meeting, Trump last year threatened to “destroy” North Korea altogether, pouring compliments on Kim for his courage to take a step to resign, but the big work still needs to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time limit for this, "If it takes two years, three years or five months - no problem," he said.
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should punish Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The Security Council's sanctions must continue firmly and must not fail until we know that full, final and verified denuclearization."
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an effort to halt the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and said after that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July while saying that in fact there has been progress, only North Korea in a matter of hours that he made a "gangster-like demand."
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle the location of the missile and also the nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate action."
He stated that Kim ordered him to take "appropriate action" to his will is a security guarantee Trump promised in Singapore and moves towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take courses on sufficient breaks
A new course at Harvard University this year makes all S1 students there sleep more, in an effort to counter the macho culture in learning that is developing through caffeine-energy ‘human ghostbirds’.
An academic finds that students at the world’s number one university often don’t know anything if they discuss the very fundamental thing about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of medicine specializing in sleep problems at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the US.
He was inspired to start the course after giving lectures on the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
'At last a girl came to me and said, 'Why was I just being told now, in my last year?'
The girl said no one ever told me about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
The course, launched first this year, explains to students the essence of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic outcomes, as well as improving their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university’s executive director of health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after finding a student who was severely lacking sleep throughout the week.
This one-hour course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one session there is an overview of the bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports pants, and books to get an explanation about the influence of caffeine and lights, as well as how athletic results are influenced by lack of sleep, and the importance of sleep routines.
In the other section, participants get an explanation of how long a lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
"We know this won't change the student's behavior immediately.
But we are sure that they have the right to know – as you have the right to know the effects of choosing to smoke on health,” said Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of pride with ‘sleeping’ still exists, he argues, in addition that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students which means sleep deprivation is a constantly evolving problem.
Ensure that you sleep enough, with good quality, should be a ‘secret weapon’ to fight stress, fatigue, and anxiety – even to avoid weight gain, because lack of sleep makes the brain activate hunger mode, causing constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemistry and physical biology who helped Professor Czeisler design the course, had taken one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to organize courses for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes that all graduate students will be instructed to complete a similar study program before joining a competitive institution.
Prof Czeisler recommends that students should consider setting a sleep time alarm, as well as a wake-up alarm, and be aware of the effects of the ‘blue light’ emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can shift your circadian rhythm out of its tracks causing sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goals More mentally down Gerrard's team
Again, the Rangers felt the sadness of the day before when Dolly Menga's attack delivered Steven Gerrard's scoring team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team tried to record their first win in their journey, since the 4-1 win in February at St Johnstone, but the Gary Holt team had just given Gerrard a second defeat in 18 games as manager, causing his team to be eight points behind the Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts ranking leader.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the first round was over and the senseless Rangers players did not seem to balance.
While the Rangers are now down to sixth position, Livingston climbed up to third position, leaving only a goal difference from the Hibernian.
And there might be further problems in the Rangers castle after the Calum Spence line guard had to be treated because of a head wound after an object was thrown from a distance.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that crossed Ayr into the Betfred Cup semifinals.
On the contrary, Holt went with the same Livi 11 who took one point from Hearts last week and he would be happy with the stunning costume of their opponents at every opportunity.
The Rangers may dominate possession of the ball, but Livingston makes better use of the ball they have.
They were supposed to have scored in just two minutes when Menga's first short feed was thrown by Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor's goal, but the goalkeeper drew the big opportunity too wide.
Keaghan Jacobs's deep free kicks met captain Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only punch wide in the rear position.
The Rangers took control but apparently there was more hope than confidence about their game in the third final.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he was supposed to get a penalty when he and Steven Lawless collided on a quarter-hour mark but referee Steven Thomson rejected the appeal of this Colombian citizen.
The Rangers only managed to do two shots in the first half but previous Ibrox goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, almost never had a problem with Lassana Coulibaly's headshot and an easy-to-naked Ovie Ejaria attack.
Although Livi's opening goal in the 34th minute may be opposite to the course of the match, no one can deny that they deserve it because of their own hard work.
Once again, the Rangers failed to overcome Jacobs' deep dead ball tactics.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher placed the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm choosing Menga for a simple ending.
Gerrard acted during the break by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the exchange almost gave a direct effect as the wing player put the ball on Morelos but Kelly who played impressively quickly came out of the line to hit.
But Livingston continued to force the back team to play exactly the game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping all the long balls.
Holt's team were supposed to widen their lead in the final stage but McGregor stood well to kick Jacobs before Lithgow swung wide from the corner.
Rangers' substitute, Glenn Middleton, claimed the penalty again as he disputed with Jacobs, but again Thomson turned his face.
Almanac: The Inventor of Geiger's Inventor
And now from our Almanc page "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago on this day, and ONLY LOOKED BRITAMBHA... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, it was an invention that eventually made the device known as the Geiger Cutter.
Become a science legend since then, the Geiger Scout has also become a pop culture legend, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," starring the less convincing cow scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What's that?"
Rogers: "This is the Geiger Scrubber, used to find radioactive mineral locations, such as uranium.
When wearing this earphone, you can actually hear the effects of atoms released by radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: "Tell me, it must be coming up now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But that discovery keeps her name alive.
New Cancer Vaccine Teaches Immune System to ‘Recognize’ Bad Cells
New Cancer Vaccines Teach Immune Systems to 'Recognize' Malignant Cells and Kill They
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involves the process of extracting immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory.
They can then "recognize" proteins common to many cancers and then be injected again.
A test vaccine showed promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman is treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells, her ovarian cancer is lost for more than 18 months.
This method involves the patient's immune cell extraction process, changing it in the laboratory so that they can "recognize" the proteins that are commonly found in many cancers called HER2, and then re-inject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Agency in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "The results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "stimulates the growth of several types of cancer," including breast, ovaries, lungs, and colorectal cancers, Prof Berzofsky explains.
The same approach as taking patients' immune cells and "teaching" them how to target cancer cells has been successful in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West began the Pro-Trump Diatribe, wearing a MAGA Hat, after his SNL appearance.
It doesn't work well
Kanye West was mocked at the studio during Saturday Night Live after a messy performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After bringing the third song that night, titled Ghost Town where she wore a Make America Great hat, she challenged the Democratic party and repeated her support for Trump.
“I often talk to white people and they say, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s racist?’
Yes, if I’m concerned about racism, I’ve been out of America for a long time,” he said.
The SNL began the show with a screenplay starring Matt Damon where the Hollywood star laughed at Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee on sexual violence claims made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not aired, the West squirrel's footage was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock tried to mock West with the upload.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he was having trouble behind the scenes because of the hat he was wearing.
"They put me behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out wearing that hat."
They're catching me!
And then they say I’m drowning,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "You want to see the drowning place?" saying that he would wear Superman's dress, because this means you can't dictate what I should do. You want the world to go forward?
Try to love.”
His comments resulted in at least twice the discomfort of the SNL audience and the cast seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person telling: "The entire studio was silent."
West was brought in at the last moments as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, former girlfriend of rap singer Mac Miller who had just died a few days ago.
West confused many people with the appearance of his song I Love it, dressed like a Perrier Bottle.
West got the support of TPUSA conservative group leader Candace Turner who tweeted: "For one of the bravest souls: LOVE LOVE ONLY BUY RAKYAT."
But host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just "being herself and it was really very good."
“But I choose not to reward someone (by buying music or his clothes or supporting his ‘art’) that I believe embraces and highlights a dangerous ideology for my community.
He's free.
We too," he added.
Before the show, the rap singer announced on Twitter that she had changed her name, saying that she is now "a creature officially known as Kanye West."
He was not the first artist to change his name and follow the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Along with rap singer Snoop Dogg, Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion and of course named after Prince's music legend, turning his name into a symbol and then an artist formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington criticizes toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is famous for swinging the sword in his role as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series of HBO Game of Thrones.
But this actor, 31, nicknamed the stereotype of the macho hero, he said that roles on such screens made teenage boys often feel that they should be strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he was convinced 'there was something wrong' and questioned how to deal with the bad masculinity issues of the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who had just married his opponent in Game of Thrones Rose Leslie, also 31, said he felt "sufficiently strong" in discussing the issue.
“I feel personally, quite strong, right now – where are we wrong in terms of this masculinity?” he said.
'What do we teach men as they grow up, about the problems we see now?'
Kit believes television may be involved in the emergence of a bad masculinity with its highly masculine characters.
He continued: 'Who is a character from birth and what is he taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the street, that makes boys feel that they should have this particular side to be male?
I think that’s really one of the big questions at the moment – how do we change it?
Because there’s obviously something wrong with young people.”
In the interview he also admitted that he would not play in the prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones as the series will end next summer, saying that he was already 'finished with the battlefield and horse'.
Since November, Kit will star the return of True West from Sam Shepard, the story of the film producer and his brother, who was a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considered meeting with his wife Rose to be the best reason to get out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this show, thus giving me the future family, and from here my life began," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love flower of Kit character Jon Snow, in this Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie's homeland in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in its population living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are injured in the country, health officials said.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The majority of new cases are transmitted through sex, marking changes from previous ones.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly through parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has decreased to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year after year the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased to 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is becoming increasingly widespread.
Because of the country’s conservative value, the study estimates that 70-90% of men who have sexual intercourse with men will eventually marry women.
Many transmissions of the disease come from inadequate sexual protection in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV treatment as part of efforts to address the issue.
Maxine Waters denies that staff have leaked GOP senators' data, spreading "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theory"
Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denied that one of her staff members had sent personal information of three senators of the United States Republican Party to the Wikipedia page of parliamentary members.
The Los Angeles Democratic Party affirmed that the claim was driven by experts and the "ultra-right wing" website.
"Lies, lies, and many more ugly lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
It is reported that the information released included the home address and telephone numbers of U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee as well as Orrin Hatch, all from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, sent by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against potential Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the message was connected to the Waters office and revealed information from one of Waters staff members, Hill reported.
"These groundless accusations are completely wrong and are an absolute lie," Waters said.
"My staff members - whose identity, personal information, and safety are threatened by false and misleading allegations - are not responsible at all for the leaks of this information.
This unsubstantiated accusation is completely wrong and is an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly attracted online criticism, including from former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This obstacle means anger," Fleischer wrote.
"This shows that he is not fit to be a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of something that doesn’t do it, they shouldn’t be angry.
They can't deviate.
They can't question the defendant's motives.
They will be quiet and peaceful."
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of looking too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is trying to shift Waters to a part-time election, also voiced his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if it's true," he wrote on Twitter.
In his statement, Water said his office had warned "the correct authorities and law enforcement entities about these wrong allegations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be disclosed, and they will be legally liable for all their detrimental and dangerous actions to one and all of my staff members."
Review Johnny English Strikes Again - Rowan Atkinson's poor spy parody
Currently looking for the significance of Brexit in every new film with a British biased outlook has become a tradition and it seems to apply to the reappearance of Johnny English's parody franchise-comedy matches - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and relived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will the syndicate sarcasm of how clearly bad we are being a new export opportunity for this country?
Anyway, Johnny English, whose eyes are muscular, rubber-faced, and incompetent, has updated his license to mess up everything for the second time - his name gives more clues than anything else that he is a wide-ranging comic creation designed for a cinematic area other than English.
Of course he is a crazy secret agent who, despite his odd assumptions, has little Clouseau character, a sequel to Mr Bean character and a handful of travelers who contribute little notes to the theme Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
Indeed, he is based on the mysterious international traveler and man that Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV ad, leaving chaos behind.
There are one or two sweet moments in JE’s recent journey.
I liked when Johnny English approached the helicopter wearing a medieval zirah shirt and rotor bolts quickly attached to his helmet.
Atkinson's prize for physical comedy is featured, but his humor feels less energetic and too strange, especially when "serious" movie brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible have confidence to include the comedy as a material.
His humour feels like it's aimed at children rather than adults, and for me the strangely uninnovative Johnny English mischievousness and the focus of Atkinson's jokes on Bean's personality.
The premise that has been warming for years is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-attacker has entered a super-secret British spy web network, uncovering the identity of all British agents on the ground, to disappoint a tasked agent - unfortunately only a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This was the last chance for a proud and haughty prime minister, who had already destroyed her total political popularity: Emma Thompson played an excellent role with the quasi-Theresa-May character but did not have much to deal with from her script.
His smart counselor provides information that because every active spy has been weakened, he must bring one out of retirement.
And that meant Johnny English himself, now employed as the head of the school in some luxury buildings, but gave a secret lesson on how to perform a mask operation: there were some nice jokes here, when English offered academy spy like the School of Rock.
English was returned to Whitehall for emergency guidance and reunited with a long-suffering friend, Bough, played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now married, stricken by a submarine commander, the role of an asshole high-class woman where Vicki Pepperdine is a bit out of hand.
So Batman and Robin who make a mistake on His Majesty's Secret Agent return to action, meet the mysterious beautiful woman Ophelia Bulletova played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is worryingly falling under the influence of charismatic tech millionaire who claims to solve British computer problems: the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their ridiculous adventure: disguised as waiters, they burn up a fast-food French restaurant; they create chaos by smuggling themselves on a luxury ship belonging to Volta; and English triggers anarchy when he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's home.
All stops are certainly drawn for the last sequence, but with such hospitality and cravings, there are few children’s TV channels that contain about everything.
It's quite moderate.
And like other Johnny English movies, I can’t help thinking: couldn’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that’s really appropriate for his talent?
Workers are planning plans for British citizens to be able to work four days a week but paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn of the Labour Union considered a radical plan that wanted British citizens to work four days a week – but was paid for five days.
The union is reported to want company owners to continue savings through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution for workers by giving them additional holidays.
He will allow employees to enjoy the weekend three days – but still get the same pay.
Some sources say that the idea will "pass" with the party's economic agenda and plans to encourage the country to support workers.
The transition to four days a week has been approved by the UK Trade Congress as a way for workers to feel the benefits of economic change.
A source, a senior from the Labour Union, told The Sunday Times: "A review of this policy is expected to be announced before the end of this year.
"This will not happen overnight, but four working days a week is an aspiration that is in line with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy that supports the workers as well as the party's industrial strategy as a whole."
The Labour Party was not the first to support the idea, as the Green Party had already promised four days of work in a week on the 2017 general election campaign.
However, at the moment the aspirations are not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'Four working days a week is not a party policy and is not being considered by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to perfect his vision for the socialist revolution in the field of economics.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from ‘anonymous directors’ and ‘cautists’ at utility companies.
The shadow Chancellor’s plan also means that current shareholders in the drinking water company may not be able to regain their entire shares because the Labour government can make a ‘reduction’ on perceived grounds of violation.
He also secured his plans to place employees on the company’s board and created an Inclusive Ownership Fund that would provide 10 percent of the company’s private sector equity to employees, which would raise annual dividends up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their views
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination in the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raises questions as to whether the office's findings could influence Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, whether the FBI could find something that could make them change their mind.
Kennedy seems to be more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
“I said I would attend the trial, I said, I’ve talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this incident, the charges appeared, and said, ‘You did it?’
He's a strong, strong, strong man."
However, it seems that Graham’s voice will not be changed.
"My mind has made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh, and it needs bigger charges to change it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what's going on, but all I know is: Brett strongly opposes it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone he mentioned his name can't verify it.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is meant by the Global Citizen Festival and has this event done something to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York will hold the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring a series of stars performing with great impressive, and also an effective mission; ending poverty in the world.
Now, in the seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will be witnessing tens of thousands of people coming to the Great Lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy the action of Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event’s real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting poverty.
In order to get free tickets for the event (unless you want to pay for VIP tickets), concert visitors must complete a series of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, sending emails to world leaders, calling, or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen over the past 12 years been in achieving its goal?
Is the idea of giving a free concert gift the right way to invite people to take an action, or is it just another case called "clickivism" - people feel like they're making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, pushing to set other goals.
It is said that this action has helped drive world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than <0x24>37 billion that will affect more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group had collected 390 commitments and announcements derived from their actions, at least <0x24>10 billion of which had been spent or fundraised.
The group estimates that safe funds so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and executives committed to "helping children grow to their full potential," promising to give Rwanda <0x24>35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Cizen.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can make social injustice about this malnutrition a milestone in history,” The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told a crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to improve nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funds for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children through nutrition.
Responding to one of the questions in the General Answer Question on their website asking "what makes you think we can end this extreme poverty?"
Global citizens responded: "This will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
However, just like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements that existed before us, we will succeed, because if we unite we will become stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe were some of the stars appearing at this year's show in New York, which would be led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use the Navy as a "block" to curb Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
"If necessary" Washington could ask for Naval assistance to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, US Secretary of State Ryan Zinke said, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke strongly suspects that Russia’s involvement in Syria – in particular, where it operates at a legitimate government invitation – is a pretext for exploring a new energy market.
"I'm sure the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to be energy brokers, just like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to prevent it.
“The United States has that ability, with our Navy, to ensure open sea lines, and, if necessary, to carry out blockades, to ensure that their energy cannot enter the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke in front of the participants of the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself a "energy customer voice" in the US.
He compared Washington’s approach in the deal with Russia and Iran, seeing that in terms of effectiveness, they are the same.
"The economic options in Iran and Russia are less or more, exploiting and replacing fuels," he said, referring to Russia as one of the "experts in the field" with an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
The statement comes as representatives of the Trump administration are on a mission to increase their exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper option for customers in Europe.
For that, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 oil pipeline project, which Trump said made Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the <0x24>11 billion Nord Stream 2 oil mill project, designed to double the capacity of the existing oil pipeline up to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin denies that Washington’s fierce resistance to the project is solely driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I am confident that we have the same view that energy cannot be made a tool to put pressure and that customers should be able to choose their own suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
This US attitude has drawn a reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed their commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the US not to interfere in the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I will face a big problem if a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Will “Watch the Situation” While Nominating as President in 2020, Massachusetts Senator Says
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said that she would "observe the situation" while running for president after a half-time election.
While campaigning at the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren insisted he would consider applying.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, including putting women in the top position," she told The Hill.
“After November 6, I will look at the situation as I run for president.”
Warren compared himself to President Donald Trump while campaigning in the city hall, saying that he "leads this region in the wrong direction.
“I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren blasted in expressing his criticism of Trump and potential Supreme Court leader Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before making a vote."
However, an opinion poll released on Thursday, suggesting that most of Warren’s constituents themselves did not want him to run for office in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' "probability" voters said Senators should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-three percent supported the nomination.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick to run, with 38 percent in favor of the possibility of running and 48 percent against him.
Other key names in the Democratic Party discussed regarding the possibility of running in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide it in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin Quotes on PTSD Track Palin During Donald Trump Campaign
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after entering the army in September.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
"What my son is experiencing, what he will experience when he returns, I can connect with other families who also feel the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers have suffered," he said in front of the attendees of the campaign for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to his arrest as "the elephant in the room" and told of his son and other war veterans, "they returned with a little bit differently, they returned with more force, they returned and wondered if there was any respect for what they had given, fellow soldiers and aviators and any other military member to the country."
She was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, plus reports of domestic violence and gun ownership in a drunk state, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supports challenges to new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support legal challenges to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum for victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and districts filed a friend-of-the-court brief on Friday in Washington to support asylum seekers challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff Grace v. In a session lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
He said his colleague "and his son who was a cruel gang member," had harassed him, but U.S. officials rejected his asylum application on July 20.
He was detained in Texas.
The state prosecutor who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produced large numbers of asylum seekers for the United States, as a country facing major problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed the 2014 Immigrant Board of Appeal decision allowing dark immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignored the state, federal, and international laws that have existed for decades."
"Federal law requires that all asylum claims should be decided on the basis of certain facts and circumstances relating to the claim, and such a prohibition violates the principle," he said briefly.
Further prosecutors gave a brief opinion that policies that denied immigration were detrimental to the U.S. economy, saying that they would most likely be employers and "supply the necessary workforce."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in June, ordered the immigration judge to no longer provide asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"Suaka is available to those who leave their country of origin due to persecution or fears caused by issues of race, religion, nationality, or membership in certain social groups, or political opinions," Sessions said in a statement of this policy on June 11.
Suaka is not meant to alleviate all the problems — although all the problems are serious — that people face every day around the world.
Extremely sad rescue efforts in Palu as the victim doubles as he races with time to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is getting worse.
"It feels very stressful," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, reassuring her demented boy in a refugee centre in the devastated city of Palu.
Every minute the ambulance comes to bring the corpses.
“Clean water is very rare.”
Citizens are seen returning to their destroyed homes, taking things underwater, trying to save whatever they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitalized, the damage caused by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, was very chaotic.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a fracture of the spine and shoulder, lie outside the Palu Army Hospital, where the patient was treated outdoors due to a strong follow-up earthquake.
His tears flowed as he recounted his feelings as the quake shook his five-storey hotel room staying with his wife and daughter.
“You can’t save yourself.
I think I'm stuck in the ruins of the wall," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in the city to attend the wedding.
“I heard my wife cry for help, then shut up.
I don’t know the situation and my son.
May they be safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of ‘intimidating’ with ‘propaganda advertising’
A week after the official Chinese newspaper loaded a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper that referred to the mutual gains behind U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China's paid supplement Daily on the Des Moines Register - the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. congressional election on Nov. 6, an allegation contested by China.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US election, which marks what US officials say to Reuters, is a new phase in Washington’s increased campaign to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently interfering in an ever-increasing trade war, which causes them to raise each other’s import tariffs.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war are designed to strike exporters in states like Iowa that support the Trump Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed workers, farmers, and businessmen in America.
China, Branstad wrote an opinion in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "now doubling the intimidation by running propaganda ads in our own free media."
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government has taken advantage of the tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of the press that is highly valued in America by loading paid advertisements on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
"Instead, in the kiosks of street newspaper sellers here, in Beijing, you will find restrictions on different voices and you will not see the actual reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese may have about the troubled Chinese economic trajectory, given that the media is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party."
He added that "one of the most prominent media in China rejected an offer to publish" his article, although he did not mention which newspaper.
Analysts Warn Republican Party Keeps Women Voters Ahead of Half-Time Elections With Kavanaugh Disaster
As important people in the Republican Party standing up and defending candidate Supreme Court leader Brett Kavanaugh in the face of some allegations of sexual violence, analysts have warned that they will see a backlash, especially from women, in the upcoming mid-term general election.
Emotions over the issue were very high, and most members of the Republican Party recorded already showed that they wanted to move forward on the vote.
That can't be prevented," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School, Syracuse University, told The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator (R-Arizona) Jeff Flake's push to the last minute to conduct an FBI investigation would be enough to ease the anger on voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow, nor will they forget it in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the MoveOn progressive group, said on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted "November is near!" as they held demonstrations in the hallways of the Senate as the Republican Party controlled the Judiciary Committee to keep moving forward in Kavanaugh's nomination regardless of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"Enthusiasm and democracy motivation will come out of the list," non-party political analyst Stu Rothenberg told the news site.
“People say it’s high enough; and it’s true.
But it could be even higher, especially among women voters in suburbs and younger voters, ages 18 to 29, who because they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony detailing the sexual harassment of him by the Supreme Court’s prospective leader, analysts advised that there would be a subsequent backlash if the Republican Party kept pushing him forward with confirmation.
"This has become a mess for the GOP," Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
"It's not just about the committee election or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be placed on the bench, it's also about how the Republicans handle this issue and how they treat it," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helped to vote for the Democratic Party, pointed to the news channel.
However, Americans would seem to be divided about who to trust after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slightly more favourable choice to the latter.
A new poll conducted by YouGov showed that 41 percent of respondents actually believed or might believe in Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they really believed or might believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they felt Kavanaugh was lying during his testimony, while only 30 percent said something similar about Ford.
After a push from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the charges filed by Ford and one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that the drunk Kavanaugh had attacked him when he was 17.
Ramirez said the Supreme Court’s candidates showed him his great-grandparents as they attended a party while they were studying in Yale in the 1980s.
Inventor of the World Wide Web Plans to Start a New Internet to Face Google and Facebook
Team Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launched a startup that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company built from the open source platform Berners-Lee, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and anyone allowed to have access to any information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, while joking Berners-Lee said that the meaning behind Inrupt was "the world domination."
“We have to start it now,” he said from the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own "personal online data storage" or POD.
This storage may contain contact lists, task lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify which are all available in one browser and all at the same time.
The unique thing about this personal online data storage is that it really depends on the user who can access what kind of information.
In the company it is known as "personal empowerment through data."
The idea to establish Inrupt, according to company CEO John Bruce, is for the company to present the right resources, processes, and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several staff developers hired to work on the project, and a community of code-makers volunteers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralization applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team did not talk to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a total change in which all their business models will be completely reversed in the past night.
“We didn’t ask for their permission.”
In a post in Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide energy and commercial ecosystems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet as he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has become an influential voice in network debate neutrality.
Even when launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation, and Open Data Institute.
“I’m very optimistic about the next web era,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann to commemorate WW1 Victoria Cross
The only Church scholar in England to win the Victoria Cross during the First World War as a warrior, remembered in his birthplace 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel The Reverend, Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 for the attacks at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew that he had won the highest British military honour.
A memorial stone was inaugurated by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was a “smart symbol” that would reveal exactly 100 years of his grandfather’s award-winning achievement.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "a very thick fog pervaded under the string of fire from field weapons and machinery."
He then hurried forward to the battle line and with "best courage" led the front line before rushing to use field weapons alone and disable three detachments.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I knew I would not be able to live but it was a very humble act.”
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid the flower bouquet after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very proud to be involved in this parade" and added "the courage of a true hero is being shown with the support that many will give."
MMA fans spend the night watching Bellator 206, but they even get Peppa Pig
Imagine this, you’ve spent the night watching a busy Bellator 206 just to be refused to watch the main show.
The bill from San Jose contains 13 fights, including six on the main card and is being broadcast live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, the audience in the UK was made clumsy when its cover turned to Peppa Pig.
Some people feel unappreciated after they are premature until a special day for the fight.
A fan on Twitter described the switch to children’s cartoon movies as “annoying joke.”
"It is a government regulation, that at 6 a.m. the content is not suitable for broadcasting, so it is replaced with children's program," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa is a pig, yes."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said that they will improve their schedule by taking into account audiences in the UK in the future.
"In my opinion, if we think about replaying, I think we might be able to finish it," Coker said.
"But now there are six in the morning on Sunday and we will not be able to fix it until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, at the time of change, there are so many texts back and forth and everything is not educating.
We're trying to fix it, we think it's just a technical error.
No, it's a matter of government.
Trust me, next time it won’t happen again.
We're going to reduce up to five fights out of six fights - as we usually do - and we're going to try to avoid over-exposure for fans, and we succeed.
This is an unfavorable situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'self-conscious' about sexuality issues
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he grew up with low self-esteem due to his sexuality issues – but that gave him motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize it until he entered high school, that “not everyone is like me.”
Speaking for the first time on Radio 4 Desert Island Discs brought by Lauren Laverne, she said, she spoke about the rights of gays to give "hope" to others.
He also said being a parent made him not so much interested in winning the Olympics.
The usual host of this long-running event, Kirsty Young, is taking a few months off due to illness.
Appearing as the people eliminated on Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less than" all the others who grew up with him because "it's not socially acceptable to like men and women."
“Until today, those feelings are less than the others, and different feelings have become real things that give me the strength and strength to succeed.”
She wanted to prove that she was "something," she said, so she wouldn't disappoint everyone when they found out about her sexuality issue.
The Olympic bronze medalist has become a well-known LGBT campaigner and uses his appearances at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to attract more countries to not discriminate against homosexuals.
She said she spoke because she felt lucky to be able to live with openness without consequences and wanted to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said he fell in love with a man - US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "surprised me."
Daley married an Oscar winner who was 20 years older than her last year, and said age gaps were not a problem.
“When you have so many problems at a very young age” — he attended his first Olympics at age 14 and his father died of cancer three years later — he said it was very difficult to find someone of the same age who experienced the same slippery slope.
The couple had become parents in June, with a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said "his whole perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, it's all about 'I have to win the gold medal'," he said.
“You know, there’s something bigger than just winning the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son had the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father could not accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was whether they already got tickets for the 2012 London Olympics - because he wanted to sit on the front row.
"I can't tell him 'You're not going to sit on the front row of your father'," he said.
“I held his hand as he stopped breathing and still didn’t really stop breathing until he died, I finally admitted that he was invincible,” he said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"All I know is, this is what I've dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of the crowd at the Olympic Games, there's no feeling better than that," he said.
It also inspired her first song selection – Proud by Heather Small – which had already merged with her in her preparations for the Olympics and still made her cringe.
Desert Island Discs is a BBC Radio 4 broadcast on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Mickelson changed role when proposed at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American golfer Phil Mickelson will record on Sunday as he plays the 47th Ryder Cup match, but he has to change roles to avoid unpleasant achievements.
Mickelson, who played in a two-year event to record the 12th time, was suggested by captain Jim Furyk for a four-ball and four-group game on Saturday.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as he usually did for the United States, this top five-time winner splits his time between being a cheerleader and playing his game on the range, hoping to fix what has bothered him.
Never been the most straightforward golfer despite being at the top of his career, this 48-year-old man is not fit to take a very strict course at Le Golf National, which routinely gives a long and rough penalty for every wrong shot.
And for his own pitch, it’s not scary enough for Mickelson, in his ninth game on Sunday, faced very accurate English Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has worked with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all of their four games this week.
If this American golfer, starting 12 single games with four points below, starts with a hot start, then Mickelson's match proved to be very important.
Furyk expressed faith in this man, not because he could say many other things.
"He really understood his role today, kicked my back and embraced me, and said he was going to be ready for the game tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He's so confident.
He was the Hall of Famer and he gave so much to this team in the past, and this week.
Maybe I can’t imagine he’s playing two games.
I imagined the others, but that’s how he plays and that’s the way we think we should go.
He wants to enjoy a different atmosphere, just like most people.”
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for the most played Ryder Cup match, on Sunday.
This could mark the end of his career in the Ryder Cup which would never match the height of his individual record.
Mickelson scored 18 wins, 20 losses and seven times in a row, although Furyk said his presence brought some unspeakable things to the team.
"He's funny, he's sharp, he's funny, he likes to joke people, and he's a cool guy in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players are having fun with him, too, this week, which is quite fun to see.
He gives a lot of things, more than just playing.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows great advantages could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, learned from the experience that someone who led big enough towards his last single game in the Ryder Cup could easily be an unpleasant trip.
Dane made his first debut at the 1997 game in Valderrama, with team captain Seve Ballesteros holding a five-point lead over America, but just touching the finish line with their nose with the thinnest margin, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we get a great lead in Valderrama; we get a great lead in Brookline, where we lose, and in Valderrama, where we just won, but just now," said Bjorn, taking a picture, after watching Class of 2018, winning 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday by leading 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So, history will show me and everyone in the team that this is not over.
Tomorrow you will enter a really boring game.
Go out and do all the right things.
It’s not over until you get points on the board.
We have a goal, and that goal is to win this trophy, and that’s the focus.
I’ve been saying for a long time, I’m focused on the 12 players on our side, but we’re also very aware of what’s on the other side – the greatest players in the world.”
Glad to see the players playing on the hard golf course, Bjorn added: "In this case I will never progress on my own.
Tomorrow is a different star.
Tomorrow, individual players will advance, and this is a different thing that will be done.
It’s great to be out there with a colleague when everything goes well, but if you’re out there playing individually, then your abilities as a golfer will be tested.
That’s the message you should tell all the players, getting the best out of you for tomorrow’s game.
Now, you leave your colleague and he has to go to get the best out of him."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk would ask his players to play individually better than they did as a joker, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself had been at both ends of the final day's round of the big game, having been part of the team that won at Brookline before ending with a defeat as Europe did "Wonders in Medina."
"I remember every word," he said, answering questions about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, brought his players together towards the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start it as fast as you see in Brookline, as you see in Medina.
When the momentum runs one way, it will put a lot of pressure on the midfielder.
We also set up a player list and put people in a variety of ways that we think, you know, we’re trying to do miracles tomorrow.”
Thomas has been assigned to try to lead the match against Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, the other European players being in the top.
"I went with this group of people in this order because I think I can close all the way," Bjorn said of his only choice.
Germany's new warship suspended
The newest German naval watchdog should have begun to serve in 2014 to replace the old Cold War warship, but the ship will not be there until at least next year due to the wrong system and its rising costs, local media reported.
The assignment of "Rheinland-Pfalz," the main ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class watchdog, has now been suspended until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to have joined the Navy in 2014, but post-delivery problems have disrupted the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class guard ship.
The ship will be equipped with powerful cannons, a series of anti-aircraft missiles, and anti-ship missiles, as well as some scam technologies, such as radar removers, infrareds, and acoustic locks.
Other important features include a longer period of care – it should be possible to use the newest guard ship for two years away from its original port.
However, the continuous delay meant this sophisticated warship - which is said to allow Germany to highlight its power overseas - would be outdated by the time it began entering its tenure, Die Zeit noted.
The unlucky F125 was reported last year, when the German Navy officially refused to assign the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the shipbuilder after the shipment.
Only a few reasons are known behind the ship's return, but German media cited a number of "software and hardware defects" that made the warship useless if used for combat missions.
Software defects were crucial because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ship would be operated by a crew of 120 sailors - only half of the workforce on the older Bremen-class warship.
It was also known that the ship's weight was excessive which would reduce its performance and limit the Navy's ability to add future updates.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz" weighing 7,000 tons is believed to be twice as heavy as ships of a similar class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the damaged hardware, the cost of production of the entire project - including the training of the crew of the ship - also became a problem.
It is said to have risen surprisingly to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0x24>3.6 billion) – up from the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problem that hits the most recent watchdog ships became very important given the latest warnings as there was a shrinkage in the German naval force.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliamentary defense committee admitted that the Navy was actually "depleted of ships with the ability to spread."
The official said as the problem grew, as the old ships were no longer in use but no replacement ships were provided.
He regretted that not one of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class guard ships could join the Navy.
The National Trust listens to the secret life of mosquitoes in secret
New research has been done on a plantation in the Scottish Highlands that aims to uncover how bats use natural landscapes in their food hunting.
It is expected that these findings will give new light on this unique flying mammal behavior and help guide conservation activities in the future.
The study, conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common pipstrelle and soprano as well as long-eared chocolate moss and Daubenton at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at the main location around the property to track mosaic activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct cellular surveys using handheld detectors.
The sound specialist who analyzes all the recordings will ensure the frequency of the call of the mosquitoes and the species which perform what activity.
Then maps and habitat reports will be made to create images with a detailed landscape scale of nature about their behavior.
Rob Dewar, natural conservation adviser for NTS, hopes these results will reveal which habitat areas are most important to mosquitoes and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management jobs such as meadow farming and the best way to maintain forests for moss and other related species.
The population of mosquitoes in Scotland and throughout the UK has declined sharply in recent centuries.
This turtle is threatened by the existence of development and development work that affects the nest and the loss of habitat.
Wind and lighting turbines also pose risks, such as sticky paper hanging to crawl mosquitoes as well as chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks from pet cats.
In fact, the mosquitoes are not blind.
However, due to his hunting habit at night, his ears are more useful than his eyes in terms of catching the prey.
They use sophisticated genome location techniques to find insects accurately and barriers in their flight paths.
NTS, which is responsible for caring for over 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks, and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is very concerned with mosquitoes.
Have ten trained experts, who routinely do surveys, nest inspections, and sometimes rescue efforts.
The organization has also established the first and only natural reserve in Scotland on the Threave plantations in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight out of ten species of mosquitoes in Scotland.
Plant manager David Thompson said the plantation was a suitable area for moss.
"Here at Threave, we have a great area for mosquitoes," he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees, and all good habitats.
However, there’s still a lot we don’t know about mosquitoes, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us understand more about what they need to grow.”
He stressed the importance of checking mosquitoes before doing maintenance inside the property, as unconsciously there is a possibility of the destruction of one prenatal nest could kill up to 400 female and minor mosquitoes, which would probably destroy the entire local population.
Cows are protected and killing, harassing, or disturbing, or destroying their nests is an illegal act.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scotland's official for the Conservation of Wheat Trust, has encouraged the general public to join in helping.
He said: "We still have a lot to learn about our mosquitoes and for many of our species that we don't yet know how their populations are going to be."
Ronaldo, who denies rape claims, is preparing a lawyer to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape claim to himself "fake news," and said that people "will promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyer would demand the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus attackers are accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He later allegedly paid him <0x24>375,000 to keep his mouth shut about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in Instagram's live video to its 142 million followers hours after the claim was reported, Ronaldo, 33, denounced the report as "fake news."
"No, no, no, no.
What they say today is fake news," the Ballon d'Or winner said five times to the camera.
“They want to promote themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They wanted to be famous by mentioning my name, but it was part of the job.
I'm a happy guy and everything's fine," the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel on the charges, which they call "an unacceptable report of suspicion in the field of privacy," according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said he would seek compensation as "moral compensation in proportion to the severity of the violation, which may be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a suite room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga were reported back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her, according to reports filed at Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga said Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told him that "99 percent" he was a "good man" who disappointed only "one percent."
The document says that Ronaldo justified that they both had sex, but it was on the basis of a joint desire.
Mayorga also said she went to the police station and had made a visa for her injuries in the hospital, but then agreed to solve the problem outside the court because she felt she was "fearing to get revenge" and worried "would be embarrassed in public."
The 34-year-old said she was now trying to cancel the peace deal because she was continuously traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo almost joined Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time the attack was charged, and this summer he moved to Italian giant club Juve with a deal of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: Britain 'will be forever sorry' for the loss of car manufacturers
Britain "will regret forever" if it loses its status as a world leader as a car manufacturer after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added "about" Toyota, the UK has told the BBC that if the UK leaves the European Union without a deal, it will temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of the border delay if there is no deal would be detrimental to Brexit in terms of labor costs.
The plant in Burnaston - which makes Auris and Avensis produce Toyota - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, with 90% exported to all over the European Union.
"My opinion is that if the UK leaves the European Union by the end of March, we will see a halt to production at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's executive director at Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have expressed concerns about their exit from the European Union without an agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close its Mini factory in Oxford a few months after Brexit.
The main problem associated with what the car makers say is the risk of the supply chain if there is no deal with Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is run on the “timely” production principle, with spare parts entering every 37 minutes both from suppliers in the UK and the European Union for cars made according to orders.
If Britain leaves the European Union without a deal on March 29, there may be a breakdown at the border, which the industry says could lead to delays and lack of spare parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store supplies for more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and thus production would be stopped.
Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the European Union was "adequately calibrated to avoid checks at the borders."
"We need to have a deal. We want to get the best deal that will also allow what I'm saying not only to enjoy success at the moment, but for us to get this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4.
“The evidence is not only from Toyota alone but from other manufacturers as well, that we really should be able to continue what has already been a supply chain that has been running very well.”
Toyota cannot say how long its production will be halted, but it is clear in the long run, warning that the addition of costs will reduce the competitiveness of the factory and will ultimately be detrimental in terms of labor costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is the manager of Unite workers' unions at the factory, says his members are already increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once this job is gone, it will never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have presented the right and reasonable plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, the White House says
Donald Trump’s high-risk meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed back another week” as the fight for Supreme Court chief Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the general election, ties between Trump’s and Russian aides, as well as potential obstructing justice by the president.
Whether Trump will fire the Deputy Prosecutor General or not, which will jeopardize Mueller’s freedom, has sparked rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing using telegrams to record conversations with Trump and possibly overthrowing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, amid reports that he was going to resign.
On the contrary, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN office in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would "choose not" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was again postponed to avoid clashes with the Senate judiciary committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both would testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation for a week over claims against Kavanaugh, which subsequently delayed the Senate's full vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The date for the meeting has not been set, it could be this week, I can see that it's good to back it up to another week also given the other things that happened in the Supreme Court.
But we just look at it and I always want to bring the latest news to the press."
Several journalists will oppose the statement: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
The host of the show, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said the rare meeting was not because of the feeling of dislike of TV journalists "who were trying to attract attention," although, he said, "I disagree with the fact that they were trying to attract attention."
He then proposed that direct contact between Trump and the press be enhanced.
"The president has done more interviews directly than the previous president," he said, adding without mentioning the evidence: "We've already seen those figures."
The meeting will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions to the president of the United States directly, it's far better than talking to me.
We’ve been trying to do it more often and you’ve seen us do a lot in the last few weeks and that will replace the press conference if you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump routinely asked questions when he left the White House or participated in an open session or press conference with visiting senior officials.
A solo press conference is rare.
This week in New York, the president will probably show his reasons, perform a free and sometimes strange performance before the journalists meet.
Health Secretary writes letter to EU workers at the Scottish NHS on concerns about Brexit issues
The health secretary has written a letter to EU staff working at the Scottish NHS to express gratitude to the country and hope they will still work here after the Brexit issue.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter in less than six months until Britain withdrew from the European Union.
The Scottish government has committed to meet the costs of applying for permanent status for EU citizens working in the public service being transferred.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between Britain and the European Union on this withdrawal are still ongoing, approaching the expected decision in the fall.
But the British government has also been prepared for the possible scenario of no deal.
I know this must be very disturbing to all of you.
That’s why I now want to reaffirm how much I value the contributions of every staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the European Union, and others, bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve health care work, and benefit patients and communities we serve.
Scotland really is your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers rear midfielder Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury on a 31-27 defeat to Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Mike Organ of Tennessee reported.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury happened shortly before the round ended.
"He came to the edge of the field and fell out there," Reed said.
Coaches and medical forces gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the field before putting it on the stove and carrying it for further evaluation.
An official from the state of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had already left the operating room at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details about the type/level of injury experienced" and the State of Tennessee is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, this red-haired two-tier student, was in his first season with the State of Tennessee after being transferred from Illinois.
He got a total of five ties on Saturday before leaving the game, which made his total tie during this season to 18 ties.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher mattress fee when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher mattress fee when they buy property in the UK, as well as additional money that will be used to help homeless according to the new Tory plan.
This move will stop the success of Corbyn's movement in attracting young voters.
Increased taxes will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Finance Department estimates it will raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher mattress fee when they buy properties in the UK – along with additional money that will be used to help homeless people, Theresa May will announce it today.
This move will be seen as an effort to deter Jeremy Corbyn’s success rate in attracting young voters with the promise of providing more affordable housing and targeting high incomes.
Increases in mattress costs will be imposed on individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK, as well as additional money that encourages the government's efforts to fight the loophole.
The additional cost – which is an additional cost on the current mattress cost, including the higher level introduced two years ago on the purchase of a second home and the purchase of a house for rent – could reach three percent.
The Department of Finance expects this move to rise to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of London’s newly built properties were bought by non-English residents, which led to price rises and made it increasingly difficult for the first buyer to step on the housing staircase.
Many rich areas in the country - usually in the capital - have become a "ghost city" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy came out just a week after Boris Johnson called for a cut in mattress costs to help more young people have their first home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping property prices high by buying land but not using it, and urged Ms May to ignore quotas for affordable homes to fix "unobtainable housing" in the UK.
Corbyn has announced a series of reform proposals in the field of attractive housing, including oversight of rents and ending the "no guilt".
He also wanted to give the council greater power to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year I promised I would dedicate the prime minister’s office to restoring Britain’s dream – that life should be better for every generation.
And that means repairing our broken housing market.
The UK will always be open to those who want to live, work, and build life here.
However, it is not appropriate for individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as companies based overseas, to buy a home as easily as a hard-working British citizen.
For many people the dream of having a home becomes something very far away, and the unkind treatment of the innate remains real."
Jack Ross: 'My main ambition is to lead Scotland'
Sunderland's boss, Jack Ross said "his main ambition" was to be Scotland's manager at some stages.
This 42-year-old Scottish player, enjoying the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which currently ranks third in the League One, three points apart from the top position.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I want to support my country as a player.
I got a B hat and that's him," Ross told Sportsound, the Scottish BBC.
"But I grew up and often watched the Scottish team in Hampden with my father as a child, and it has always been something that attracts me to come back.
However, that opportunity will come, if I succeed in the management of the team."
Sunderland managers before Ross included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
This former Alloa Athletic boss said he was not afraid to follow the footsteps of such big names at the club, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, the current success will be measured by 'Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?'
Due to the structure and facilities at the club, there is no doubt to be in the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not an easy task to be there, but I’ll probably only see myself as a successful person here, if I can bring this club back there.”
Ross's career in team management was only three years, after some time as assistant boss at Dumbarton, and spent 15 months as coach staff at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from degradation to third position, and turned St Mirren from the degradation gap into the championship title winner the following season.
And Ross said he now feels more comfortable than he ever did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academic.
"This may be the road crossing I have to go through," she recalled as she took over Alloa.
"I'm really sure management is the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds strange because I’m fine, I’m looking for spending in a reasonable way, and enjoying some reasonable things.
But playing can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I still experience it in terms of work pressure, but in management it feels fine.
I've always wanted to lead something and now I do it, the most comfortable feeling I've ever felt in my adult life."

The summer heatwave has increased the income of pubs in the UK who are struggling to survive, but more pressure on restaurant networks.
The figures show that pub and bar groups saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July – but revenues in restaurants fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, CGA's business consultant, who compiled the figures, said: "The bright sun and England's participation in the longer-than-expected World Cup will follow the same pattern as in June, where pub revenues increased by 2.8 percent, except for restaurants that get hard hits.
The decline in restaurant trade of 1.8 percent in June will worsen in July.
Sales of pub and bars that have sold drinks so far have been strongest compared to those that happened in downstairs restaurants.
The pub that sells food also suffers from the heat of the sun, although not separate restaurant operators.
It looks like people just go out for a drink.
Sales across pubs and managed bars that sell beverages rose 6.6 percent this month, with food sales down three percent.
Paul Newman, RSM’s recreational and hospitality analyst, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since April.
The weather and impact of large social events or sports remain the biggest factor in sales of markets outside the home.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle to survive, although a 4.8 percent drop in sales from year to year would be very painful over the ongoing cost pressure.
A long summer shouldn’t come at a time when the operators selling food are experiencing bad weather, and time will tell if the good enough temperatures we’ve already enjoyed in August will give us a bit of the rest we need.”
Total sales growth across pubs and restaurants, including the newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, indicating a slowdown on brand launch.
The industry sales survey of the Coffer Peach Tracker for the pub, bar, and restaurant sectors in the UK collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and is an industry benchmark that can no longer be ignored.
One in five children has a secret social media account they hide from their parents.
The survey revealed that one in five children — some of them are still 11 years old — have secret social media accounts they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students reveals the development of a "fake Insta" page
The news has raised concerns about the posting of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students say they have a "first" account to show to parents
One in five children — some of them are still 11 years old — create social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapid development of a “fake Insta” account – a reference to a photo-sharing site on Instagram.
The news has raised concerns about the posting of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students say they operate a “primary” account that has already been cleared to show to parents, while also having a private account.
A mother who finds her 13-year-old daughter's secret site finds a teenager who asks others for "my rape."
Research conducted by the British Digital Awareness and the Conference of the Chief School Men" and the Chief School Women" (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, with half of them claiming to keep a private account.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: “This is disturbing to so many teens who are trying to create an online space that their parents and teachers can’t find.”
Eilidh Doyle will be a "vote for athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletic Council as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the board of directors.
Doyle is the most honoured Scottish track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those leading the sport to benefit from his various experiences at international level over the past decades.
"Eilidh is highly respected throughout Scotland, the UK, and the world's athletic community and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by bringing him on board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I act as a voice for the athletes and I hope to be able to really contribute and help lead sports in Scotland."
The American athletic, who won the 200m and 400m run at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta among a total of four Olympic gold medals and is now a BBC expert, is now unable to walk after experiencing an ischemic attack for a moment.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today I suffered a stroke a month ago.
I can't walk.
The doctor said only time can determine if I can recover and to what degree it is recovering.
It’s a very tiresome job to get back fully recovered, learn back how to walk, and do today’s agility exercises!
“Thank you for the encouraging messages!”
Breast pump ads comparing mothers to cows have divided opinions in the online world
Breast pump companies have shared opinions in the online world with an ad comparing breastfeeding mothers to a breeding cow.
To mark the launch of a product called "the world's first silently wearable breast pump," consumer technology company Elvie released an advertisement inspired by a joke music video to show the freedom this new pump has been given to express a mother.
Four mothers dancing in the pond containing cow's straw followed a song that included such a lyric: "Yes, I'm sweating on my own, but you don't see the tail" and "If you don't notice it this is not a wing, this is my breasts."
He continued with the refrain: "Pump out, pump out, I feed them dear, pump out, pump out, I suck my wife's milk."
However, the ads that have been published on the company’s Facebook page have sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a diverse response from viewers, with many saying it makes "horrible" in the dairy industry.
"It's a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, cows must also be pregnant and give birth to produce milk, unless their baby is stolen from them within a few days after giving birth.
Elvie breast pump very fit in breastfeeding BH (Elvie/Mother)
Other comments: “Trauma that can be understood for both mother and baby.
But yes, why not use it to advertise a breast pump for a mother who has to take care of her baby?"
Another added: "An advertisement that has no meaning."
Others defended the ad, with a woman admitting that she found the song "funny."
"I think it's a genius idea.
I'll buy it if I'm still breastfeeding.
Squeezing makes me feel exactly like a cow.
It's kind of crazy, but I'm sure it's what it is.
"It's a genius product," someone wrote.
Others commented: "This is a fun ad for hard-working mothers (often in their workplace or toilet) and who feel like "cows."
This is not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they all feel dancing with the hidden pumps that are stuck in their bra.
The basic concept of the campaign comes from the insights of many women who abuse breastfeeding who say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie Pump is completely calm, without cables or tubes and fits inside the breastfeeding bra, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while squeezing.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD at Mother commented: "The Elvie Pump is a pioneering product worthy of being launched with convincing and provocative.
By balancing the picture between expressing women and cows, we want to pump the milk and all its challenges, as well as show it through a way of entertaining and fun with the full freedom presented by the new pump.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump has become the main news.
In London Fashion Week, a mother with two children performed on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski using this product.
Hundreds of Migrants Move Silently to Tent Camp at Texas Border
The number of migrant children detained is increasing even though the monthly border crossing remains unchanged, partly as a result of the harsh statements and policies introduced by the Trump administration that make it difficult to nurture children with sponsors.
Basically, most of the sponsors themselves are documentless immigrants, and fear to jeopardize their own ability to stay in the country by stepping forward to save children.
The risk increased in June, as the federal government announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households had to hand over their fingerprints, and the data would be shared with the immigration government.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official in the field of Immigration and Customs, testified in front of Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who filed an application to sponsor a deceased minor.
The agency then ensured that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal records.
“Almost 80 percent of the people who are sponsors or members of the sponsor group are in the country illegally, and most of them are evil foreigners.
That’s why we keep chasing those people,” said Mr. Albence.
In order to process children more quickly, officials introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within one month of being detained, not after 60 days, which became the standard before, shifting workers to shelters.
Most of them perform through videoconferencing calls, not directly, to apply for their legal status case to the immigration judge.
Those who are deemed not worthy of assistance will be immediately deported.
The longer children are detained, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, resulting in increased violence or attempted escape, shifting workers to shelters and system reports received in recent months.
Lawyers said the concerns increased in larger facilities such as Tornillo, whose signs were present in a struggling child tended to be ignored, because of its size.
They say that moving children to the camp city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or saying goodbye to their friends can aggravate the trauma that has already been fought.
Syria calls on "occupied forces" from the US, France and Turkey to retreat immediately
Speaking in the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the country's war has now entered its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces occupy Syrian land illegally, for reasons to fight terrorism, and "will be dealt with properly."
"They have to retreat as soon as possible and without applying any conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem stressed that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, with more than millions fleeing their homes.
He stressed that Damascus will continue to "fight this holy battle until we clear all the territory of Syria" of the terror group and "the presence of illegal foreign troops."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, in particular training and influencing Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in war-torn territory.
Regarding the refugee problem, Moualem stressed that they should return soon, and he blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading extraordinary fears" that prompted the refugees to move further away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return," he said.
"They politicize what should be a complete humanitarian problem."
The European Union and the United States warn that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition is agreed to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say the latest agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has resulted in opportunities to continue political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey prevented a massive attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem affirmed that the agreement had "clear time limits" and raised the hope that military action would target the mujahideen including fighters from the Nusra Front associated with al-Qaeda, which "will be disbanded."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to quickly convene the first meeting of a new committee consisting of governments and opposition members to make the post-war Law for Syria and pave the way for general elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, asserting that the panel's work should be restricted "to review the latest chapters of the Act," and warning against interference.
Why Trump Will Win the Second Period
According to that logic, Trump will win another general election in 2020 except, as many liberal audiences hope, prosecutions and scandals end his presidency early.
No one doubts, “The end of the most dramatic presidency ever!”
So far, there are no signs of fatigue for the audience.
Since 2014, CNN’s top hour ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million and MSNBC almost tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million mainstream watches, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has peaked on cable TV with 3.5 million viewers on mainstream news night.
"It's a spirit that attracts people because it's something that's not yet understood," said Neal Baer, the host of ABC's "Designated Survivor" drama show, about the cabinet secretary who became president after an attack that destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a senior comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And Some Hard Truths In Sliding to the Hollywood Boys" Club," has another theory.
He recalled riding a taxi in Boston before the 2016 general election.
The driver said he would give Trump the right to vote.
Why? he asked.
"He said, 'Because he made me laugh,'" Miss Scovell said to me.
There is a value of entertainment in a mess.
Certainly, unlike other TV shows, the storyline that emerged from Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether the immigrant family could unite again and restore the global economy.
In turn, the luxury that can only be felt by the most special audience.
However, it’s not just being a knowledgeable citizen at six o’clock when you find yourself watching a panel of experts discussing the use of a “background” source Bob Woodward for his book titled “Fear,” wearing a Trump-owned camel bomber’s jacket about <0x24>15,000 worth of the Washington Post’s “fat clothes” and Daniel’s boast of pride.
This time, I will never see Super Mario in the same way again.
"Part of the policy he's making makes it the same as a reality show that entertains you every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars," about Trump's show-stage players and daily storyline.

Lots of money from outside flooding the toughest part-time election competition in the White House
It was reasonable that Pennsylvania 17 gained a flood of money, thanks to the resettlement of the congressional district that embodied two battlements in the same seat strike.
The recently rearranged Pittsburg district, nominated Conor Lamb from Rep. Democrats - who won seats in other districts through last spring's special election.
Lamb advanced against another contender, the Republic of Keith Rothfus, who now represents the old Pennsylvania 12 district, which overlaps with the new Pennsylvania 17 district.
These maps were rearranged after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January ruled that the old districts were unconstitutionally sided with the Republican party.
Competition in the new Pennsylvania 17 district has resulted in large campaign funds between the major party's financial side, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became increasingly known in Pennsylvania after a thin victory in the March special election that was overseen by the general public for the Pennsylvania 18th Congress District.
The seat has been occupied by Republican officials for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts send the Democratic party a little superior.
U.S. Penalties El Salvador for Supporting China and Retiring
Diplomats ensured that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little pressure from Washington.
President Trump held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and booked a hotel in Panama until his partner expelled the Trump Organization’s management team.
State Department officials have decided to withdraw the head of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over "the latest decision that no longer recognizes Taiwan," Heather Nauert, the department's spokeswoman, said in a statement earlier this month.
However, sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which had received around <0x24>140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which include cuts to financial aid and visa restrictions targeted, will hurt the Central American state and increase unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings took place, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focusing on economic security and prosperity to follow up on the same meeting last year that was considered a step forward to prevent migrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, senior government officials affirmed that they wanted the conference to be continued, in order to effectively end sanctions considerations for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is currently scheduled to give speeches at the conference, currently scheduled for mid-October, as a government-made import signal at the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys secretly returned again to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing a new harsh ban or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate exposed by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal considerations on this unclear situation.
Their statements were reinforced by external analysts close to the government and also spoke about this unclear situation.
The Story of Study
Another surprising story is Robert Mueller’s special adviser’s report on the possible obstacles to Mr. Trump’s trial, which currently has very important evidence in public records.
Mueller’s report also discussed his investigation of whether Trump’s campaign collided with Russia in attacking our general election.
As Congress moves hand in hand, Mr. Trump will be asked for responsibility from himself, just as he prepares to go again in front of voters, and may eventually become a jury of his associates.
So there’s still a lot to do, and I don’t mean to suggest that the fall of Mr. Trump’s rule is inevitable – or its equality in Europe.
There are choices we should make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long we fight.
In 1938, German officials were ready for a coup against Hitler, if only the West against him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We have failed, and missed the opportunity in avoiding the years of subsequent massacres.
The beginning of history centered around the point of such deviation, and the accelerated or delayed stages of democracy were inevitable.
Americans are now facing some of these changes.
What should we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been under pressure since this paper reported that, last year, he suggested that the president be silently recorded and argues that he is not worthy of the presidency.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times account is not true.
"How do we respond if the newly requested F.B.I. investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or fair - or if he is brought to the Supreme Court despite strong allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And besides, will we give a half-time vote for Congress that will ask for Trump’s responsibility?
If we fail to pass that test, democracy will deteriorate in the long run.
But I believe we will succeed, because of the lessons I have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once inhabited my embassy.
He survived, then emigrated to America and, 60 years later, asked me to light a Sabbath candle on a swastika-written table.
By leaving that legacy to me, how can I lose hope for our future?”

Rangers 'Graham Dorrans feel optimistic ahead of the game against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers took over Rapid Vienna on Thursday, struggling to win over Austria, following a good draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will strengthen their position to escape from Group G of the European League.
The knee injury made midfielder Graham Dorrans unable to perform in the first season until a 2–2 draw against Villarreal, but he was confident the Rangers could use the result as a stepping stone towards a bigger ash.
"This is a great point for us because Villarreal is a great team," said the 31-year-old.
“In this game we are sure we can get something and go by picking up one point.
In the end, we might be able to do it but, in our opinion, the balance might be a fair result.
In the first half, they may perform better but in the second half, we got up and became a better team.
Towards Thursday, this evening is another big European day.
We hope to score three points even though it will be a difficult game because they have good results in their last game, but, with the support of the supporters behind us, I’m sure we can keep moving forward and get a positive result.
“Last year we had a hard time, because of what happened as a result of my injuries and changes at the club itself but at the moment there is a very good hope at this club.
This squad is great and the kids really enjoy it. This is a great exercise.
Hopefully now we can thrive, put the past behind us and achieve success."
She couldn't sleep because she was afraid of her retirement savings.
Although it turned out that survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, not many people discussed it with family members.
About half of the people in the Nationwide study discussed the cost of long-term care with their partner.
Only 10 percent of them said they discussed this with their children.
"They want family members to provide care, but there are no steps to start the discussion," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance business.
This is the time to start.
Start talking to your spouse and children: You won’t be able to prepare your own family to provide care if you don’t tell your wishes in advance.
Talk with the counselor and your family, where and how you get treatment, because what you choose will mean is very important in determining the cost.
Engage your financial advisor: Your advisor can certainly help you in showing you how to pay for those costs.
The financing you choose for long-term care includes traditional long-term care insurance policies, hybrid cash insurance policies that guarantee these costs or insure yourself with your wealth – as long as you have money.
Show your legal documents: Face a controversial legal debate.
Appoint immediate power to your health care, that is, someone you trust to ensure your health care and guarantee if your wishes are fulfilled by professional people when you are unable to communicate.
In addition, your financial authority should also be considered.
A trusted person to take care of all your financial decisions should you choose, in addition to making sure you pay your bills if you are not able.
Always remember with every little detail: Just try to imagine when your elderly parents are in an emergency health condition and on their way to the hospital.
Are you ready to answer a variety of questions about both treatment and allergies?
Write down such details so that you are ready to respond.
"It's not just finance that plays an important role, but who the doctor is dealing with?" Martin asked.

Who will the dog be taken care of?

A man shot with a wind gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot with a wind gun on his way home from a night party.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove, Ilfracombe, Devon area, when several shots hit his chest, stomach, and hands.
The shooting was described by officers as occurring around 02:30 BST, and is said to be a "random act."
The victim did not see who attacked her.
The injuries suffered by the victim did not threaten his life and a number of witnesses have been lodged by police.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
The earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, killing at least 384 people, officials said, and the death toll is expected to increase.
The interruption of communication made the officers who channeled aid difficult to get information from Donggala County, a region north of the city of Palu that was located closer to the earthquake center that hit with a 7.5-scale force Richter.
In Palu, after disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated.
Below are some main facts about the cities of Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the narrow end of the bay on the western coast of Sulawesi island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami struck, the city was celebrating its 40th birthday.
Donggala, meanwhile, is a district more than 300 km (180 miles) from the coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The county, which is an administrative area under the province, is estimated to have 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
The economic eye of Andalusia in the province of South Sulawesi is to look for fish and fit plants, especially on the coast of Donggala.
However, the presence of nickel mining also played an important role in the province, although it is mostly centralized in Morowali, across the Sulawesi coast.
In the last 100 years, Palu and Donggala have been hit by a tsunami several times, based on data from Indonesian Disaster Response Agency.
In 1938, more than 200 people died in a tsunami disaster and hundreds of homes in Donggala fell into disrepair.
In 1996, nine people died in a tsunami in western Donggala.
Seismically, Indonesia is located on the Pacific Fire Ring and therefore earthquakes will occur on a regular basis.
The number of earthquakes and tsunami that have hit in recent years is as follows:
2004: December 26, Indonesia was hit by a major earthquake, precisely on the western coast of Aceh province, in northern Sumatra, which also triggered the occurrence of a tsunami in 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, and more than half of the deaths were in Aceh.
2005: In late March and early April, a series of powerful earthquakes have hit the west coast of Sumatra.
On the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra, hundreds of people were killed.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, triggering a tsunami on the southern coast and killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 occurred near Padang, the provincial capital of West Sumatra.
The death toll was more than 1,100.
2010: One of the islands on the islands of Mentawai, outside Sumatra, was also hit by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake, triggering a 10-meter tsunami that suddenly swept dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: Pidie Jaya County, Aceh, also experienced a shallow earthquake and resulted in devastation, as well as the panic of people remembered for the devastation caused by the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
Although this time there was no potential tsunami, more than 100 people died as a result of the collapse of the building.
2018: Lombok, nicknamed the tourist island, also experienced a major earthquake that killed more than 500 people, most of which are on the north side of the island.
The quake ravaged thousands of buildings and temporarily fired thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, Sarah Palin's eldest son, Alaska's former governor and vice presidential candidate, has been arrested in an attack.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, blocking reports of domestic violence and countering arrest efforts, according to Alaska State Police report released on Saturday.
According to police reports, when a woman's contact attempted to call the police to report a suspected crime, he stole the woman's phone.
Palin was handed over to Mat-Su Pre-Judiciary Prison, with a <0x24>500 fine without bail, as reported by KTUU.
As the news network reported, Palin attended the trial on Saturday, declaring himself "innocent, as sure as he is" when asked about his defense.
Palin faced three mild Class A offences, which could make him face a one-year jail term and a <0x24>250,000 fine.
In addition, he was also charged with a Class B criminal charge, with a one-day prison sentence and a <0x24>2,000 fine.
For Palin, this is not the first time a criminal case has been filed.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His own mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to make reports of the alleged attack.
The case is currently filed with the Alaska Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was prosecuted for domestic violence, blocked reports of domestic violence, and possession of a drunken gun, which was also related to the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of beating his face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was convicted by a group of veterans for associating her son's violence with PTSD as a result of her duties in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds dead
On Friday, Indonesia’s island of Sulawesi was hit by a massive earthquake, killing at least 384 people.
The 7.5 magnitude Richter quake that potentially triggered the tsunami has ravaged thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are cut off, as well as death rates are expected to continue to increase over the next few days.
The earthquake then struck Sulawesi in the central part, which is located northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Videos showing how horrific the moment of disaster is circulating widely through social media.
Hundreds of people gathered to celebrate a beach festival in the city of Palu at the time, when the tsunami broke the beach.
Federal prosecutor tries the rare death penalty for suspected terrorist attacks in NYC
The federal prosecutor in New York attempted the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected in a terrorist attack in New York City, where eight people were killed -- the sentence included rare and never been carried out in the federal crime-related state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly carried out an attack by hitting a truck he rented from the Home Depot to pedestrians and cyclists along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must provide evidence that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily injuries, based on a statement of will to drop the death penalty, which was filed in the South District of New York.
Based on the court documents, then both charges allowed for the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal jury clashed with Saipov with 22 charges, including eight murder charges in launching a crackdown, which is usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, as well as allegations of violence and attempted destruction of motor vehicles.
According to prosecutors, the attack required "substantial planning and early maturation," as a picture of Saipov's crime being carried out with "horrible, cruel, and cruel."
Expressed in a statement of will, "Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has resulted in injury, danger, and loss to family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Pagcadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendo, Hernan Alejo, and Hernan Diego Mendo.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York dropped the death penalty for the last time.
In September 2009, Khalid Barnes, accused of murdering two drug suppliers, was eventually sentenced to life in prison.
The last execution of the death penalty in New York's federal court in 1953, was dropped on the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, the couple who were found guilty of espionage conspiracy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Rosenberg was executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, of Uzbekistan, did not show remorse during the days and months following the attack.
When asked by the investigator, he said he was happy with what he had done, police said.
Saipov also revealed to authorities that the attack he carried out was inspired by ISIS videos viewed from his phone, as the content of the charges.
He also asked the ISIS flag to be placed in his hospital room, police said.
He said he was innocent of the 22 charges he had filed against him.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "clearly disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
"In our view, the decision to execute the death rather than accept a criminal application for life imprisonment without a release guarantee will only prolong the trauma of those involved in the incident," Patton said.
Earlier, Saipov's defense team had asked prosecutors not to drop the death penalty.
Nigel Farage is in charge of Brexit negotiations, says Tory MP
Nigel Farage called for "moving the people's troops" today in protest at the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians should "feel the warmth" of the Eurosceptics - because one of the members of parliament, Theresa May, suggested that they take part in negotiations with the EU.
Conservative group supporter Peter Bone told street action in Birmingham that Britain "should have come out" at the moment if Farage were to serve as Brexit secretary.
However, the challenge May faces in the reconciliation of her divided position has been underlined by supporters of Remain Tories who joined separate protests condemning Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to maintain his Chequers compromise plan to stay on track despite amid attacks by Brexiteers, Remainers and the European Union.
The allied countries stressed that he would be pushed forward to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite having a bad reaction - and forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to determine the choice between his proposal package and 'cause'.
Bone told the masses Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to 'get rid of the Chequers.
His proposal, that Farage should appoint colleagues to be given responsibility in negotiations with Brussels.
"If he's still in charge, we're out now," he said.
Wellingborough MEPs added: "I'm ready to stand in support of Brexit, but we need to get rid of the Chequers."
He said, pointing out his opposition to the European Union: "We do not fight in a world war to be subject.
We want to establish our own laws in our own country.”
Bone dismissed the proposal that public opinion could potentially cause change since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people's thinking has changed and wants a permanent condition, it's absolutely not true."
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns, who is also involved in the mass action, told reporters: 'Just simple, I want to say: Prime Minister, listen to your people.
"Chequers are not popular among the general public, while the Opposition will not vote for them, because they are not popular with our party and our activists who really went down the street and made us elected in the first position.
Our request, get rid of the Chequers and start listening to us."
Through a message addressed to May, she added: "The Prime Minister maintains their work when their promise is fulfilled."
Farage said that political demonstrations should be staged in order to “feel its warmth” if they want to deny the 2016 referendum decision.
"The most valuable moment is the trust between us - the people - and our political groups," he said.
"They are trying to deny Brexit and here we are today, affirming to them that 'we will not let you do that'.
He added in a message to the enthusiastic crowd: "I want you to make our political group, which is preparing to deny Brexit, feel its warmth as well.
“We are moving the people of this country who will win us in Brexit and will never give up until the creation of an independent, self-governing, and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, the mass Remainers moved through Birmingham before taking action in the city center for two hours.
The activists’ line appears to be spreading the Tories Against Brexit banner after triggering its line this weekend.
Workers' colleague, Lord Adonis, mocked the Conservative group on the security issues of their party's applications at the opening of the conference.
“These people are telling us that they can master the IT system and all technology for Canada, whatever it is, for the sake of an anti-fighting border, in order to free trade in Ireland without limits,” he said.
“It’s a funny show.
“There is no good Brexit,” he said.
Warren plans to make a 'serious strike' in presidential candidacy
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "shoot the presidential nomination" after the election moment in November.
The Boston Globe reported that Massachusetts' Democratic party declared its future at the town hall in western Massachusetts, on Saturday.
Warren, who frequently denounced President Donald Trump, ran for re-election in November against state GOP representative Geoff Diehl, deputy president of Trump’s campaign in 2016 in Massachusetts.
In national speculation, he was already marked as Trump’s opponent in 2020.
The meeting on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke is the 36th with its voters, which is titled with the town hall format since Trump took office.
A participant asked him if there was a plan to run for president.
Warren replied, that this is the right time "for women to enter the Washington circle in order to restore our corrupt government, and that includes the time for women to occupy the top."
Arrested Sims shooter, LSU player
On Saturday, police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced his arrest of a suspected shooter leading to the death of Wayde Sims, a basketball player from the LSU, on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested at 11 a.m. at an ET press conference.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, in which a man was identified asking for help as seen in the footage.
On Friday morning, 20-year-old Sims was shot and found dead near Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to his head and eventually died," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, via 247sports.
Wayde then wanted to protect his friend and Simpson fired at him.
When interrogated, Simpson confessed to being at the scene, holding a firearm, and shooting him in the direction of Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without meaningful resistance and was stranded in a prisoner in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A junior player with a height of 6 feet 6 inches, growing at Baton Rouge, that's the Sims figure, has played in 32 games with 10 advances last season and an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 pantballs in each game.
Grand Prix in Russia: Lewis Hamilton wins world title after team recognizes victory over Sebastian Vettel
Everything became clear when Valtteri Bottas was ahead of Lewis Hamilton in a qualifying event on Saturday that would bring Mercedes' team's command of having a big role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas had a good starting position and almost left Hamilton as he maintained his position in the first two laps and pulled Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel was the first to jump into the pit and let Hamilton move into density at the end of the crowd, something that was supposed to be very decisive.
Mercedes entered the pit one lap after it and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton continued to drive after several pursuits that showed Ferrari's reluctance to leave the inside empty with the risk of surviving after a double move to survive in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started the start in the back row of the grid and was in seventh position at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led most of the race because he held the tire shift to target a quick settlement and took over Kimi Raikkonen's position for fourth position.
He eventually entered the pit in lap 44 but was unable to increase his step in the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen eventually took fourth position.
It was a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and a real man who let me.
The team has done an incredible job of having one or two," Hamilton said.
It's a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday through her appeals, she did not leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford about sexual violence against potential Supreme Judge Brett Kavanaugh.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly convey Ford's statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee, rather than commenting on what was going on in the Senate showing people who were "bad and deceitful and dishonest."
"Something that can happen and beautiful things are happening over the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and evil, and whore, and who are dishonest," he said.
"When you saw the drain and leak and then they said, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember the answer... did you leak the paperwork - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak it."
Okay, wait a second.
What we leaked... No, we don’t leak it,” he added, as an impression of the senator.
Feinstein had sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford last July, and the matter had leaked earlier in September – but Feinstein claimed the leak did not come from his office.
"I don't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I don't leak his story," Feinstein told the committee.
"He asked me to keep it secret and I kept it as secret as his request."
But the rejection appears to have not been approved by the president, who commented during the rally on Saturday night: "I'll tell you, it's really a very bad body language.
Maybe he didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing his defense against the candidate Supreme Court, who has been accused of sexual harassment against three women, the president is impressed by the assumption that Democrats use the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take power in a variety of ways.
You see crime, greed, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to walk in order to gain power and supervision,” the mediaite said in a statement.
League Elite: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants as he faced Dundee
The Dundee Stars revenge on Friday's defeat in the Elite League while against the Belfast Giants by winning a home game with a score of 5-3 on Saturday.
Giant scored two goals first after two strikes from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought a balanced home before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard equalized the position for Dundee before two goals Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their win.
It was the third Elite League loss this season experienced by the Adam Keefe people, who managed to chase behind and ultimately outperformed to be able to beat Dundee 2-1 at Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting this season between the two sides, with three Giants wins in the previous game.
The opening from Dwyer was present in the fourth minute at 3:35 of the pass given by Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford giving the pass when Beauvillier managed to double the lead four minutes later.
In a dense opening period, Sullivan brought the hosts back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became a feeder for the balancer Cownie did at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' superiority at the first break when he missed his second night goal at the end of the first period.
The hosts reunified and Bouchard once again balanced their position with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen provide an advantage over Dundee for the first time at the end of the match in the second period and he secured a win with his team in the fifth half during the final period.
The Giants, who have so far suffered four defeats from their five games, are in the cage to face Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Driver Dies to Ensure Hundreds of Passengers In Plane Survived From Earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic driver was humiliated as a hero after his death while ensuring that the aircraft carrying hundreds of passengers could fly safely.
More than 800 people have died and many others have disappeared after a major earthquake struck the islands of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering the tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continued to shake the region and many were trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their safety, the 21-year-old man Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in a stunning tower at Sis Al Jufri Pearl Airport, Palu.
He chose to survive to ensure that Air Batik Flight 6321, which was at the time on the runway, could take off safely.
He then jumped from the traffic tower as he felt the tower began to collapse.
He died afterwards in the hospital.
Indonesian Aviation Navigation Services Agency spokesman, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision could save hundreds of lives, reports ABC Australia news.
We provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter managed to reach Palu.
"We're all saddened to hear this," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities are concerned that the death toll could reach thousands after the National Disaster Relief Agency delivered access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong was difficult.
"Victims are believed to continue to increase because many bodies are still in ruins and many others are unattainable," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the national disaster prevention body, said in a statement.
A six-metre wave has caused Palu to break through a slope that caused a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carry aid and various supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings the bodies.
Clean water is rare.
Minimarkets are all over the place."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is working hard to help the survivors but we don’t know what they will find there.
It's been a tragedy, but it might get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and asked the Indonesian national army: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all tasks related to evacuation.
Ready?" reported CNN.
Indonesia earlier this year was also hit by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini reports one missing after lagoon plane crash
The airline operated flights that fell to the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia saying one person had disappeared, having previously been delivered to 47 passengers and crew had been evacuated safely from the plane.
Air Niugini said in a release on Saturday afternoon that it could not identify a male passenger.
The airline said it had cooperated with local authorities, hospitals and inspectors to find the man.
The airline did not respond quickly to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and other crew, after the plane hit the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said the remaining six passengers were in the hospital on Saturday, and they were all in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the sequence of events were completely unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the aircraft landed in a lagoon around the runway.
Some eyewitnesses felt the plane beyond the runway.
U.S. citizen Bill Jaynes said the plane came at a very low level.
"That's really a good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and the others managed to reach the water as high as his waist through the emergency exit on the plane.
He conveyed the pilgrims panicked and shouted, and he suffered a slight head wound.
The U.S. Navy said fishermen working close to the repaired dam also helped rescue using rubber boats to transport people to land before the aircraft sank at a depth of about 30 meters (100 feet) in water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates 111 people have died in a PNG-registered airline crash over the past two decades but none involved Air Niugini.
Analysts Wet the Timeline of Night Women Burned Lively
A detention prosecution took place on Saturday in a re-examination of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He made a headline for the jury about how he used cell phone recordings to collect various movements made by the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of his death.
Rowlett said he received location data from several cell phones showing Tellis was in one location with Chambers on the night of his death, compared to the previous statement of the defendant, Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed the defendant’s cell phone was in one location with Chambers during that time, he argued that he was at the time with his friend Michael Sanford, the police eventually asked for an explanation from Sanford.
Sanford attended the trial on Saturday and he testified that he was not in town on the day of the incident.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was honest when he said he was in a Sanford truck on the night of the incident, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency conveyed by Tellis was his statement that he knew Chambers about two weeks before the victim's death.
Cell phone records indicate they know each other within a week.
Rowlett reported that after Chambers' death, sometimes Tellis removed Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He removed the victims from his life," Hale said.
Defence is scheduled to begin its closing statement on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped the trial would lead to a jury after that day.
The High Breed: What is the spirit of hip hop?
A group of hip hop trio want to challenge the negative views of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, who originated from Bristol, claimed the hip hop movement was far from the origin of political messages and weakened social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make the hip hop spirit popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen the recent rise in the UK through some artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
The other black people?!
NY guards sue couple for attack after issue of "racist" message
A New York nurse sued a couple for having attacked discriminatoryly after receiving an indirect message from a mother who complained and stated that she was "the other black man."
The couple refused if they were considered racist, and considered it more like "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, showed her anxiety when she realized that the new child caregiver, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived on her first day of work in 2016.
"There is no other name," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she even sent it to Miss Maurice, twice.
After realizing his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman fired Miss Maurice, stating that they had fired a nurse, who was an African-American mixed citizen, for having done a ugly job and she was more expecting Filipinos, based in the New York Post.
Miss Maurice was paid for one day of work and then returned to Uber.
Currently, Maurice demands the couple to provide compensation for the dismissal, and demands compensation of around <0x24>350 a day for a six-month period, in exchange for the caregiver job he was initially supposed to work, even without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you can't do something like that," he told the Post on Sunday, adding "I know it's a discrimination."
The couple countered claims that they were racist, stating the worker Maurice fired was a reasonable thing to do, they were worried they could not trust him after insulting him,
"My wife sent me something she didn't mean to.
He's not a racist.
We are not racists," Joel Plasco's husband told the Post.
"But can you let your children be treated by someone you've been married to, even if it's just a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
As wrapped up in “extortion,” Plasco said his wife had just two months to give birth to her baby and was in “a very difficult situation.”
"You're going to chase someone who's in that condition?
That’s not a good thing to do,” the investment banker added.
While the legal case is still ongoing, the public opinion court has made a quick condemnation of the couple on social media, blaming them for their attitudes and logic.
Paddington publishers worry readers will not be related to talk bears, new newspaper reveals
Her daughter Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after her book was received, was described in the letter. "It's very difficult to just talk without knowing her position, reading it the first time before it was published.
It’s funny to know as much as we know about Paddington’s great success.”
His father, who was a BBC cameraman before inspiring through the writing of a children's book with a bear toy, who was very optimistic about the results of his rejected work, added the 60th anniversary of the publication of a book that felt "sweet bitter" after his father's death last year.
For Paddington, whom he described as "a very important member of our family," he added his father was quite proud of the end of his success.
"He's a fairly quiet person, and he's not a proud person," he said.
“But because Paddington means so much to him, it’s like having a child who has achieved something: you’re proud of them even though not all of your efforts.
I think he saw Paddington's success like that.
Although it was the result of his creation and imagination, he always praised Paddington himself."
My daughter is dying and I have to say goodbye to her by phone.
On landing, his daughter was immediately taken to the hospital of Nice Louis Pasteur 2, but the doctors failed to save her.
"Nad made a quiet call to convey it was very bad. that he was very likely not to be safe," Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I got a call from Nad stating he was going to die in the next two minutes and he asked me to say goodbye to him.
And I did it too.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that doctors have given to keep her heart beat slowly and leave her body system.
He had died a few moments while the handling process was ongoing and everything felt deadly.
I could just sit there and wait, understand all this has been revealed.
I couldn’t hug, or scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by family and people.
I really have to hold on to it all."
Finally Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, currently saddened by the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane along with other passengers – without realizing what she had been through.
“No one knows,” he said.
"My head was swollen and my tears kept shivering all the time.
It was very difficult to explain, but when I was on that flight, I felt such deep sympathy for Nad.
That she needs love and understanding from me.
I know how much he loves her.”
Women who are sad post cards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost a loved one try to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted the cards on a bridge in Welsh with inspiring messages and numbers that can be contacted for support.
Ms. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 years old when she began suffering from depression and suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parents to feel the way I feel every day,” he said.
Ms. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knows him from his smile.
They always say that his smile illuminates the atmosphere.”
But, she stopped working before she died, like she was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis said: "I'm constantly worried that there will be a lasting effect."
Mrs. Davis made the cards, "to tell people that there is someone else out there you can get near and talk to, even if they are a friend.
Don't sit down and shut up - you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after her mother died.
"He didn't say if he felt sad or depressed or anything," he said.
“A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was at his lowest point on Christmas Day - when the kids opened their presents he didn't look into their eyes or anything."
He said his death was a great trauma for them, but they had to go through it: “It made a gap in the family.
It separates us.
But we have to go through it and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is uncertain when the FBI starts its investigation.
"I think, if we really get something like what he asks for - an investigation that is limited in its time, limited in its scope - we might be able to bring a bit of unity," Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid of the committee being "destroyed" amid the blockade of the council's ruling.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their deficiency is all due to time.
Legislative elections remain for another five weeks, on November 6 – if, as expected, the Republicans did poorly, they would be very weak in their chances of making the people they want to be elected to sit in the highest court there.
George W. Bush has contacted the Senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who works at the White House for Mr. Bush and through it meets his wife Ashley, who is Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happened after the FBI made the report?
There will be an election in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sit.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh could get at least 50 votes among the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to determine the winner and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Koreans 'angels' below Kim
The number of people travelling from North Korea to South Korea has drastically declined since Kim Jong-un took office seven years ago, said a member of the Korean parliament.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South's unification ministry, said there were 1,127 turnovers last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said control of the border between North Korea and China and higher tariffs imposed by people smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang did not make public comments.
Most immigrants from the North were eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 people from North Korea have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the Demilitarization Zone between the two Koreas.
China treats smugglers as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forces them to return.
Relations between North and South - which are technically still at war - have greatly increased in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang for talks centered on postponed denuclearization negotiations.
This happened after a historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in a broad sense to cooperate on a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the U.S. sanctions for its lack of development since.
"Without confidence in the U.S., there would be no confidence in our national security and in that situation, it would be impossible for us to unilaterally drop our weapons," Ri said in a speech in the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi accuses Brett Kavanaugh of being "hysterical," saying he is not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
Opposition leader Nancy Pelosi accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of being "hysterical" and said he was not temperamentally fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't avoid the thought that if a woman's performance was like that, they would say 'hysterical'," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Judicial Council Commission on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that she had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both adolescent.
In his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, several times almost screaming and having difficulty speaking when discussing his family and his years during high school.
He also blatantly condemned Democrats in the committee, saying the charges against him were "unreasonable and coordinated character killings" organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he was biased towards Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself with those statements and with his attitude towards Clinton and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi objected if he would try to claim if he was approved, and if Democrats gained more votes in the House of Representatives.
"I would say this -- if he didn't say the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he wasn't fit not only to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is now a judge at the D.C. High Court.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat he was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential judgment against the Health Services Act or Roe v. Wade, as he was seen as a proponent of conservative justice.
In the appointment hearing, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“It’s not the time for someone who is hysterical and biased to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Isn’t that great,’” Pelosi said.
And women have to deal with it.
It was an ethical chaos, anger for months and years, and he couldn’t take it out without crying.
“We were crying when we were angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, what do you think?"
She continues, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was an executive somewhere, who said that she was also crying when she was angry, but developed a technique that meant that she was angry and started crying, she would say to the person who was talking to her, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then he went on.
And I think it's brilliant."
Tears are removed as a way out of anger in part because he is basically misunderstood.
One of my strongest memories of early work, in a man-dominated office, once when I cried with inexpressible anger, was my throat squeezed by an older woman — a cold manager I was always a little afraid — who dragged me down the stairs.
"Never let them see you crying," he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be happy because they think they’ve succeeded.”
Patricia Schroeder, a congressman from Colorado, once worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in a non-marriage scam on a boat called Monkey Business and resigned from the election, Ms. Schroeder was very frustrated, realizing that there was no reason for herself not to run for president.
"It's not a thoughtful decision," he told me laughing 30 years later.
“There are seven other candidates in the election, and the last thing they need is a new candidate.
Someone called her "The Snow Princess and the Seven Turtles."
Because it was too late in the campaign, he was left behind in fundraising, and so he swore he would not follow the election unless he managed to raise <0x24>2 million.
It was a fight that ended in defeat.
He found that some of his supporters who gave <0x24>1,000 to the man gave him only <0x24>250.
"Do they think I get a discount?" he asked.
As he announced that he was not going to launch a formal campaign, he was too dominated by emotion - a sense of gratitude to those who supported him, frustration with the system that made fundraising so difficult and to target voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism - made him difficult to speak up.
"You'll probably think I'm too nervous," remembers Miss Schroeder about how the press reacted to her.
“You’ll think that Kleenex is my sponsoring company.
I remember, thinking, what would they write in my nisan?
"He's crying?"
How U.S.-China Trade Competition May Be Good for Beijing
The opening shot of trade competition between the US and China was so overwhelming, and while the fight is still far from over, the gap between the two countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, according to experts.
US President Donald Trump fired his first warning earlier this year by imposing taxes on key Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
A very significant increase was imposed starting this week with new tariffs affecting goods worth <0x24>200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively imposing taxes on half of all goods entering the U.S. via China.
Beijing has responded every time, recently imposing tariffs of five to ten percent on US goods worth <0x24>60 billion.
China has requested to equalize the U.S. one-on-one, and the world’s second largest economy will not change in the near future.
Inviting Washington to step down means following the will, but publicly blaming the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say if Beijing can play its cards correctly, the pressures of U.S. trade competition can positively support China in the long run by reducing the dependence between the two economies.
"The fact that Washington or Beijing's rapid political decision could make conditions triggering economic movements in both countries actually more dangerous than previously known observers," said Abigail Grace, a fellow researcher focused on Asia at the Center for New American Security, an expert agency.
Syria 'prepared' for the return of refugees, according to foreign minister
Syria said it was ready for the return of refugees and offered assistance to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in his country improved.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safe thanks to progress in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore them as they were.
All conditions are now present due to the return of refugees voluntarily to a country they must leave because of terrorism and comprehensive economic decisions that make their daily lives and their livelihoods the target.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled their country since the war began in 2011.
The other six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would receive aid to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that they would not receive any assistance or conditional assistance from countries that support the uprising.
Europe to win Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the Ryder Cup defeating the US team with a final score of 16.5 and 10.5 at Le Golf National outside of Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six consecutive times on European soil and has never won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.

It's been a difficult year.
Thank you very much Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I am very happy, very happy to get the trophy back.
It’s about the team, and I’m glad I can help,” Garcia said emotionally after the European victory.

There was a time this morning when we made Europe difficult.
We're fighting.
Respect for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We will reorganize, I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will move forward.
I love these 12 people and I am proud to be a captain.
You have to pay tribute.
We've lost overtime."
