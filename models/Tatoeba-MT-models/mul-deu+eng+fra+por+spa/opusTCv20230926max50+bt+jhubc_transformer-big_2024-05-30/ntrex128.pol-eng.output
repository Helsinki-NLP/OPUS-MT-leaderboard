Members of the Welsh National Assembly fear they will be called muppets
Among some members of the National Assembly there was consternation. This is the result of a proposal to change their title to Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP).
The idea was created in connection with the plans to transform the assembly into the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly from all sides of the political scene are concerned that they may become the subject of beds.
One of the Labour MPs expressed concern about his grouping, saying that the new name coincides with the Welsh words “twp” and “pwp”.
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh the word “twp” means stupid, and the word “pwp” means exodus.
One of the politicians of Plaid Cymru said his grouping was “dissatisfied” with the proposal and presented other solutions.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his party was "open" to change its name, but noted that the word "MWP" is very close to the word "muppet".
In this case, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similar to the letter "u" in the English dialect of Yorkshire.
As part of the meeting, the committee, which is currently working on the bill renaming, took the following position: “Naturally, the final decision on the future title of the members of the meeting will be their own.”
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultations on the proposal. The conversion of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament gained broad support.
In addition, the Commission supported the proposal to change the title of the members of the Assembly to the “Wales Parliament Member”, the WMP in English, although the abbreviation “MWP” was the most popular among the public.
Members of the assembly propose alternative solutions. Difficulties to reach a consensus are a mess for Elin Jones, the chairman of the assembly, who is expected to present the bill in the coming weeks.
The Reform Act will also take into account other changes in the way the Assembly works, including the principle of repeal of members and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly will be able to vote on their future title when discussing the law.
Macedonians Vote in Referendum on Change of Country Name
Next Sunday, voters will decide whether their country will soon be renamed the Republic of North Macedonia.
The general vote is intended to help spark a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, where the region is called Macedonia.
The government in Athens has long claimed that the name of their northern neighbor is a territorial claim, and has repeatedly opposed attempts to join the European Union and NATO.
<0xC7><0xB4>orge Ivanov, the president of Macedonia and opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he would underestimate the results of the vote.
However, supporters of the plebiscite, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, maintain that a change is necessary to allow the country to join the European Union and NATO.
The bells of St. Marcin’s New York Church will be silenced due to the problems of the church in Harlem
“The older people I’m talking to say that there was a bar and a church in every corner before,” said Michael Henry Adams.
"At the moment, there is no trace of them."
As they say, the disappearance of bars is understandable.
“Actually, people are socializing in a different way,” he noted.
“The bars have ceased to be a place for regular meetings of community members.”
In the case of churches, however, he is concerned that funds from the sale of property are not sufficient for as long as the decision-makers think, and that “sooner or later they will be at the point of departure.”
He added that churches could be replaced by apartments inhabited by people who would not support the other surrounding temples.
As he said, “The overwhelming majority of people who buy homes in such buildings will be white. This will accelerate the total closure of churches, because it is unlikely that new residents will become members of these parishes.”
Both churches were built by a gathering of white faithful, even before Harlem joined the metropolitan community in 1870 (the church of St. Marcin joined the community a decade later).
The original gathering of white Methodists left the district in the 1930s. . . .
The surrounding Afro-American assembly then took over the property rights to the building.
The church of St. Marcin was taken over by a assembly led by the Honourable John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of 125th Street (the main commercial street in Harlem) against the recruitment or promotion of Afro-Americans.
The fire of 1939 severely damaged the building, but John Howard Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild the temple and ordered the construction of a bell tower.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of John Howard Johnson and his successor at St. Marcin's Church, proudly called the new carylion "the dreams of the poor".
The expert, who knocked out the bells in July, described them in a different way, as "cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that it is the world’s first carylion to be served by black musician, artist Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the Riverside Church 18 years ago, where he was waiting for the horn.
Malcolm J. Merriweather said that St. Marcin's church did not replace him.
In recent months, a number of complex events took place in St. Marcin’s Church with the participation of architects and performers, some of which were brought to the place by the secular leaders of the church, and some — the diocese of the Episcopal Church.
In July, the parish council (the governing body of the parish composed of secular leaders) addressed its concerns to the diocese, claiming that "it wants to shift costs to the council", although the council did not take part in the hiring of architects and local artists.
Part of the parish also complains about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A 13-year-old shark injured in search of ants in California
Authorities said last Saturday that a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old diver in search of homards in California, the incident occurred on the first day of the season.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in the American city of Encinitas.
Chad Hammel reported to KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday morning he had been diving with friends for about half an hour when he heard a call for help. Immediately with a group of friends swam to the boy to help him get out of the water.
As Hammel said, at first it seemed to him that the boy was excited about catching a homara, but soon he realized that the child was screaming: “I was bitten!
I've been bitten!"
Upon arriving at the scene, Chad Hammel noticed that the boy had completely broken skin in the vicinity of the abdomen.
“I started yelling at everyone to run away from the water, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Children's Council Hospital in San Diego, where his condition was described as critical.
The species of shark responsible for the attack remains unknown.
During a press conference, rescue captain Larry Giles said the fish had been spotted a few weeks earlier, but it was recognized that it was not a species of endangered sharks.
Larry Giles added that the victim suffered serious injuries to the upper part of the tulle.
In order to conduct the investigation and for security reasons, the authorities closed the entrance to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami Beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours.
Larry Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, although most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's network of stores plans to expand its operations in the UK cosmetic market
Sainsbury's network throws gloves at stores such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, introducing stylish cosmetics departments to their supermarkets, as well as specially trained merchants.
As part of the significant investment in the UK cosmetic market – which is worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and is constantly evolving despite the declines in the fashion industry and household items – in 11 stores belonging to the network, there will be larger shelves on the shelves.
The return to the cosmetic industry results from the search for ways to master the space previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and household articles.
According to Sainsbury's, the network will double the number of cosmetic products and will offer up to 3,000 items. In the assortment, goods such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman or Dr. PawPaw will appear for the first time.
Currently sold items from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space and separate areas close to those well-known even from Boots stores.
In addition, the supermarket network plans to refresh its range of boutique makeup products. From now on, most of the items will be vegan friendly, which is increasingly demanded by young customers.
In addition, fragrance shop will create test points at two Sainsbury's supermarkets. The first opened last week in Croydon, south of London, and the second will be held in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
The prevalence of online sales and daily purchases of small amounts of food in local stores makes supermarkets more likely to encourage customers to visit.
Mike Coupe, president of Sainsbury's, said sales points will increasingly resemble warehouses, as the network is trying to fight discounts like Aldi or Lidl, offering more services and products than food.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos points in hundreds of stores and has introduced a number of Habitat points since the acquisition of both companies two years ago. According to the company, this contributes to increased sales of food items and increase the return on investment.
The previous attempt to reorganize departments with cosmetics and pharmaceuticals ended in failure.
At the beginning of the 21st century Sainsbury's created a joint-venture company with Boots to try. However, the cooperation was terminated following a conflict over the distribution of revenue from pharmacies operating in supermarkets.
Sainsbury’s is introducing a new strategy following the sale of 281 pharmacies to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
According to reports, Lloyds will contribute to the implementation of the plan by introducing an expanded range of luxury brands for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four online stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Chief Commercial Officer, said: “We have transformed the appearance and nature of cosmetics departments to improve the customer experience.
We have invested in special training for colleagues so that they can help consumers when shopping.
Our brands are able to meet all the needs, and the friendly environment and convenient locations allow us to attract the attention of customers looking for cosmetic products, as well as to question the current ways of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'Angry' After Holly Willoughby's Withdrawal from <0xC2><0xA3>11 Million Contract
Peter Jones, the star of Dragons' Den, was "raged" when he learned that Holly Willoughby plans to step down from the <0xC2><0xA3>11 million lifestyle brand to focus on a newly established partnership with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Holly Willoughby has no time for their brand offering accessories and household items under the name True.
The activity was often compared to the Goop brand belonging to Gwyneth Paltrow.
This morning, the 37-year-old actress announced her departure via Instagram.
The sudden decision to leave the well-produced lifestyle brand and to focus on a newly established partnership with Marks & Spencer and ITV, made Holly Willoughby angry Peter Jones, the star of Dragons' Den.
According to sources, Peter Jones was "enraged" when popular television presenter announced during a nervous Tuesday meeting at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire that due to the new contracts, he would have a house worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million and would have no time to spare.
The company was previously compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop, and was also expected to double Holly Willoughby's assets, estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
After announcing the decision to leave the True brand by 37-year-old Holly Willoughby on Instagram, Peter Jones left the UK, going to one of his summer homes.
According to the source, “The True brand was a priority for Holly Willoughby.
She was bound by her future and wanted to take care of her for the next few decades.
The decision to withdraw from the business completely surprised all the people involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday. It was so close to entering the market.
In the Warehouse in Marlow there are goods ready for sale."
Experts believe the resignation of This Morning presenter and one of the UK’s most successful stars could cost the company millions of pounds due to significant investments in products – including articles from pillows to candlesticks to clothes to houseware.
It can also mean the end of a long-term friendship.
Holly Willoughby (mother of three children) and her husband Dan Baldwin have been in close relationship with Peter Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Holly Willoughby and Tara Capp founded the True brand in 2016, and 52-year-old Peter Jones joined them in March as president.
The couple spent their holidays together, and Jones had a 40 percent stake in Dan Baldwin’s television production company.
Holly Willoughby is set to become M&S ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Peter Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his business affairs.”
A difficult conversation, “and then we fell in love”
The president joked from criticism of the media for a remark that some considered to be “unattached to the husband of the state” as well as a positive attitude to the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in a ridiculous voice, calling the TV presenter:
“I didn’t give up anything.”
The president pointed out that Kim Jong Un is interested in the second meeting. The first meeting took place in Singapore in June and was yelled by Trump a big step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations on nuclear disarmament are delaying.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomacy chief Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that he saw no “analogous response” from the United States.
He noted that instead, the United States maintains sanctions and pressures.
President Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
“We’re doing great with North Korea,” he said.
“We were planning a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a great relationship.”
The president said his efforts to improve relations with Kim Jong Un had a positive effect: they ended missile tests, helped free the hostages, and brought the rest of the U.S. troops home.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach while discussing relations with Kim Jong Un.
“It’s easy to behave after the presidency, but instead of 10,000 people waiting outside and trying to get to the crowded stadium, we’d have 200 people here,” Trump said, pointing his finger at the crowd gathered in front of him.
Tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia have devastated one of the islands, killing hundreds of people
After the earthquake on the island of Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that their assistance was not needed.
Despite the loss of a roof overhead by more than 10% of Lombok residents, the authorities have not declared a food disaster, which is a necessary condition for accelerating international aid activities.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, the authorities have made it very clear that they do not require international support, so the situation is difficult,” said Selina Subung.
While Save the Children is preparing for a trip to the Indonesian city of Palu, it is not yet certain whether international staff will be able to operate on the scene.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Agency for Nutritional Disasters, said Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if aid should be granted by international organizations.
In the face of the constant shocks in Indonesia, the country remains completely unprepared to deal with the forces of nature.
Although Tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh province, they are rare for the rest of the coastline.
The lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, despite a warning, was likely to have affected the death toll.
Even in the most favourable conditions, travelling between Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Nutritional disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The hospital ship, which was stationed on the island of Lombok, is heading with assistance for the earthquake victims to the city of Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the destination.
President Joko Widodo has made improvements to Indonesian infrastructure the main point of his campaign and has allocated a lot of funds on roads and railways.
However, in the face of next year’s elections, the presidential administration is struggling with a lack of funds.
In addition, Joko Widodo found himself under pressure due to the ongoing tensions in the country on a religious basis. Members of the majority of the Muslim community have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than a thousand people have died, and tens of thousands of residents have lost their roof over their heads as a result of clashes between Christian and Muslim gangs using masks, bows, shotguns and other simple weapons on the streets.
Liverpool footballer Daniel Sturridge wins a goal at Chelsea's home run
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the English Premier League, scoring a goal in the 89th minute of Saturday's game played at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge was given a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri at about 27 metres from Chelsea's goal with a 1-0 condition to the detriment of his team.
Before giving the shot in the direction of the distant goal he put the ball on his left leg.
The ball accelerated high above the penalty field in the direction of the upper right corner of the net.
Then she went into the gate, flying over the slope of Kepa Arrizabalaga.
“I was just trying to take the position and accept the ball, knowing that players like Shaqiri are always trying to get it as far ahead as possible. I wanted to give myself the best shot chance,” Sturridge said in an interview with LiverpoolFC.
"I noticed Kante approaching, I took the ball and gave the shot without any deeper thought."
Chelsea scored 1-0 in the middle of the game after Belgian star Eden Hazard was shot in the 25th minute.
The attacker of the Blues dropped the fifth ball to Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87>, then ran towards half Liverpool.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> quickly accepted the application in the middle of the field.
Then he made a beautiful play forward in the penal field back to Hazard.
Gambled ahead of the defenders and left footed off the long pole of a shot that passed Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Naples in the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 15:00 at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples (Italy).
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3:00 p.m. in London.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
According to Indonesia’s natural disaster agency, the number of victims of the recent earthquake and tsunami in the country has risen to 832.
During the conference, spokesman for the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said that as a result of Friday's 7.5-degree earthquake on the Richter scale, many people were trapped under gravel. In addition, the shock caused a tsunami wave of 6 meters high.
Inhabited by more than 380,000 people, the city of Palu is full of cluttered buildings.

Cromwell's Monument to the Last Victim of a "Rewriting History" Controversy
The removal of the monument would bring justice for the actions of the Taliban reminiscent of the destruction of many English cultural and religious monuments by its radical, puritanist supporters.
However, the Cromwell Society described Jeremy Crick’s proposal as “crazy” and “trying to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “Given the ongoing debate on the removal of monuments, the dispute over the character of Oliver Cromwell before Westminster Palace was a matter of time.
Illustrative actions during the English Civil Wars were neither commissioned nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps for the actions of his predecessor Thomas a century earlier it was decided not to punish Cromwell.
The way in which Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft presented Cromwell at the memorial shows what the 19th-century politician enjoyed and that he is a figure that is still worth remembering for many.
John Goldsmith said in an interview with The Sunday Telegraph: “Through many people, Cromwell was seen – perhaps more often in the 19th century than he is today – as a defender of parliament against external pressures.
The assessment of the validity of this statement is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
It is certain, however, that the conflict of the mid-17th century has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable character identifying one of the sides of the division.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be honored and commemorated."
In China, a pig kills a farmer.
According to local media, a deadly pig attack on a farmer occurred at a trade fair in southwestern China.
On Sunday, the South China Morning Post reported that a dead man named Yuan was found bleeding and having a broken artery near a bread market in the city of Liupanshui, in the province of Kueizhou.
A pig breeder is preparing for vaccination at a farm on May 30, 2005, in Xining City, Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, the man came to the fair with his cousin from the neighboring province of Junnan to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning the cousin found the body of the man and noticed the open door to the nearby bread.
He said that there was a big request in the bread with blood on the dough.
The body section confirmed that it was a nearly 250-pound pig that fatally disturbed the farmer.
“My cousin’s legs were bleeding and pointing,” said a man named Wu, quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance camera material shows that Yuan arrived at the market on Thursday at 4:40 p.m. to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The store manager said in an interview with Guiyang Evening News that during the gathering of evidence, the police were asked to be isolated to avoid another attack.
According to reports, the family of the man and the trade authorities are negotiating compensation for death.
In the past, cases of pig attacks on humans have been reported, although they are a rare occurrence.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, where a man suffered fatal injuries.
Ten years earlier in Wales, a nearly 300-kilogram-pound pig drove a farmer into a tractor, and the man’s wife managed to pull the animal.
After eating a farmer from Oregon by pigs in 2012, one of the farmers in Manitoba told CBC News that these animals are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can release brutal behavior in them.
“They just want to have fun.
They're as curious as children... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them proper respect,” he said.
Residues after Hurricane Rosa will cause heavy rainfall in the southwestern part of the United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is losing power, moving over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days it will cause heavy rainfall in northern Mexico and the southwestern part of the United States.
Hurricane Rosa flew at a speed of almost 137 km/h. On Sunday at 5:00 Eastern time he was given category 1. It was then 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
According to the forecast on Sunday, Rosa will move to the north.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean, it begins to form as it is heading east to the western coast of the United States. On Monday, Rosa will approach the California Peninsula in the form of a tropical storm, moving the wetlands to the wetlands.
On Monday it will bring up to 25 cm of rainfall to part of the territory of Mexico.
In the coming days, wet tropical air coming into contact with the approaching low will cause heavy rainfall in the Southwest of the United States.
In some places, precipitation at an altitude of 2.5 to 10 cm will lead to sudden flooding, pollution displacement and possible spills in desert areas.
Wet tropical air will cause rain anywhere from 5 to 7.5 cm per hour, especially in parts of Nevada and Arizona.
Even 5 to 10 cm of rain is predicted in some parts of the US Southwest, especially over much of Arizona.
Due to the widespread nature of tropical rainfall, sudden flooding and violent changes in conditions are possible.
In the face of the threat of tropical rain, it is definitely advisable to move on foot through the desert.
Abundant lews can turn cannons into rivers, and thunderstorms with thunderstorms will cause local strong winds and dust to move.
Coming soon will bring abundant local rainfall on the southern coast of California.
Rainfall at a total height of more than 1.3 cm is possible, which can cause minor pollution movements and hazards on the roads.
This would be the first rainfall in the region.
Tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona on late Sunday and early Monday. On Monday afternoon and on Tuesday, the rains will occur in a greater number of areas.
On Tuesday, heavy rains will reach the Four Corners region in the western part of the United States and last until Wednesday.
In October, along with cooling in the Arctic region, temperature fluctuations may occur throughout the United States. However, in the intervertebral zone it will be rather warm.
This can lead to violent temperature changes over short distances.
A good example is the Sunday temperature differences in the central part of the United States.
Between Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska) and between St. Louis (Missouri) and Des Moines (Iowa) these differences are almost 10 degrees Celsius.
In the coming days, the remaining summer temperatures may rise again.
Temperatures are expected to fluctuate between 26 and 32 degrees Celsius in the area from the southern part of the Great Plains to the northeast in the United States in early October. The temperatures are expected to fluctuate from 26 to 32 degrees Celsius in the southern part of the Great Plains to the northeast.
On Tuesday in New York, temperatures can reach up to 27 degrees Celsius, which is about 5 degrees above average.
Long-term climate forecasts indicate a high likelihood of over-average temperatures in the east of the United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s interview
More than 20 million people watched six television stations on Thursday interviewing Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Christina Blasey Ford, the woman who accused a lawyer of sexual harassment in the eighties.
Despite the ongoing political impasse on Friday, commentators had to stop regularly broadcasting programs to report an emergency response: an agreement proposed by Senator Jeff Flake, according to which the FBI will conduct a weekly investigation into the charges.
Christine Blasey Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Commission that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh was hiding her in a state of inconsistency and trying to take off her clothes at a high school party.
In his emotional testimony, however, Kavanaugh said that he was convinced that such a situation did not take place.
It is possible that the number of TVs on Friday was even higher than the <0x24>20.4 million reported by Nielsen.
The company counted the average number of television stations CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
However, for other stations, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, no figures were yet available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring viewability among people in the workplace.
The number given is approximated to the viewing of the American Football Cup games or the awards of the American Film Academy.
According to Nielsen, the Fox News Channel station, whose speakers strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, had the highest viewership, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during a full-day interview.
In second place was the ABC station with 3.26 million spectators.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million.
Interest in the subject remained high after the end of the hearing.
Jeff Flake became the key character of Friday's events.
In the morning he was captured by CNN and CBS cameras after the office of the moderate Republican issued a statement that he had decided to support Kavanaugh's nomination. In the recording, he shouts at the protesters who made it difficult for him to enter the van during a hearing.
Flake, with his head down for a few minutes, listened to unpleasant reviews. The whole event was broadcast on CNN.
“I stand here in front of you and ask.
Do you think he's telling the people the truth?
You have the strength in the face of the powerlessness of so many women,” he heard from a demonstrating woman.
Before closing the door, Jeff Flake said that his office had issued an appropriate statement and that he would speak during the hearing of the commission.
Later, television stations continued to broadcast events pending a vote on Kavanaugh's nomination before the entire Senate.
Flake said he would support the nomination only if he knew the FBI would investigate the charges next week, which a minority of Democrats insisted on.
Flake was partially persuaded by a conversation with his friend, Senator Chris Coons of the Democratic Party.
Flake made the decision after meeting with Chris Coons and several other senators.
Flake's choice was important because Republicans would not have the votes needed to approve Brett Kavanaugh's nomination without an investigation.
President Trump has filed a lawsuit against the FBI on charges filed against Brett Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of using Brexit for their own benefit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of playing the future of Britain and undermining the national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham (UK) on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with Theresa May on the title page, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson in her administration attacked a plan for future relations with the European Union in the wake of Brexit, according to which the UK and the EU could not, in the name of a “customer, charge tariffs”.
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police Arrested Dyteon Simpson Suspected of Murder of LSU Player
Police have arrested a suspect in connection with the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player in the colors of the University of Louisiana (LSU).
According to reports, Baton Rouge police commander Dyteon Simpson, aged 20, was arrested and placed in detention on second-degree murder charges.
Authorities have released a footage of a confrontation between Sims and Simpsons, and police have reported that during the battle, Sims lost his glasses.
According to a CBS-linked WAFB station, police officers found the glasses on the spot and detected traces of Simpson's DNA on them.
Police informed Simpson after his interrogation that he had confessed to firing Wayde.
According to the detainee's lawyer, the amount of the bail was set at <0x24>350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Coroner's office released a preliminary report on Friday saying the cause of the death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The police commander thanked the Louisiana state police search group, the state police criminal lab, the Southern University police and nearby residents for their assistance in the investigation leading to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU’s director of sports, thanked the local prosecution authorities for “working and seeking justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge and his father, Wayne Sims, also played basketball at the LSU.
In his last season, he scored an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 points per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“It’s one of those things we’re constantly worried about,” said Will Wade.
Ash emitted by volcano reaches Mexico City
The ash extracted from the Popocatépetl volcano reached the southern districts of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Center for the Prevention of Nutritional Disasters prevented residents of Mexico from approaching the volcano due to increased activity in the crater and 183 cases of gas and ash emissions over a 24-hour period.
The center has recorded a number of stunts and shocks.
Images posted on social media show the front windows of cars covered with a thin layer of ash in Mexico’s neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Since the 7.1-degree earthquake that visited Mexico in September 2017, geophysicists have seen an increase in activity of the volcano located 72 km southeast of the country's capital.
The volcano, also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
The start of the police with the Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence referendum
On Saturday in Barcelona, six people were arrested as a result of the efforts of demonstrators in support of Catalonia's independence with preventive police branches. On that day, thousands of people took part in enemy demonstrations commemorating the first anniversary of the cataclysm in the wake of the emotion.
A group of masked separatist supporters cast eggs and powder paint on police officials. Dark clouds of dust covered the streets usually full of tourists.
The effort also took place later in the day. To stop the fighting, the police used a stick.
For several hours, groups supporting independence chanted “We don’t forget, we don’t forgive”, while opponents of the secession shouted “Let Spain live.”
According to the local press, 14 people received medical assistance in connection with the minor injuries sustained during the protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum, the tension did not weaken. Although it was considered illegal by the authorities in Madrid, it is still a reason to celebrate for Catalan secessionists.
The majority of the voters were in favour of independence, but the frequency was low due to the widespread boycott of opponents.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly a thousand people were injured last year in brutal efforts with police trying to prevent voting in polling stations.
On Friday evening, a group of supporters of the region’s independence decided to prevent demonstrations supporting policemen.
The demonstration took place in spite of this, however, a change of route was forced.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said there was no longer hope for Catalonia's independence.
“Last year we experienced one of the most beautiful moments in our lives.
My parents were crying with joy that they could vote, but now we are stuck in a point of no way out," he said.
Despite the significant, but small victory in the local elections in December last year, the parties supporting the secession of Catalonia have struggled with the continuation of the action. Many of the most recognized leaders have decided to leave with a more decisive approach and are not waiting for a referendum in the arrest process.
Joan Puig, a 40-year-old mechanic who recorded a phone protest in support of the police, said politicians on both sides of the dispute were sparking conflict.
“The situation is getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders detained since the end of last year, announced his willingness to start next year’s European Parliament elections.
"Candiding in the elections to the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the crisis of the democratic values of the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Man Arrested After Car Entering Home
Three men, aged 33, 34, and 39, were arrested following a multiple car crash in a home in Londonderry.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 7:30pm British Time (BST).
Commissioner for Investigation Bob Blemmings said the damage covered the gate and the building.
At some point in the direction of the car could also be given a shot from the clock.
Mengi's goal ensures Livingston's win over the Rangers 1-0
Dolly Menge's first goal for Livingston brought the team a victory
Since this season, the extra-class club Livingston has shocked the Rangers, giving Steven Gerrard only his second defeat in his 18 games as the club's coach from Ibrox Park.
Dolly Mengi's goal turned out to be a win, and Gary Holt's team moved to second place in the table with Hibernian.
The team under the leadership of Gerrard will remain without a Premiership win this season. Next Sunday, the team will face the leader of Hearts, to which he loses eight points.
Earlier on Thursday, the Rangers will be hosting Rapid Vienna as part of the UEFA Europa League matches.
Livingston is extending a series of victories in his division to six matches. Coach Holt has not experienced a failure since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed several occasions against indisposed opponents
The team led by Holt was supposed to have taken over the lead much earlier, as the team's play caused Rangers a lot of problems.
First, Scott Robinson broke through the defense and gave the shot to the light of the goal, but he failed to shoot the goal. Then Alan Lithgow did not hit after taking over Craig Halkett's head.
The hosts allowed Rangers to play closer to the gate, knowing that they could threaten rivals during the permanent fragments of the game.
And that's how the decisive gate fell.
After the Rangers took a free throw, the Livingston team found the opportunity. Declan Gallagher and Robinson together created the situation of Mendz, who scored a goal from the middle of the field.
At this stage, the Rangers had more possessions, but were unable to refute the host's defenses and did not cause major problems to goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
This pattern was repeated in the second half, and Alfredo Morelos scored one shot at Kelly's goal.
Scott Pittman's attempt was armored by Ranger goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow was unable to hit the gate from another permanent fragment convicted for Livingston.
The Rangers continued the attacks in the Livingston Penal Field, but were unable to take advantage of the situation. They filed two penalties after Halkett intervened against alternator Glenn Middleton and one by hand. In both cases, however, the players' claims were rejected.
“Fenomenal” performance of Livingstone – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Almondvale Park
Great performance and result for Livingston.
In his opinion, they played great, once again exceeding expectations.
Their style and composition have barely changed since their return to the extra class. However, Holt should be appreciated for motivating the team to play.
This game had a lot of heroes.
Captain Craig Halkett played a huge role in leading a well-organized defense, while Menga made Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall have had to be very careful throughout the game.
Rangers didn't want to fight.
Although Gerrard had great moments under the water, they did not meet their standards in this match.
There seemed to be something missing in their game: only once managed to break through the host's defense. This should be a serious warning to the Rangers, who were in the middle of the table.
Mixed reactions to Erdogan’s visit to Cologne
During the Saturday breakfast in Berlin (September 29), the leaders of Turkey and Germany accompanied a smile and beautiful weather.
This was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aimed to improve relations between allies and NATO.
Disputes have led to differences in issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the European Union.
After the meeting, Erdogan went to Cologne, where he opened a new, huge mosque.
The city has the largest number of Turks outside its homeland.
According to police, for security reasons, a 25-thousand crowd gathered in front of the temple was blocked, but supporters of the president gathered in the area to see their leader.
Hundreds of Erdogan’s opponents, including many Kurds, have also decided to express their opinion, condemning Turkey’s leader’s policy and the German government’s decision to adopt politics in the country.
Opposite protests reflect the divisions sparked by the political visit of some of the Turks living in Germany and recognized as autocratic by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist killed in car collision
A cyclist died after colliding with a car in London.
The crash occurred near the crowded intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street in Deptford, the southeastern part of the city, around 10:15 BST.
After the incident, the driver stopped the vehicle, and the medical ambulances arrived. Despite the intervention, the man died at the scene of the accident.
A few months ago, another fatal accident involving a cyclist occurred on Childers Street (about a mile and a half away from the scene of the accident on Saturday), and the driver fled the scene.
The Metropolitan Police said officials were working on identifying the deceased man and informing the family members of the incident.
Roads were closed and bus tours were organized, and drivers were advised to avoid the nearby area.
Long Lartin Penalty: Six Officials Injured as a result of Confusion
According to the agency’s authorities, six officials were injured as a result of disturbances in a men’s prison with an increased level of safety.
The raids at the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire began on Sunday around 9:30 British time (BST) and are still ongoing.
Eight inmates in one of the wing units of the facility were called for a specialty unit "Tornado".
Officials who were on the spot suffered minor facial injuries.
The company’s spokesman said: “Specially trained personnel were involved in the action at HMP Long Lartin.
Six of the staff members suffered minor injuries.
We do not tolerate violence at our premises. We are convinced that the responsible persons will be handed over to the police and can spend more time in prison."
HMP Long Lartin is home to more than 500 prisoners, including one of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
According to reports in June, the director of the facility had to go to the hospital after being attacked by one of the prisoners.
In October last year, preventive teams were called to the facility due to dangerous interference, during which employees were attacked with bullets to play billiards.
Hurricane Rosa floods threaten Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (possibly beneficial effects on drought areas)
It is rare that tropical depression reaches the state of Arizona. It is likely to do so at the beginning of next week. Remains after Hurricane Rosa move through desert areas of the Southwest, creating a threat of emergency
The National Weather Service has issued a warning about the possibility of flooding on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including cities such as City, Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Las Vegas.
According to the forecast on Tuesday, Rosa will pass directly over Phoenix. On Monday afternoon, the rain will begin.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix reported on Twitter that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained a storm or tropical depression at a distance of 320 km from Phoenix.
Hurricane Katrina (in 1967) approached a distance of 65 km from the Arizona state border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict precipitation from 5 to 10 cm in height. In some areas of Mogollon Rim in Arizona can reach up to 15 cm in height.
In the rest of the desert areas of the Southwest – including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Falls – the rainfall is likely to range from 2.5 to 5 cm, and in some areas up to 10 cm.
For people outside areas at risk of sudden flooding, the rains accompanying Hurricane Rosa can bring relief as the region has been struggling with drought for some time.
Although the floods pose a serious threat, some of the rainfall will improve the situation in the Southwest, where droughts prevail.
According to the weather.com portal, the U.S. Drought Monitor estimates that nearly 40% of the Arizona area is struggling with severe droughts that fall into the second-highest category.
Hurricane Rosa arrives first on the California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa continued to move with hurricane force, reaching speeds of up to 137 km/h. It is now 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and heading north at 19 km/h.
Hurricane encounters the cooler waters of the Pacific Ocean, causing it to weaken.
According to the forecast, it will hit Mexico with a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Intensive rainfall in some parts of Mexico can pose a high risk of flooding.
The weather.com portal reported that "in the area from the California Peninsula to the northwestern part of the state of Sonora it is expected to rain at an altitude of 7 to 15 cm, though it can reach 25 cm."
Then Hurricane Rosa will pass through Mexico in the northern direction in the form of a tropical storm. On Tuesday, early in the morning, it will reach the Arizona state border as a tropical depression. By Tuesday evening it will travel to the southern part of Utah state.
“The most serious threat posed by Hurricane Rosa or its remains is the very abundant rainfall on the California Peninsula, in the northwestern part of the state of Sonora and in the southwestern desert areas of the United States.”
According to rain forecasts, life-threatening sudden floods and the movement of pollution in the desert and muddy lawns in the mountainous area will result.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempting to Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on charges of attempting to assassinate a 16-year-old found with wounds in Somerset County.
The boy was found in Excelsior Terrace, in the village of Midsomer Norton, on Saturday, around 4:00 BST.
The victim was taken to the hospital, and her condition remains "stable".
According to police from Avon and Somerset, one seventeen-year-old, two eighteen-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested last night in the Radstock area.
Officials ask to contact all persons who have recordings of the event.
Trump Says Brett Kavanaugh “Recognized the Subtlety and Anger” of the Democratic Party
“The voice given to Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the absolute and offensive conduct of the Democratic Party,” Trump said in a speech in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “feeling the subtlety and anger” of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
On Thursday, Brett Kavanaugh testified before Congress, firmly and emotionally denying Christina Blasey Ford's allegations. The woman claims that decades ago, when both were teenagers, the man committed sexual assault against her.
Ford also testified at the hearing on the charges she had filed.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day, “Americans could be convinced of the brilliance, class and courage” of Kavanaugh.
“The voice given to Judge Kavanaugh is the voice of support for one of the most prominent lawyers of our time, a law expert with great merit for the community,” he said in front of a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president did not directly refer to Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination, discussing the importance of the Republicans’ frequency in the half-presidential election.
“We are divided by five of the most important choices in our lives.
I don’t start in these elections, but I remain very active,” he said.
"I'm always fighting to defend our great candidates."
Trump says Democrats are pursuing a policy of “supposing resistance and hampering activity.”
According to CNN, one of the Republican Party’s key policy assistants, the first key Senate vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected by Friday at the latest.
Hundreds of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia. The number of victims is growing
At least 384 people were killed, many of whom were abducted by high waves crashing into the beaches, as a result of a severe earthquake and tsunami that struck Indonesia’s island of Sulawesi.
On Friday in Palu, hundreds of people gathered on the beach to take part in the festival in the city. In the middle of the day, waves up to 6 meters high hit the shore, kidnapping many people and destroying everything along the way.
The tsunami was the result of a 7.5-degree earthquake.
“When a threat occurred yesterday, people on the beach did not flee immediately and fell victim to a tsunami,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s BNPD disaster agency, at a conference in Jakarta.
“The Tsunami attacked everything along its way, hijacking cars, bars and houses,” Nugroho said. Then he added that before reaching the coastline, he was moving at sea at a speed of 800 km/h.
As he said, some saved themselves by climbing trees and they managed to survive.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 resorts in Palu.
In the airplane photos published by the Agency for Natural Disasters, you can see many destroyed houses and shops, damaged and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was hit by secondary shocks.
In the area of 2.4 million people, there have been a series of earthquakes.
According to the Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Exploitation (BPPT), the energy released by the massive Friday earthquake was about two times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The statement stated that the geographical location of the city, which is located at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have exacerbated the effects of the tsunami.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said that hundreds of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were demolished.
He then added that the bodies of parts of the victims were found under demolished buildings, 540 people were injured, and 29 people were found missing.
Nugroho said the fatalities and damages could be greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, in the area called Donggala, which was near the epicenter of the earthquake.
According to Nugroh, the communication "has been completely paralysed", and there are no reports from the province of Donggala.
“There are more than 300,000 people living there” — reads the statement of the Red Cross. It was also added that the workers and volunteers of the organization go to places affected by the disaster.
“We can talk about a tragedy right now, although the situation may be deteriorating considerably,” the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency met with widespread criticism due to the lack of information about the tsunami in Palu. However, the authorities said the waves came immediately after the warning was issued.
On an amateur footage shared on social media, you see a man screaming from the building, trying to warn of the upcoming tsunami people on the street.
Within minutes, the water wall collapsed by the shore, hijacking buildings and cars.
Reuters has not been able to immediately confirm the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused significant shortages in the supply of electricity, preventing communication within Palu, which in turn made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate emergency responses.
According to the authorities, the military has begun sending transport aircraft with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, however, evacuees are still in great need of food and other basic first-hand items.
The airport in the city is open only for humanitarian assistance. The airport will remain inactive until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centres in Palu.
More than 800 tsunami victims in Indonesia.
The situation is very bad.
According to Doseba T. Sinai, the national director of World Vision, the organization’s staff arrived safely from the province of Donggala to the city of Palu and found shelter in the barn-shaped tents set up in the office yard.
“They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
The situation is very bad.
While some groups are slowly starting to bring aid, there have been criticisms that foreign humanitarian workers with rich experience have been prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, the acceptance of funding, resources and staff from abroad can only begin after the announcement of the site of the disaster as a national disaster area.
This hasn't been done yet.
“Officially, we are still dealing with a regional disaster,” a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross said.
“When the government recognizes that there has been a national disaster, we will be able to start accepting international aid, but that has not happened yet.”
Two days after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and families of the missing still hope that their loved ones will somehow find themselves in the midst of the destruction.
A little boy was pulled out of the canals on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who spent two days in the graveyard next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, the Indonesian paratrooper's coach, has trained two missing paratroopers to participate in the Indonesian Asian Games this month.
As Petra Mandagi said, other people imprisoned in the Roa Roa hotel were his students.
“As an experienced paratrooper, I struggle with my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon Subandono said that within hours of the community’s emergence, paratroopers despaired to send messages about the Roa Roa hotel crash via a WhatsApp communicator to athletes participating in the beach festival.
His messages were marked with only one gray hook instead of a pair of blue hooks.
“It seems to me that this means that the messages have not been delivered,” he said.
Thieves stole <0x24>26,750 while replenishing cash at ATM at Newport on the Levee Mall
According to a Newport police command statement on Friday morning, thieves stole <0x24>26,750 from Brink’s employee, who was replenishing the cash at an ATM in Newport on the Levee shopping mall.
“The car driver emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to supplement the cash,” Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
Another man “runned from behind to a Brink employee” and stole a bag of money from the ATM.
According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not state how many people were involved in the theft.
All persons with information about the identity of the thief are requested to contact the Newport Police Command at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West has decided to change his name to Ye.
Announcing his intention on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote about himself: “A person formerly known as Kanye West.”
The forty-one-year-old musician has been using the pseudonym Ye for some time. It is also the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change occurred before the Saturday Night Live visit. During the performance, the artist is expected to present his new album for Yandhi.
He will replace Arianna Grande, who, according to the creators, has given up on “emotional reasons.”
West has previously stated that the word "Ye" is not only a shortcut of his current artistic nickname, but has a religious significance.
“It seems to me that ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible. In the Bible it means ‘You’,” West said earlier this year, discussing the title of the album with a radio presenter with the pseudonym Big Boy.
“So I’m you, I’m us, it’s about us.
At first I was Kanye, which means the only person. Now I am Ye – a reflection of all our good, bad, and misguided traits.
The album shows who we are.”
West found himself in a group of other famous rappers who decided to change their name.
Sean Combs, known under the pseudonyms Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, announced this year that he wanted to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, a former West colleague, also recorded his pseudonym in various ways, with a connector, without a connector and in capital letters.
Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador pledges not to use the military against civilians
On the eve of the 50th anniversary of the bloody suppression of the student demonstrations, Mexican president-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) pledged never to use the military against civilians.
On Saturday, at Three Cultures Square, López Obrador promised “never to use the military to repress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on the square towards a peaceful demonstration, killing as many as 300 people. The event occurred during a time when the left student movement began to develop throughout Latin America.
López Obrador promised to support young people in Mexico by providing monthly financial assistance to students, as well as by creating more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities for young people to criminal groups.
The United States Should Double Funding for Research on Artificial Intelligence
According to Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI expert working for Google, Microsoft and Apple, along with China’s increased activity in this area, the U.S. is expected to double spending on AI research.
The comment is related to the announcements on artificial intelligence published by various U.S. government agencies, although the U.S. does not have an official strategy on ISIS.
Meanwhile, last year, China presented its plan, according to which it wants to become the most innovative state in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
“First of all, we need to double the budget for SI research: all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are trying to make another breakthrough in this area,” said Kai-Fu Lee.
In an interview with CNBC this week, he also said that doubling the funds could double the chances of another breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence in the United States.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" (The Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order) was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, the publishing company of the newest, the newest, the newest, is the president of the company.
In the 1980s, Kai-Fu Lee worked at Carnegie Mellon University to create the SI system, which defeated the then best American player in the Othello game. He then held a leadership position in Microsoft Research and was the chairman of Google's Chinese division.
Lee acknowledged the success of the US government’s previous technological initiatives, e.g., the Advanced Research Projects Agency in the Defense Area (DARPA) competition for the most interesting robot projects. He also asked about the deadline for the next edition of the competitions.
As Kai-Fu Lee said, scientists in the United States often have to work hard to get government grants.
“It’s not China that welcomes us the best representatives of the academia, but corporations,” Lee said.
For several years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed outstanding scientists to work on artificial intelligence.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy could also help the United States in the development of IS.
“I believe that people who are engaged in artificial intelligence who have obtained a doctoral degree should automatically be awarded a green card,” he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council published a plan to create the next generation of artificial intelligence.
As noted by Lee, the National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding for members of academic institutions in a manner similar to the U.S. National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations granting funds to the U.S. academics.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (Joint Artificial Intelligence Center), which will engage in the work of partners from the world of industry and science. The White House has announced the creation of a special Intel Committee (the Intellic Artificial Intelligence Commission).
This month, DARPA also announced a <0x24>2 billion allocation for an AI Next initiative.
The National Science Foundation currently invests more than <0x24>100 billion a year in research on SI.
At the same time, the U.S. initiative to set up a National Commission on Artificial Intelligence Security has been one step ahead for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change their country's name
On Sunday, the Macedonians voted in a referendum to change their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, which would spark a decades-long dispute with Greece, which blocks the country's attempts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, in which the historical country of Macedonia is located, maintains that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim to its territory. Hence, it has prevented the country from joining the EU and NATO.
In June, the governments of the two countries reached an agreement on the naming, but nationalists claim that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority living in Macedonia.
President <0xC7><0xB4>orge Ivanov said he would not take part in the vote. The campaign to boycott raised doubts as to whether the frequency would reach the minimum level of 50% required to recognize the referendum as binding.
The referendum asked the following question: "Do you support joining NATO and the EU following the agreement with Greece?"
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, argue that it is worth paying the price for the possibility of Macedonia – one of the countries that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia – to organizations such as the European Union or NATO.
“I voted for the future of my country so that young Macedonians can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union. EU membership will ensure greater security for all of us,” said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska from Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have declared that they will respect the results of the vote.
The change of name requires the support of two-thirds of parliamentarians.
The State Electoral Commission said that no unusual events were recorded by 13:00 p.m.
However, the frequency at this time was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016. At the time, 66% of eligible voters voted.
“I voted because of my children. Our place is in Europe,” said 62-year-old <0xC7><0xB4>osze Tanewski, a Skopje voter.
On September 30, 2018 in the Macedonian town of Strumica, Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, his wife Zorica and son Duszko voted in a referendum on changing the country’s name to pave the way for membership in NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kawardarkov prepared a small stage and set up chairs in front of tents distributed by people boycotting the referendum.
“We support membership in NATO and the EU, but we want to join those organizations with the head untied, not the back door,” Kawardarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don’t want us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China or Russia, and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaew said NATO membership would bring the necessary investments to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20%.
“I believe the vast majority is in favour of a name change in the referendum because 80% of citizens support the European Union and NATO,” Zaew said after the vote.
He said the vote to "yes" was a "confirmation of our future."
In a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian public research institute from 30 to 43% of voters declared their desire to participate in the referendum. This is less than the required frequency.
According to another poll conducted by Macedonian television Telma TV in Sunday’s referendum, it plans to vote 57% of respondents.
70% of respondents said they would support the name change.
In order for the vote to be successful, the frequency must be 50% <0x2B> 1 vote.
Failure in the referendum would be the first major blow to the pro-Western government's policy since taking power in May last year.
Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero defeats Brighton and wins goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling sent home Brighton in a 2-0 match for Manchester City on Saturday. The match was played at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguera’s goal in 65 minutes looked childishly easy.
The action began with the shooting of an Argentine assailant in the middle of the camp.
The player overtook three defenders of Brighton.
Then Aguero was among the four Brighton players.
He first embraced one of them, then ran over the others and found himself on the edge of the Brighton Penal Field.
Then he played the ball to the left, where Sterling was waiting for her.
The English striker immediately handed the ball back to Aguera in the penal field, who defeated Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan by shooting on the right side of the goal.
"Aguero is fighting a foot injury," Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about the possibility of playing for 55, 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky that he had a goal at the time.”
However, it was Sterling who provided the blues with their first single in the Premier League.
The gate we were talking about fell in the 29th minute.
In the action of this Aguero got the ball deep in half of Brighton.
He sent a great presentation along the left side of the camp to Leroy Sane.
Sane made several moves, allowing Sterling to move to a distant pole.
Manchester City's attacker pointed the ball to the net just before it crashed into the car.
Manchester City will face Hoffenheim in the UEFA Champions League group stage on Tuesday at 12:55 pm. The match will take place at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to ruin his chances of winning the Rockies
After losing the chance to participate in the play-off phase by Washington Nationals Scherzer did not have to play in the first team.
However, Scherzer's lover is hoping to appear in a Sunday's game against the Colorado Rockies, if only the Rockies retain their chances of performing in the play-off phase. Currently the team has one more win than the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West division.
Rockies can count on at least a wild card if they win a Friday's match against the Nationals with a score of 5:2. However, they still want to win their first division championship.
“Although we’re playing ‘nothing’, at least we’ll go out on the field, knowing that the atmosphere in Denver and the performances of the opponents will be at the highest level as in the rest of the season.
Why wouldn’t I want to be in this meeting?”
The Nationals have not yet announced a start-up for the Sunday meeting, but the team is inclined to exhibit Scherzer in the first set.
It would be Scherzer's thirty-fourth performance in the first team. The player took part in Thursday's throw training and hopes to perform on Sunday.
The Washington team's right-handed goalkeeper scored 18-7 and ERA 2.53. He eliminated the batsmen 300 times and counted 220 and 2/3 rounds in the season.
So Trump in West Virginia.
Trump did not directly refer to his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court judge, discussing the importance of the Republican frequency in the half-presidential election.
“In November, we are putting all the achievements we have achieved so far.
From one of the most important choices in our lives, we are divided by five weeks.
Although I do not start, I remain very active. I keep defending our great candidates," he said.
He continued: “We are dealing with a terrible group of radical Democrats, and we see their actions on their own.
They are determined to take power by all means possible, they are deceptive and malicious.
They don't care who they hurt and who they have to hurt in order to gain power and control, and taking power and control is their goal, but we won't give it to them."
As he said, the Democrats are carrying out the mission of “refusing and hampering activities.”
“It has been very good to see in the last four days,” he said, calling Democrats “bad, malicious, unpleasant and untrue.”
The president referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, citing the name and surname of American Senator from the Democratic Party Dianne Feinstein, who met with a loud beating from the crowd.
“Do you remember her answer?
Are you responsible for the leakage of the document?
“Oh, I’m listening?
No... I mean... no." Her body language was fatal. It was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a group of people with different views.
The party is intolerant of people who express their opinions.
When the activists of Momentum in my party voted to give me a nagata, I was not surprised.
After all, I am a member of a group of Labour Members who have recently been told that they are not welcome, all because of their own opinions.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the application for the nagata was the result of a difference of opinions between me and Jeremy Corbyn.
The differences concerned the importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe. As for the irony of fate, Jeremy Corbyn opposed the position of previous leaders on these issues.
The announcement of a meeting of Labour MPs in Nottingham East said: “We want the meetings to be open and productive.”
During my eight years as a member of the Labour Party, most of the Friday afternoon meetings of the General Committee looked like this.
Unfortunately, many meetings are now taking place differently, and the promise of a "more cordial and gentler" policy has long been forgotten, as far as ever remembered.
It is increasingly obvious that the Labour Party does not tolerate differing views. Each opinion is assessed in terms of compatibility with the party leadership.
It all started shortly after the presidency of Jeremy Corbyn. Colleagues, who seemed to me to have similar views, began to expect from me a change of direction and occupy positions that I would not agree with in the past.
After every public speech – regardless of the content – I meet on social media with attacks calling for nominations, condemning centrism or leaving the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments addressed to me are rather political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who experience treatment in a sexist or racist way every day, but do not avoid further action.
One of the most disappointing aspects of the current policy is the transition to the agenda with insulting others.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should support a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer a group of people with different views. With every request for a “moment of distrust” and every change in the rules of choice, the party’s worldview is tightened.
Over the past two years, I have been repeatedly advised not to sneak up and sneak up on certain issues. Then everything “would be fine”.
But that’s not why I’ve been involved in politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student as a result of the government’s negligence that led to the disintegration of my school class, I strive to provide better public services for those in need – both as a local councillor and as a minister.
I never concealed my beliefs, even during the last election campaign.
Everyone in Nottingham East knew my position and knew about the differences of opinions with the party authorities.
I would like to say to the people who supported Friday’s proposal that I cannot understand the desire to waste time and energy on the question of my loyalty to the Labour president in the face of an imminent Brexit that will harm households and businesses.
The most important message, however, is not to the Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters (both Labour members and others): I am proud to be able to serve you. I promise that no threats of revocation of any of your nominations will work in any way, and no consensual interest of yours will not be reached.

Ayr vs Melrose 38:17 – unstoppable Ayr again
Two late matches may have been a bit overwhelming, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved a win in this incredibly interesting Scottish extra-league game.
The team was in the first place in the table and remains the only undefeated team.
In the end, this distinguished defense and better use of the opportunity led the host team to victory. Coach Peter Murchie was able to be satisfied with his caretakers.
"The matches so far have been a challenge for us, but we are still unbeaten, so I'm happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “We have to pay tribute to Ayr’s players, and they have taken advantage of the opportunities that come.”
Ayr went out to lead in the 14th minute after Grant Anderson's addition and the promotion of Frazier Clima. However, the yellow card for Rory Hughes's scotch, who came to the team from the Glasgow Warriors, allowed Melrose to use a drink on the slope of the slope.
Cilimo increased Ayr’s lead after he dropped from the penalty kick just before the end of the first half. He first won the appendix, and then took advantage of the opportunity to raise, getting a 17:5 score for Ayr.
Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's rise by Baggot reduced the loss to five points.
Then there was a longer suspension of the game due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott. The driver was removed from the field on the boots. After renewing Ayr increased the lead after the application of Stafford McDowall and the rise of Clima.
Next, team captain Ayr Blair Macpherson received a yellow card. Melrose re-used his number: adding an unused attempt to raise Bruce Colvin reduced leadership.
The hosts took the initiative when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for defeating Clima without a ball. MacPherson gained an appendage on the back of the approaching defense.
Climo took advantage of the chance to raise. Then again he managed to raise the score right after the game was resumed, when Kyle Rowe caught a shot from a penalty kick and allowed the wingman Gregory Henry to win a fifth place for the host.
Star of the Still Game series starts a career in the gastronomy industry
Ford Kieran, star of the Still Game series, seems to be starting up in the gastronomy industry. Recently it was discovered that he became the CEO of the restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC sitcom and co-creates the series together with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duet has announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last in the history of the series. Everything indicates that Ford Kiernan is already planning the future after leaving "Craiglang".
According to official data, he became the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on this, although Scottish Sun informant suggested that Kiernan was trying to engage in a “growing gastronomic industry” in Glasgow.
“The sea belongs to us”: Bolivia’s lack of access to the sea gives hope that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific
Marines patrol the area of the naval base in La Paz.
From the public buildings are blue flags.
In the ports of the navy from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon there is the following motto: “The sea is our law.
It is our duty to recover it.”
In the inaccessible Bolivian sea, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in the bloody 19th-century resource conflict is still alive. Absolutely like a dream of re-shipping the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the greatest in a few decades. Bolivia awaits a judgment of the International Court of Justice. It is to be issued on October 1 after a five-year trial.
“Bolivia’s actions are taking a break. The residents are unanimous, optimistic and count on a favourable verdict,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians across the country will watch together the meeting of the International Court of Justice. They hope that the organization based in The Hague will recognize the claim of Bolivia and after decades of unsuccessful talks, Chile will not have to join the deadly state in the absence of a state.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia, who will be in a controversy over re-election next year, also hopes for Monday’s ruling.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he vowed at the end of August.
However, some analysts argue that the chances of a favorable decision for Bolivia are small and that even a favourable decision would not change much.
The United Nations body based in The Hague has no authority to grant Bolivia the territory of Chile. It also warned that it will not affect the conclusion of any talks.
According to Paz Zárate, a Chilean specialist in international law, the decision of the International Court of Justice will be issued six months after the submission of the final arguments. Such a short time shows that the case was “not complicated”.
Unfortunately, Bolivia has been able to keep the country away from its target for the past four years.
“The question of access to the sea has been isolated by the current Bolivian administration,” said Paz Zárate.
The relentless rhetoric Morales deprived the Chileans of any remnant of goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume talks at some point, but it will be very difficult in the face of the current situation.
There has been no exchange of ambassadors for both countries since 1962.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltsé, former president and representative of Bolivia in The Hague, disagreed with the view that the court’s decision process was extremely fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring a “exceptional opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile” and the possibility of “ending a 139-year period of mutually beneficial disputes,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales — still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents — used the topic of access to the sea as an element of political play.
“Bolivia will never give up the right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The decision is a great opportunity to convince ourselves that we have to deal with the past.”
North Korea’s cruisers say nuclear disarmament will not take place until they can trust the United States.
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his people will never get rid of nuclear weapons until he can trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep its promises during the Singapore summit between the leaders of both countries.
His comments came at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of resumption of suspended nuclear diplomacy more than three months after a meeting in Singapore with North Korea’s leader, Kim Une Jong-un.
Ri argues that it is as if the lack of lifting of sanctions and the opposition of the United States to the declaration ending the Korean war has ever thrown North Korea on its knees.
Washington does not want to agree to sign a declaration without Pyongyang taking concrete disarmament measures.
Both Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump want another meeting.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is seriously approaching the elimination of arsenal, which is seen in North Korea as the only means of ensuring security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month in preparation for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Fashion shows in Paris are sparking the emergence of the latest line of great headdresses in clothing stores.
If you want to enlarge your collection of hats or completely cover yourself in the sun, then we have good information for you.
Valentino and Thom Browne fashion designers presented a series of insane, over-the-counter heads covering their 2019 summer collection that shined in style during Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats climbed on Instagram this summer. The aforementioned designers decided to present their stunning creations on the run.
The distinguishing work of Valentino was a huge beige hat decorated with a wide, feathered rounding that watered the models’ heads.
Other oversized accessories included arbustes decorated with jewelry, a wizard’s hat, and even pineapple — they weren’t designed, however, to warm the head.
Thom Browne also showed a number of special masks — at the same time for Halloween.
Many colored masks had a seamless mouth and resembled more the style of Hannibal Lecter than the Haute Couture.
One creation resembled diving equipment with tubes and glasses, and the other looked like melted ice.
And if you don't want to go out with great fashion, you're lucky.
Observers of styles predict that huge hats can reach out to clothing stores.
The infinite hats follow right behind "La Bomba", a slender hat with a 61 cm wide round hat that everyone has already worn — from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind this extremely impractical hat, which slipped through social media, presented on the run another great creation — a muddy beach bag almost as large as a model wearing it in a bathing suit.
A flaming orange rafia bag, finished with rafia straps and finished with a white leather handle, stood out in the Jacquemus La Riviera collection for the summer season 2019 during Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage, star stylist, said FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags to appear in stores next summer — because the designer managed to make such a big impact, it would be hard not to take advantage of the demand for academia.”
John Edward: Language Skills Necessary for the Citizens of the World
Independent schools in Scotland are constantly enjoying their scientific achievements — in 2018, they were able to boast of other outstanding exam results, supportive individual and collective successes in sports, arts, music and other pre-conceptions.
The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) schools, which attend more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, aim to provide the best level of services to students and parents.
The aim of independent schools is to prepare students for further and higher education, the career path they choose, and to point out their role as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector with the ability to develop and implement a curriculum tailored to the needs of the school, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable subjects to choose from in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to another person in a language that understands, then it comes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it gets to his heart.”
It is a clear reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The results of the last exam this year show that languages are ranked first in the league rankings, with the highest rates of feasibility occurring in the case of independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages received a higher A score.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 per cent of students had a higher A score in Mandarin, and 72 per cent of German learners, 69 per cent of French learners and 63 per cent of Spanish learners also had an A score.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as the necessary skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, learning languages, as subjects to choose from, is conducted in the same scope as learning STEM subjects (strict science, technology, engineering and mathematics) within curricula in independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17 per cent of the applicants’ language skills were inadequate due to difficulties in job vacancies by employers.
Therefore, more and more language skills are becoming a necessity allowing young people to prepare for the start of a career.
These skills are essential in a globalized world with a growing number of jobs requiring language proficiency,
A lifelong skill, such as learning a second language, will provide a huge advantage in the future —regardless of the defensive career path.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically increases the chances of a multilingual person in relation to competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey, which included more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75% of them were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language, with 1 percent of the people using tjf.
That’s why investing in teaching foreign languages is so important for today’s children.
Knowledge of several languages, in particular the languages of developing economies, will give children more chances of finding a suitable job.
In Scotland, each school will be different in terms of the languages taught in it.
Many schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages recognized as the most important for the UK in the 2020s, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of the child, in independent schools there will always be a lot of languages to choose from, which will be taught by specialized teaching staff in this area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to be successful – regardless of what the future holds for them.
Currently, it cannot be denied that in the international business environment, languages are still crucial to the future of the country, and so this must be reflected in education.
Contemporary languages should be treated as “international communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer Scottish youth a great choice, diversity and level.
That's just what it should be.
John Edward, President of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron's debut at the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
Fans who want to see LeBron James’s debut at the Los Angeles Lakers have finally arrived.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that LeBron James will play a Sunday pre-season game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It is not yet known how many minutes he will play.
"More than one, but less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers team's official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said on Twitter that James is likely to play a few minutes.
After training that took place earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-season games for the Lakers.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need to take part in pre-season games to get ready,” he said.
So Trump's election in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of election nights tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It’s the first of Trump’s five election nights to be held next week, along with stances in friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
Along with a vote affirming the suspension of his election to a vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump seeks to build support in the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans may be threatened with losing control of Congress when the ballots are cast.
What time will Trump’s election in West Virginia take place tonight, and where will he be viewed online?
So the Trump election in Wheeling, West Virginia will take place today at 7 p.m., i.e. on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
So Trump’s election in West Virginia will be able to be watched live on the Internet on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on this week’s interviews with the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who took place in a tense atmosphere in connection with allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct by the time of his arrest, as well as his premeditation.
The main goal of this series of election evenings, however, is to provide support to Republicans facing difficult November elections.
So President Trump’s five-century campaign next week aims to “mobilize volunteers and supporters to help Republicans protect and expand the majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives.”
“Congress control is such an important point in the president’s schedule that as the hottest campaign season approaches, he will visit as many states as possible,” Trump’s campaign spokesman said in a statement.
Today’s election at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling may attract supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media attention from Pittsburgh” — West Virginia Metro News.
Trump will visit West Virginia on Saturday, a state in which he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016, for the second time in the last month.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Senate candidate, Republican Patrick Morris, who loses in polls.
“This is not a good sign for Morrisey when the president comes to support him in polls,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. Team Shows the Spirit of Fight, Keeping Hope for Victory in Sunday Singles
After three unilateral sessions, the foursome format held on Saturday afternoon could be what the Ryder Cup needed.
The rolling slope of the race is a completely invented sporting concept, but one in which the athletes really believe, and most of all in competitions like this one.
So, what's their shift at this point?
“They’ve been driving six points, and now they’re only driving four, so I think we’ve got a little kick-off,” said Jordan Spieth.
Europe, of course, leads by four points, while there are twelve more to win.
However, Americans, as Spieth says, feel the wind in the sails and have decent patterns to imitate, especially in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together throughout the day and each of them could boast of winning three out of four points.
Spieth is dangerous in all areas and gives an example.
The screams around his throat as a sign of excitement became louder during his round, drowning the key putt and winning the match when he and Thomas won two holes in two strokes.
His reflection on the ground, which gave them a victory with a score of 15, was met with a similar scream — one that makes it clear that the American team is still in the game.
"You just need to focus and worry about your own game," Spieth said.
That's all that's left for each of these players.
Eighteen dolls to win.
The only players who have scored more points in the last two days than Spieth and Thomas were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable history of the Ryder Cup.
A strange but charming pair of European teams won four out of four and was not mistaken.
"Moliwood" is the only couple that did not count the bogeys on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
The way the game plays and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the noisy crowd proves that you have to beat these players on Sunday, as well as that there is no better player than Fleetwood or Molinari who could seal the potential victory of the National Golf team in Europe.
It would be best if they played at different levels at the same time.
However, it is too early to talk about the victory of the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly played Sergio Garcia, a morning fourball hero when he was shot with Alex Noren.
Bogey and the double double on the front nine dug the Spaniards and Sweden into a hole they would never get out of.
There's no one on Sunday who can help me get out of the hole.
The fourball and foursome formats are so fascinating due to the interactions between couples, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and how a change in strategy can occur at one time.
Europe has played better so far as a team and took a significant lead on the last day, but the foursome session also showed that the US team has a clash in which some, especially in the US, doubted.
Europe with a score of 10-6 includes driving on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe with a significant advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after winning 10-6 Saturday fourball and foursome games with the United States.
The inspired duo—Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari—assumed the scrap, bringing two victories over fighting Tiger Woods, increasing his score at Le Golf National to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, trying to keep the trophy that he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a non-tariff American team in the morning fourball format, winning the series with a score of 3-1.
The United States made more resistance in the foursome format, winning two matches, but could not make a loss.
In order to keep the trophy, Jim Furyka’s team must score eight points out of 12 singles that will take place on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to score four points in a row, while together with Molinarim (the team was named "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend) they are only the second pair in the history of the Ryder Cup to score four points in four quarters.
After Woods and Patrick Reed crashed into a great fourball format, they defeated Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau, earning an even more empathetic score of 5&4.
Woods, who was tired of two Saturday matches, occasionally showed a brilliant genius, but has so far lost 19 of 29 matches in fourball and foursome formats, and that's seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not take part in the morning fourball format, returned to Henrik Stenson in the foursome format to beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka with a 2&1 score — ranked 1 and 3 respectively in the world rankings.
The European team, however, did not think everything was going on in this pleasant, cool day on the field to the southwest of Paris.
The three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a benchmark for the Americans, earning two points on Saturday.
They won a decisive victory with a score of 2&1 over the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourball format and later returned to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with a score of 4&3 in the foursome format, losing two opening docks.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup did the team make a four-point loss, starting the singles, though Furyka would only have a draw to keep the trophy.
However, taking second place two days ago, a Sunday contract seems to be rather unlikely.
North Korea says “state no” to unilateral disarmament without trust.
North Korea’s foreign minister said in a speech at the UN on Saturday that the lack of lifting sanctions only deepens North Korea’s lack of trust in the United States and there is no reason for that country to unilaterally give up nuclear weapons in such nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual General Assembly that North Korea took “significant goodwill measures” last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear testing sites, and a commitment to non-proliferation and technology.
“But we don’t see any concrete response from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no guarantee of our national security, and in such circumstances there will be no talk of unilateral disarmament of North Korea.”
While Ri repeated North Korean remarks about Washington’s reluctance to take a “stage” approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea would be rewarded for its gradual take of action, his statement did not appear to be unanimous.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit in history between the US president and the leader of North Korea, which took place on June 12, Trump's Probability Day in Singapore, when Kim Jong-un was working on the “King of the Worlds”
North Korea expected a formal end to the Korean War (late 1950–1953), but the U.S. delegation announced that Pyongyang must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington has also supported calls to alleviate harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'denuclearization in the first place' and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive manner, even opposing the signing of 'the declaration of an end to the war'," Ri said.
“The statement that sanctions can throw us on our knees is a bunch of people who behave in a way that is ignorant of us.
The problem, however, is that the lack of lifting sanctions deepens our distrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, which the U.S. leader discussed earlier this week at the UN forum.
Instead, the minister drew attention to the three meetings between Kim Jong Un and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, after which he added: “If the denuclearization side of the denuclearization side were a non-South Korean impasse and a non-South Korean impasse.”
In my opinion, the tone of Ri's speech was completely different from last year when he said at the UN General Assembly that the deployment of North Korea's missiles on the territory of the United States is unavoidable after the "Mr. Evil Man on the Missile" by Mr. Trump.
This year, at the UN forum, Trump, who threatened last year to “complete destruction” of North Korea, praised Kim Jong Un for his courage to take steps in favor of disarmament, but also said there was still a lot of work to be done.
Trump said on Wednesday that he had not set a time frame for this, saying: “Whether it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday at a UN Security Council forum: “The enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must continue and be constant until we establish a full, final and verified denuclearization.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea, trying to suppress the funding of the Pyongyang nuclear program and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly forum and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month as part of preparations for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit cannot be called a success.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made, after which North Korea condemned him within a few hours for “putting gangster demands.”
North Korea pledged this month at a meeting with Moon Jae-in to dismantle the missile test site and the nuclear complex if the United States takes “appropriate measures.”
He said Kim Jong Un told him that the “appropriate means” he cares about are security guarantees that Trump has pledged in Singapore, and taking steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend a course on the subject of sufficiently long rest.
A new course at Harvard University, which took place this year, provided all students with more sleep, which was aimed at combating the growing culture of macho, which consisted of learning by “overnight caffeine-driven students.”
Academic students from the best university in the world often have no idea of the basics of caring for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a course that he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to create the course by a speech on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end of the speech, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why is this telling me only now that I’m in my last year of study?’
She said that no one ever told her about the meaning of sleep, which surprised me,” The Telegraph said.
During the course, which took place for the first time this year, it is explained to students how good sleep-related habits help achieve good results in learning and sports, as well as improving the overall well-being of students.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University Health Service, said that this course was decided to be introduced after it was found that students suffered from severe lack of sleep within a week.
The hourly course covers a number of interactive tasks.
One section includes a picture of a room in an academy where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, exercise and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deficiency affects sports outcomes, as well as how important it is to maintain regular sleep.
In another section, participants learn how long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to reflect on their daily routines.
“We know that this will not immediately change the behavior of the students.
But we believe that they have the right to know — just as everyone has the right to know what the health effects of smoking cigarettes bring with them,” added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride from “overnight learning” still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students means a growing problem of lack of sleep.
Ensuring enough sleep with good quality should be a “secret weapon” for students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, and even to avoid gaining weight, because lack of sleep causes the brain to go into hunger after the student is hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Ceisler develop a course after taking part in one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to press on to introduce the course for the entire campus.
The next step, according to him, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before switching to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set an alarm to remind when to go to sleep and when to get up, as well as to be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic devices screens and LED lighting, which can distract you from the problem.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga manages Gerrard's team
The Rangers again suffered during a fight at Livingston when Dolly Menga with his shot led to the defeat of dismantled team Steven Gerrard, earning a 1-0 score.
The team from Ibrox Stadium wanted to record their first victory since the February 4–1 victory over St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerrard for the second time in 18 games, making his team a difference of eight points in Premier's Hedgehog Hedgehog.
Menga scored the goal seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the Rangers' lack of involvement did not seem to improve.
While the Rangers saw a drop to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third — just behind the Hibernian with the loss of one goal.
The Rangers team may have another problem with the need to provide for Calum Spence's head wound after he was hit by an item thrown from the guest drum.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which allowed him to go ahead of Ayr and go to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, in turn, went through with the same eleven Livingston who scored the Hearts team last week, being an enthusiasm for the way his well-trained team tortured his opponents at every step.
The Rangers may have dominated possession of the ball, but the Livingston team did more with the ball once they got it.
They should have scored in just two minutes, when the first appearance of the ball by Menga allowed Scott Pittman to face the goal of Allan McGregor, but the aide did not take advantage of his chance.
Keaghan Jacobs then directed a deep free throw to Captain Craig Halkett, but his colleague Alan Lithgow, who played as a defender, could only remain in the rear position.
The Rangers regained control in the third quadrant, but it looked as if they had more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly admitted that he was due a penalty of fifteen minutes before the end of the game, when he and Steven Lawless fell on each other, but Judge Steven Thomson solved the Colombian claim.
The Rangers managed to deliver only two customs shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, barely worried about Lassana Coulibaly's head and a weak shot of Ovie's Ejaria.
While Livingston’s 34-minute goal-opening match could have been the opposite of a run-through game, no one can deny that they deserved it for the effort made to win it.
Again, the Rangers failed to cope with the deep-rooted fragment of Jacobs’ game.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher threw the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept the peace, giving it to Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard did not pause and traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent — this shift almost immediately affected the wingman who threw the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly managed to block it by getting out of his position.
The Livingston team continued to draw the guests to the game exactly as they liked it when Lithgow and Halkett performed long summits one after the other.
Holt's team could have increased the lead in the last few minutes, but McGregor was well ahead of Jacobs, after which Lithgow removed the game from the corner.
The Rangers' reserve, Glenn Middleton, had once again hoped for a penalty when he merged with Jacobs, but Thomson turned his eyes again.
Almanac: the inventor of Geiger's counter
And now the page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882 — 136 years ago... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, which ultimately led to the formation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has become an element of both science and pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" in which you appear unlikely cowboy-scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
The man said, “What the hell is that?”
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter that is used to locate radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you set up these headphones, you’ll hear the effects of atoms emitted by radioactive minerals.”
Evans: “Now you hear something!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name has survived to this day.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “observe” enemy cells.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Your Immune System to “Observe” Enemy Cells and Destroy them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize enemy cells as part of treatment.
This method consists of separating immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory.
Then they can "observe" the proteins common to many cancers, and then they are re-injected into the body.
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancers.
One woman who was treated with the vaccine, who learned to recognize the immune system, had ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method is to segregate immune cells from the patient, change them in the laboratory so that they can “observe” a protein common to many cancers called HER2, and then re-inject these cells into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland said: “Our findings indicate that this vaccine works very well.”
HER2 “encourages the growth of several types of cancers”, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancers, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach, consisting of retrieving immune cells from patients and “learning” their cancer cell locating, worked in the treatment of a certain type of leukaemia.
Kanye West goes on a pro-Trump diarrhea on Saturday Night Live with a MAGA hat on her head.
It didn't go very well.
Kanye West has been “exploded” at the studio during Saturday Night Live after praising U.S. President Donald Trump and saying he will run for office in 2020.
After performing his third song titled Ghost Town that night, during which he had an established hat with the inscription "Make America Great", he filed a lawsuit against the Democrats and re-expressed his support for Trump.
“Every time I talk to white people, I hear, ‘How can you like Trump? It’s racist!’
If I were concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL program began with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judicial Commission on allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it wasn't broadcast, West's footage was sent to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not known whether Rock wanted to laugh at West by posting a post.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had problems with his hat behind the scenes.
“They took me behind the scenes.
They told me not to go out with that hat on my head.
They took care of me!
And then they say I have no way out," he said — Washington Examiner.
West continued, “You say I have no way out?”, adding, “I’m going to set up a superman game so you won’t be able to tell me what to do.
Let's accept."
His words twice sparked a “waking up” of the audience, and the members of the SNL team looked confused — reports Variety. The person in the study during these events: “The grave silence prevailed in the study.”
West was invited to the show in place of Arianna Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West intrigued many with the performance of I Love It in Perrier's water bottle.
West received support from TPUSA Conservative Group boss Candace Turner, who posted the following tweet: “To one of the most courageous: THANK YOU FOR STAYING MAFIA.”
Speaking on the talk show, Karen Hunter said on Twitter that West was simply “self and it’s absolutely great.”
“But I will NOT reward people (by buying their music or clothes or by supporting their ‘study’) who I think accepts and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
We are also free,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and that he is now "formally named Kanye West".
However, he is not the first artist to change his name — following the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Friendly rapper, Snoop Dogg, adopted the name Snoop Lion, and music legend, Prince, changed the name to a symbol, then the artist known earlier as Prince.
Attempted murder in Belfast restaurant with a knife stabbed
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after he stabbed a man with a knife in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The defendant is expected to appear in court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the prosecutor.
Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington raises the issue of toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jonah Snow in the medieval HBO series Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor hit the stereotype of the hero macho, saying that showing such roles on the screen causes young boys to often think they have to play hard to be respected.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that "something went wrong" and wondered how to cope with the toxic <0x23>MeToo male problem.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones partner, 31-year-old actress Rose Leslie, has admitted that she feels "pretty sure" about the issue.
“Personally, I feel pretty sure at this point—where did we make a mistake on the topic of masculinity?” he said.
“What did we teach men as they grew up, looking at the problem we’re dealing with right now?”
Kit believes that the development of toxic masculinity can be partly responsible for television due to the representation of very male characters.
He continued: “What attitudes are born, and what are taught?
What do you learn on television and on the streets, what makes young boys start to think that they have to stand on a certain side to be a man?
I think this is one of the most important issues of our time — what can you do to change that?
Clearly, it is not all right with the young men.”
He also admitted in the interview that he will no longer play in any prequel or sequel of Game of Thrones after the series ends next year, saying that he "has finished with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will play Sam Shepard’s “True West,” which is the story of the filmmaker and his brother the thief.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks getting to know his wife Rose is the best thing that happened to him in Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife on the plane, which provided me with my future family and a new life,” he said.
In this award-winning Emmy series of fantasy, Rose played Ygritte — the object of love interest of the character of the branch by Kita, Jonah Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 on the territory of Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China has seen a 14 percent increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 percent increase in the number of people living with HIV and suffering from AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by this problem, according to health workers in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases have been sexually transmitted, which means a change in relation to the past.
Traditionally, the HIV virus spreads rapidly in some parts of China as a result of a transfusion of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been almost completely reduced, according to Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year to year, the number of people living with HIV and suffering from AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV by sex is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Given the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men having sex with men will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of transmission of the disease are due to insufficient protection when having sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has provided widespread access to HIV medicines as part of its efforts to combat the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that one of her team members disclosed data from Republican senators—it’s “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theory.”
A member of the U.S. House of Representatives, Maxine Waters, on Saturday dismissed allegations that a member of her team had posted personal data of three Republican senators on Wikipedia's websites.
A member of the Los Angeles Democratic Party said the allegations were made by experts and websites linked to “right-wing extremists.”
“Lies, lies, and even more nasty lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information reportedly contained the home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from Utah.
The information was posted on the Internet on Thursday by an unknown person in the Capitol during a panel hearing in the Senate on allegations of sexual abuse directed against nominee to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The escape took place some time after Kavanaugh’s candidacy was questioned by three senators.
Conservative parties, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was linked to the Waters cabinet and published information about a Waters team member, Hill said.
“This unsubstantiated allegation is completely false and is a 100 percent lie,” Waters said.
“A member of my team — whose identity, personal data and security have been violated as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations — was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
“This unsubstantiated allegation is completely false and is a 100 percent lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly sparked criticism on the Internet, including from Ari Fleischer, a former White House spokesman.
“This way of denying is bad,” Fleischer wrote.
“It suggests that she doesn’t have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven't done, they can't be bad.
He can't provoke.
It may not question the motives of the defendant.
He has to keep the peace.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism at the address of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of exaggerating anger during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running in mid-term elections to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"It's a terrible thing, if it's true," he tweeted.
In a statement, Waters said that her cabinet had notified “the competent authorities and prosecution authorities of these fraudulent allegations.”
“The perpetrators will be unmasked and legally held accountable for all their actions that pose a threat to any member of my team,” she said.
Johnny English: Nokaut: The Spy Parody with the Weaken Rowan Atkinson
The search for references to Brexit in every new British-themed film has become the norm. It seems to apply to the new part of the series of films of the genre of action and comedy "Johnny English", which began in 2003 from the film "Johnny English" and which returned to the English genre.
Will the self-sacrificing satirist about how hopeless we are become the new goods of the exporting country?
In any case, eternally surprised, characterised by a rubber face, incompetent Johnny English was again licensed to share — his name and name more than anything else signals that he is an expanded, comic work intended for non-English viewers.
He is, of course, a silly secret agent who, despite his strange tastes for smoothie glamour, has a little bit of Inspector Clouseau, a crab from Jas Besoli and a drop from this guy who adds one note to the 2012 melody of the lead song in the Olimonijski Otttori of Firiots.
In the past, he was also a traveler and a world-secret man — Atkinson once played in Barclaycard’s previously forgotten television commercials, where he left chaos behind.
In the latest Johnny English series, one or two moments are worth noting.
I really liked the scene in which Johnny English approached the helicopter, dressed in a medieval weapon, while his helmet was rhythmically hit by the windshields.
Atkinson's gift to physically play comedy is clearly visible on the screen, but the sense of humor seems to be quite low flights and unnecessary, especially since currently also "serious" film brands, such as 007 and Mission Impossible, offer comedy elements as a comic book.
The humorous elements seem to be aimed at children rather than adults — I don’t think Johnny English’s crazy adventures are as ingenious and coherent as the gays in Atkinson’s movies about Jason Beasley.
The current assumption has always been that the UK is having serious problems.
Cyberhacker infiltrates the UK’s super-secret network of spies, revealing the identity of all British agents operating in the area — to intimidate the agent at the service, Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately played a small role.
This is the last drop in the bitter witches of the prime minister, who is a pompous, wasteful character already suffering as a result of a nervous breakdown caused by a lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson does everything in her power, embodied in the character of Theresa May.
Her advisers to the intelligence agency inform her that, due to the disclosure of the identity of all active spies, she will have to return to the service of one of the retired agents.
And that means Johnny English's inability in his own person, currently employed as a teacher at some stylish school, giving unofficial lessons on how to become a secret agent — a few bad gags while giving English spying lessons.
English is summoned to Whitehall for a trip, reconnecting with his former assistant Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man associated with the captain of the submarine — a happy but somewhat tired character played by Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin take part in the secret service of Her Royal Majesty return to action, meeting the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletov, a character played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously tormented by a charismatic billionaire tech-maniac who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems — he is the villain Jason Volta, a branch of Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their crusade of absurdity: dresses for waiters light up a French restaurant; they enter chaos by smuggling on board the luxury yacht Volty; and English networks desolation while using the set to virtual reality.
In this last sequence, all limitations disappear, but despite the nice and hurried performance, the entire film is very similar to children’s television.
It's a typical average.
Like other Johnny English movies, I couldn’t resist the thought: can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that would really match his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is developing a plan that provides for British people a four-day week of work for which they will be paid in five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering introducing a radical plan under which the British will work four days a week, receiving a pay for five days.
The party allegedly wants the heads of companies to pass on to employees the savings gained by the revolution related to the development of artificial intelligence (AI), giving them an extra day off.
Thanks to this, employees could enjoy a three-day weekend, earning the same amount of pay.
Sources say that the idea will “be included” in the party’s economic agenda and plans to leave the country against workers.
The transition to a four-day week of work was supported by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way to benefit workers to change the economy.
A senior Labour Party member said in an interview with The Sunday Times: “A policy change is expected to be announced by the end of this year.”
“It will not happen from day to day, but a four-day week of work is something that fits into the party’s approach to restoring the economic balance for the benefit of the worker, as well as in the general industrial strategy of the party.
The Labour Party is not the first party to support such an idea — the Green Party committed to introducing a four-day week of work during the 2017 election campaign.
Currently, however, these plans are not supported by all Labour Party members.
The Labour Party spokesman said: “The four-day week of work is not a policy of the party and its introduction is not considered by it.”
John McDonnell, Chancellor of the shadow cabinet, used last week’s Labour conference to present his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from “faceless directors” and “speculators” in public utility companies.
The Chancellor’s plans from the shadow cabinet also mean that current shareholders of water companies may not recover their full share because the Labour government could make “accounts” based on detected abuses.
He also confirmed plans to place employees in corporate boards and create integration funds to transfer 10 percent of the company’s equity from the private sector to employees who receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy respond to a 60-minute question about whether the FBI’s investigation into Kavanaugh could make them change their attitude.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week and has raised the question of whether the findings of the prosecutor's office may have led to Republican disapproval.
In a 60-minute interview on Sunday, Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out anything that could lead to a change in their attitude.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“Of course,” said Kennedy.
“When I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after what happened when the allegation came up, and I said, "Did you do that?"
He was firm, determined and unambiguous.”
However, Graham’s opinion seems to be made in stone.
“I have made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh and to change it needs a strong allegation,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett has firmly denied this," Graham said, addressing Christine Blasey Ford.
“None of the people he gives could verify that.
It's been 36 years.
I don't think anything will change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it contributed to the reduction of poverty?
Next Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York, an annual musical event that boasts the incredibly impressive composition of emerging stars and the equally impressive mission of eradicating poverty in the world.
The 7th Global Citizen Festival will visit tens of thousands of people who come to the Great Lawn in Central Park to not only enjoy the performances of stars like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to support the realization of the most important goal of the event.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international group of activists to fight poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for this event (unless you decide to buy a VIP ticket), the participants of the concert had to perform a number of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to the world leader, performing a phone call or other important tasks.
But what successes can Global Citizen boast in the prospect of the remaining 12 years to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to convince them to require action, or is it another case of so-called “clickivism” when people feel they are doing something important by signing an online petition or posting a post on Twitter?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, more than 19 million “actions” have been recorded by people supporting the action, aiming to achieve many different goals.
It also says these actions have helped encourage global leaders to announce commitments and regulations worth more than <0x24>37 billion, which are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group outlined 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its activities, in which at least <0x24>10 billion has already been paid off or financed.
The Group estimates that the safeguarded measures have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK partnership of investors and filmmakers involved in “helping children to reach their full potential,” which promised to give Rwanda <0x24>35 million in tweezers, including <0x24>4 million in aid to eradicate global poverty.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and members of Global Citizen like you, we can make the social injustice that is malnutrition go to history.” — Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of Power of Nutrition in Lonniet, 2018
The group also said that after carrying out more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve the quality of food for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional problems.
One of the most frequently asked questions on their website was, “How can you be sure that extreme poverty will be eliminated?”
Global Citizen responded as follows: “It will be a long and difficult journey — sometimes we will encounter and suffer failures.
But as with the ever great civil rights movements and the fight against apartheid, we will be successful because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the stars of this year’s New York event hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use navy to “block” Russian energy exports — Secretary of the Interior
Washington may “if necessary” flee to its navy to prevent the influx of Russian energy to markets, including those in the Middle East, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke — Washington Examiner said.
Zinke argued that Russia’s involvement in Syria — especially where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government — is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is the desire to mediate in energy trade, as it is in Eastern Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
“The United States, because of its navy, has the ability to ensure that the sea routes remain open and, if necessary, to create a blockade to ensure that their energy does not hit the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants of the Consumer Energy Alliance event, a non-profit group that calls itself the “power consumer’s voice” in the United States.
He also compared Washington’s approaches to Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually the same.
“The economic option of Iran and Russia is about the use and replacement of fuels,” he said, comparing Russia to a “killer who knows one trick” with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
These statements came as the Trump administration continues its mission to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe — which is a much cheaper option for European consumers compared to Russian gas.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said made Berlin a “slave” to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the <0x24>11 billion Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which is intended to double its existing capacity to 110 billion square meters, is an exclusively economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fierce opposition to the implementation of this project comes solely from economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with the U.S. energy secretary in Percy.
The position of the United States has prompted a violent reaction by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, the German Industry Federation (BDI), has called on the United States to not interfere in the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I think this is a big problem when a third country interferes in our energy supplies," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), after a recent meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will consider running for president in 2020.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that after the midterm elections, she would consider running for president.
During a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering her candidacy.
“The time has come for women to go to Washington and repair the corrupt government, and this is also the case for women in the top position,” she said.
“After November 6th, I will consider my candidacy for the position of President.”
During the meeting, Warren spoke of President Donald Trump, saying he was “guiding the country in the wrong direction.”
“I’m very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy,” she said.
Warren without a garden expressed her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, “Of course, we need an FBI investigation before voting.”
A poll published on Thursday, however, showed that most voters don’t think Warren should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters who voted for the option “probably” said the senator should not run, according to a survey conducted by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidate.
The poll showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick’s candidacy — 38 percent of people supported his potential candidacy, and 48 percent were against it.
Other well-known names from the Democratic camp taken into consideration in relation to the potential 2020 candidacy were Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, the Associated Press said.
Sarah Palin talks about PTSD Track Palin during Donald Trump's election age
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the military in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“What my own son has to go through, what he has to go through when he returns, I understand other families who feel the effects of PTSD and the injuries our soldiers come back with,” she told the public at the Donald Trump election in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called her son's arrest "a taboo subject", after which she said of her son and other war veterans: "they return a little bit displaced, they come back in disrepair, they come back, wondering if they will be given respect for what their fellow warriors have done in their country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasila, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against women, inclined to falsely testify in a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon in a state of incompetence, said Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasila Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the fight against the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge for a new U.S. policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 states and districts filed a letter of amicus curiae in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker fighting the policy, according to NBC News.
The full name of the cause in Grace v. Sessions lawsuit, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy, has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and his brutal gang sons" were upset about her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
Attorneys in favour of Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where there are a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as countries struggling with widespread gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy revoked the 2014 Board of Immigration Appeals decision that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, Attorney General of the District of Columbia, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores state, federal and international law in force for decades".
“Federal law requires that all applications for asylum be considered on the basis of specific facts and circumstances, and such a ban violates this principle,” the Amicus Curi<0xC3><0xA6> letter said.
Prosecutors further argued in the letter that a policy of refusing immigrants to enter would harm the U.S. economy, claiming that they could become entrepreneurs and “establish the necessary workforce.”
In June, General Prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear on a racial, religious, ethnic background or because of belonging to a particular social group or having such and not other political convictions,” said Sessions in a statement.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems — even the serious ones — that people from all over the world face on a daily basis.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu in a situation where the death toll has doubled in a race aimed at finding survivors
For the survivors, the situation became more and more tragic.
“It’s a very intense feeling,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, comforting her hot-tempered son in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute an ambulance brings the body.
There is no clean water.”
Residents were seen returning to destroyed homes, searching for water-soaked things, and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by a 7.5-degree earthquake, quickly flooded.
Some of the wounded, including Two Haris, who suffered a fracture of the spine and arm, rested outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside due to severe secondary shocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he told of a violent earthquake that shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save yourself.
I think I've been pushed into the wall room," — Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the city for the wedding.
“I heard my wife cry out for help, and her voice was silent.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe.”
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of “shocking” propaganda.
A week after the official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page advertisement in the U.S. newspaper praising the mutual benefits of U.S.-Chinese trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of exploiting U.S. pro-Americans.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the paid China Daily supplement in the Des Moines Register — the most popular newspaper in Iowa — accusing China of attempting to interfere in the U.S. Congress elections — which will be repealed by the U.S. Senate.
Trump’s allegation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election has confirmed what U.S. officials told Reuters that this is a new stage in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place commercials promoting trade with their countries, Beijing and Washington are currently leading an escalation in the trade war that has led to a rise in tariffs on mutual imports.
China’s tariffs at the start of the trade war were to hit exporters in states like Iowa that supported the Republican Party of Trump, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former Iowa state governor — the main exporter of agricultural products to China — said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
Branstad said in an article in the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register that “China is now, with double force, starting to torture by placing propaganda advertisements in our own free press.”
“In engaging in its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the respected American tradition of freedom of speech and the free press by placing paid advertising in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
Therefore, there will be no voices of opposition in the Beijing street kiosk and there will be no real reflection of the divergent opinions that the Chinese may have about China’s disturbing economic direction, given that the media is under control.
He added that “one of the most famous Chinese newspapers refused to publish” his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans kidnapped women with the right to vote by Kavanaugh affair, analysts warn
While many of the leading Republicans support and weapons nominated to the Supreme Court by Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several allegations of sexual assault, the analyst warns that members will meet during the upcoming mid-term elections.
The emotion that accompanies this event is incredibly big, and most Republicans already want to officially vote.
“This cannot be reversed,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse, said in a paper published on Saturday.
Reeher said he has doubts as to whether the attempt by Senator Jeff Flake (Arizona) to conduct an FBI investigation at the last minute is enough to calm the angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday — they will not forget it tomorrow and they will not forget it until November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokeswoman for MoveOn, according to a Washington-based newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted the slogan “November is coming,” demonstrating in the Senate hall due to a decision by Republicans controlling the Judicial Commission not to withdraw Kavanaugh’s nomination despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony, Mic said.
“The level of democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond the scale,” said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst.
“People say he was already tall — and that’s true.
But it can be higher, especially among indecisive suburban women and younger voters aged 18 to 29, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which she detailed her allegations of sexual assault addressed to a candidate in the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that if the Republicans decided to endorse the nomination, it could be re-tried.
“The Republican Party has to deal with a slight mess,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the vote of the commission or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be elected, it’s also about how the Republicans handled the situation and how they treated Ford,” Guy Cecil, the group’s director of USA Priories, told a news channel.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided as to who to believe in the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with the latter a little more support.
A new YouGov survey found that 41 percent of respondents believed Ford’s testimonies strongly or rather, while 35 percent said they believed Kavanaugh’s testimonies.
In addition, 38% of respondents said that Kavanaugh was likely or certainly lying when testifying, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After pressure was put on Flake, the FBI began an investigation into the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, who is Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Last week, Ford was sworn in to the Senate Judiciary Commission that Kavanaugh, under the influence of alcohol, had attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the nominee for the Supreme Court showed her her genitals while studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web developer plans to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook platforms.
Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google platforms.
The latest technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on an open source platform — Solid — belonging to Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which individuals have access to specific information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the purpose of creating Inrupt was “domination of the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said, referring to the startup.
“The historic moment has come.”
The app uses the Solid platform technology to enable people to create their own “online store with personal data” or otherwise POD.
It can include contact lists, lists of things to do, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify available in one browser and at the same time.
The unique feature of the online store with personal data is that it depends entirely on the user who has access to what information.
The company calls it “personal authorization through data.”
According to the company’s president, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to provide resources, processes and appropriate skills to help make the Solid platform available to all people.
Currently, the company includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers employed to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, tech makers around the world were able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team weren’t talking to Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change that will bring all of their business models upside down from day to day.
“Don’t ask them for permission.”
Berners-Lee wrote in a press release on Saturday that “Inrupt’s mission is to deliver commercial and ecosystem energy to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the Solid platform.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been very much involved in the debate on net neutrality.
Inrupt Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely excited to think about the next era of network development,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Victory's Crusade in the First World War
The memory of England’s only spiritual Church, which was awarded the Victoria Cross as a combatant during World War I, was celebrated 100 years later in his hometown.
Reverend Colonel Bernard Vann was awarded on 29 September 1918 for his raid on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later, never knowing that he was awarded the highest British military order.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that revealing the stone exactly on the 100th anniversary of his grandfather’s awards was “extremely symbolic.”
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "in a very dense fog and under a strong blade from field departments and machine guns."
He then hurried to the line of fire and “with the greatest courage” led her forward, after which he single-handedly launched an attack on the field division position, damaging three of them.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 — just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I would never agree to, but at the same time something humble.”
Together with his brother, Dr. James Vann, he laid a veil after completing the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band's parade.
Michael Vann said he feels "very honored to be able to take part in the parade" and added that "the courage of a real hero manifests itself in the support he receives from many people."
MMA fans did not sleep all night to watch the Bellator 206 gala, instead they got the Peppa Pig.
Imagine you haven’t slept all night to watch the emotionally packed Bellator 206 gala and finally can’t see the main fight.
The gala program in San Jose contained 13 fights, including six on the main card, and was shown live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the battle, the viewers in the UK were shocked by a change to the Peppa Pig program.
Some were disappointed that they didn’t sleep until early in the morning, especially to see this fight.
One of the fans on Twitter described the change to a children’s cartoon as “some sick joke.”
“According to the government regulation, such content is inappropriate for it to be released at 6 a.m., making a change to the children’s program necessary,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
“Peppa pig, yes.”
Bellator’s chairman, Scott Coker, said they are working on a schedule to include viewers from the UK in the future.
“When I think about the situation again, I think we can fix it,” Coker said.
“But it is the sixth Sunday morning, so we will not be able to deal with it until Sunday according to our time, and Monday according to their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when there was a change in the program, we were overwhelmed by a lot of comments, none of which sounded friendly.
We were trying to fix it... we thought it was a technical failure.
But it was not just a legal issue.
I can promise you that this situation will never happen again.
We're going to limit the program to five fights instead of six -- that's to the standard amount. Too much we wanted to please the fans and unfortunately we've overtaken it.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels 'worse' due to sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic water jumper, says he grew up feeling worse than everyone else because of his sexuality, but it gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he did not realize that not everyone was like him until he went to high school.
In Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, Lauren Laverne said he was talking about gay rights to give “hope” to others.
He also said that he would become a parent that made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the usual host of this broadcast for many years, took a few months off due to the disease.
Appearing in Laverne's program for the first time, Daley said that as he grew up, he felt "less valuable" than others because "the simultaneous likes of boys and girls were not socially acceptable."
“To this day, this feeling of lesser value and being different is something that gives me the strength to be successful.”
He said he wanted to prove that it was “something worthwhile” not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The twice-brown Olympic medalist has become a loud LGBT community activist and has used his performance at this year’s Community of Nations Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he decided to express himself because he felt happy to be able to live openly, without any implications, and wanted to give others “hope.”
A three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man — the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 — “surprised him.”
Daley married Oscar winner (who is 20 years older than him) last year, noting that such an age difference was never a problem for him.
“When you’re going through so much at such a young age,” he meant his first Olympics at the age of 14 and the death of his father from cancer three years later, he said that it was difficult for him to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar experiences.
The couple became parents in June of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley. Daley said that his perception of certain things had completely changed.
“Last year, the most important thing for me was to win a gold medal,” he said.
"And you know what, there's more important things than Olympic gold medals.
“My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was dying, and one of the last things he asked about was whether they had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics — he wanted to have a first place.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘You won’t be with us to be in the first place, Dad,’” he said.
“I held him in my hand when he stopped breathing. Only when he stopped breathing and died, I realized that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life — jumping into the water before the crowd at the Olympics — it was the best feeling possible,” he said.
It also inspired him to choose the first song — Proud by Heather Small — that accompanied him during the preparations for the Olympics and that still spices him with a ivory skin.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Showing no Mickelson's form on the bench during Saturday's Ryder Cup part
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he will play his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to work on his form to keep his seal.
Mickelson, who plays for the twelfth time in the event every two years, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk during Saturday’s fourball and foursome games.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as it often happened in his case in the United States team, the five-time main winner had to spend the day doping the team and working on improving his game in hopes of repairing the causes.
The 48-year-old, who has never given the simplest shots, even at the peak of his career, doesn’t do well on the narrow field of Le Golf National, where mistaken strikes are ruthlessly punished by long roughys.
And if the field itself is not disappointing enough for Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, he must face the precision of the winner of the British Open — Francesco Molinari, who joined forces with debutant Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of those matches.
If the Americans (with a loss of four points at the start of 12 singles) start the game with the fair, Mickelson's match may prove to be extremely crucial.
Furyk expressed his trust in his player — he was rather unable to do anything else.
"He fully understood his role today, he shook my back, embraced my hand and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He's very confident.
He is in the gallery of fame and has brought a lot to play for his teams both in the past and this week.
I didn't think he'd play two games.
I thought there would be more of them, but that's how it happened and we had to do it.
He wants to play all the time, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for Sunday's Ryder Cup matches.
This may mean the end of his Ryder Cup career, which has never matched his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven remissions on his account, Furyk said that his presence contributed a lot to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, tactful, ridiculous, and it’s good to have him in the band room,” he explained.
“I think the young players had a good time with him this week, which was nice to see.
It’s a lot more than just a game.”
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a big point advantage may soon shrink
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant point advantage before starting the singles on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a difficult game.
The Danish debuted in 1997 in a match at Valderrama, where he, along with his companion captain Sev Ballesteros, had a five-point lead over the Americans, but the line-up passed by the shortest possible hair, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“It is unforgettable that we had a great advantage on the Valderrama field; we also had a great advantage on the Brookline field where we lost, and in the case of the Valderrama field we won only by the hair,” Bjorn said, in a photo, after winning 5-3 Class of 2018 Golf both on Friday, 10th and 6th.
Time will show me and all the members of the team that it's not over yet.
You're doing your best tomorrow.
Get out there and do everything right.
The end will be only when the points appear on the board.
We have a goal that is to win a trophy, and that's what we need to focus on.
“From the beginning, I said that I would focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we also know who the people on the opposite side are – the best players in the world.”
Bjorn, excited about how his players managed on a difficult field, added: “I wouldn’t have done it better.
But tomorrow is different.
Singles start tomorrow, and that’s a different matter.
It’s good to play with a partner when everything goes well, but when you play alone, your golfing skills are tested to the limits of your ability.
This is the message that you need to convey to the players, to give everything with you tomorrow.
The partner also has to give everything.”
Jim Furyk, unlike Bjorn, will expect his players to achieve better scores in singles than during a game with his partner, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have won three points out of four.
Furyk himself experienced great returns on the last day, being a member of the winning team on the Brookline field, after which he failed after the European team performed a "miracle on the Medinah field".
"I remember every word," he said in response to the question, "how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, warmed up to the fight of his players on the last day."
“Tomorrow we’re playing 12 important games — you’d like to start at a fast pace, as it happened on the Brookline and Medinah fields.
If this move goes one way, it will exert a lot of pressure on the midfielders.
We have set up our composition accordingly and set up the boys in a way that would allow us to spell tomorrow.”
Thomas was entrusted with the task of leading the contract, facing Rory McIlroy in the main game, as well as Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter — the other European player in the team.
“I’ve decided on this group of guys in this order because I think he’ll be able to do it all the time,” Bjorn said of his choices on the singles.
New German Warship Delayed Again <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The latest frigate of the German navy should be put to use in 2014 to replace the aging warships from the Cold War, but this will not happen until at least next year due to a defective media outlet as a result of the lack of the media outlet and the roulette.
The deployment of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the main vessel of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg class, was shifted to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, referring to the words of a military spokesman.
The ship was expected to be incorporated into the navy in 2014, but as a result of the problems that arose after delivery, it was necessary to make changes to this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class units ordered by the navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
Of course, they will be equipped with a powerful unit, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft missiles, as well as technological solutions that prevent detection, ensuring, among other things, reduction of radar, infrared and acoustic traces.
Other important features include longer periods between maintenance — the operation of new frigates should be possible even for two years away from the parent ports.
Continuous delays mean, however, that these modern warships, which are designed to enable the Germans to respond to situations abroad, will be obsolete at the time of service starts, notes Die Zeit.
The unhappy F125 frigate appeared on the first page of the newspaper last year when a German naval officer officially refused to release the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time a warrior returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but German media reported a number of key “software and hardware shortcomings” that made the ship useless in the war mission.
Software flaws were particularly significant, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships are to be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, which is half less than the older Bremen class frigates.
It also turned out that the ship is much too heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the navy to carry out future modernizations.
The 7,000-tonne Rhineland-Palatinate ship is thought to be twice as heavy as the ships of a similar class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to faulty equipment, the cost of the entire project — including crew training — is also a problem.
It is said to have reached an astonishing level of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0x24>3.6 billion), while the initial cost amounted to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
Problems with dedication to the use of new frigates are gaining particular importance in light of recent warnings that the German naval fleet's strength is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defence commission, admitted that the sailors “will end up with ships capable of use.”
He also said that the problem had escalated over time as a result of the withdrawal of old units without providing replacement ships.
In addition, he expressed his dissatisfaction with the fact that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates could be included in the naval fleet.
The National Trust listens to the secret lives of non-operators
New research conducted on the estate in the Highlands, Scotland, aims to show how non-opers use the landscape to obtain food.
The results of the study are expected to shed new light on the behavior of these exceptional flying mammals and help target future actions to protect them.
Research conducted by researchers from the National Trust for Scotland will concern common and small, as well as brown long-eared dwarfs and dwarfs from the Red Nights family at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be deployed in key locations around the property to track the activity of non-operators throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct field research using portable detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all recordings aims to determine the frequency of the signals sent by the neoprene and how the individual species behaves.
Then a population map and a report will be developed to create a detailed picture of their behavior on a landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important to neoprene and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of work related to habitat management, such as the creation of grasslands, as well as the best ways to maintain forest areas for non-operators and other related species.
The populations of non-perishers in Scotland and throughout the UK have declined considerably over the past century.
They are endangered by construction and development works that have an impact on the ridges and the loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting installations can also pose a threat, just like flies and some chemicals used in building materials, and even domestic cats.
The squirrels aren't really blind.
However, due to the nighttime habits, their hunting ears are more helpful than the eyes in catching the catch.
They use a complex echolocation technique to search for worms and obstacles on their way.
The NTS organization, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land nationwide, takes neoprene very seriously.
It consists of ten trained experts, who regularly conduct research, cluster checks, and sometimes even rescue actions.
The organization even set up the first and only dedicated reef in Scotland on the Threave estates in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight out of ten Scottish reef species.
David Thompson, the property manager, says that it is the ideal territory for non-operators.
"Threave has a great area for the neoprene," he said.
“We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and great settlements.
However, there are still many unknowns when it comes to neoprene. The work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to develop."
It stresses the importance of checks on the occurrence of neoprene before entering into maintenance work in the holdings, as the accidental destruction of a single herd can kill up to 400 females and young people, which can lead to the extinction of the entire local population.
They are under protection—killing, torture or harassing them, as well as destroying their garlands is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish Bat Conservation Trust officer, encouraged public opinion to provide assistance.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our non-operators, and in the case of many species, we don’t even know how their populations deal with them.”
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape, while his lawyers intend to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described charges against him of rape as “fake news,” saying people “will be promoted” using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German information magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
A Portuguese Juventus assailant was charged with raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to Friday's news, the footballer was supposed to pay a woman <0x24>375,000 for silence.
Ronaldo (33 years old), a few hours after the allegations were announced, described the reports as “fake news” in a live feed on Instagram directed to his 142 million followers.
“No, no, no, no, no.
Today’s reports are fake news,” said the five-time gold ball winner.
“They want to be promoted using my name.
It's nothing new.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but it's part of my job.
I'm happy and everything's fine," the footballer added with a smile on his lips.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel magazine for allegations that they have called “inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy protection,” according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for “moral damages in the amount corresponding to the gravity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The event took place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went to the footballer’s room where he allegedly raped a woman anal — according to documents filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged siege and told her that “99 percent is a good guy” who was visited by that “one percent”.
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but it was done with mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that photos of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later agreed to an extrajudicial agreement because she was "afraid of revenge" and "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old says she wants to revoke the deal now because she can’t forget the alleged entry.
During the alleged attack, Ronaldo moved from Manchester United to Real Madrid and this summer moved to Juventus after paying him <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: Britain 'will regret all the time' the departure of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would be “deplorable at all times” if it lost its world leader in car manufacturing after leaving the European Union, Business Minister Greg Clark said.
He added that he was “quiet” when a representative of Toyota UK told the BBC in an interview that if the UK leaves the EU without an agreement, production at the Burnaston factory near Derby would be temporarily suspended.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
A representative of the Japanese carmaker said the effects of delays at the border in the absence of a Brexit deal could lead to a reduction in jobs.
The Burnaston factory, which manufactures the Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“In my view, if the UK leaves the European Union at the end of March without an agreement, then there will be a halt to production at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers fear leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade works, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW plans to close its Mini car factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns — as automakers claim — concern the risks associated with the supply chain if the UK leaves the European Union without an agreement.
Toyota’s production line operates on a “just-in-time” basis, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29, there may be difficulties at the border, which according to industry representatives may lead to delays and part shortages.
As a representative of the company said, Toyota would not be able to withstand more than one day without deliveries to its Derbyshire factory, which would stop production.
Clark said Chequers Theresy May’s plan for future EU relations was “precisely designed to avoid border checks.”
“We need an agreement. We want to achieve the best possible agreement that will not only allow us to enjoy the current success, but also allow us to make appropriate use of this situation,” he told BBC Radio 4 today.
“The statements not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers indicate that we need to be able to continue what consisted of a very efficient supply chain set.”
The representative of Toyota was unable to determine for how long the production will be halted, but warned that in the long run the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant, which would lead to a reduction in employment.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at the Burnaston plant for 24 years and is a member of the board of directors of the union organization Unite, said that the members of the union are increasingly concerned: “I know from experience that if jobs are eliminated, they will never be used again.
The government spokesman said: “We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the European Union.”
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again, the White House says
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "delayed by another week" due to the ongoing fight for the supreme court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates the possibility of Russian interference in the election, links between Trump’s close associates and Russia, and potential obstructions to the judiciary by the president.
Trump’s resignation of the Deputy Attorney General, thus threatening Mueller’s independence, has been a hot topic in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about wearing a hearing to record talks with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president from office on the basis of the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denies these reports.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House in the face of reports as if he were to resign.
The date of the meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York, was set for Thursday.
Trump said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein. A meeting was postponed to avoid colliding with a hearing by the Senate Judicial Commission, during which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the vote in the Senate.
Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date for this meeting has not yet been set, it may take place this week, or it may be postponed for another week, taking into account all the events related to the Supreme Court.
We’ll see, I’ll tell the press about it.”
Several journalists challenged this statement: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
The program manager, Chris Wallace, asked the reason for this.
Sanders said that a small number of press conferences were not caused by the reluctance to "ostentatory" television journalists, and added: "I will not hide that they are "ostentatory".
She then suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The current president is holding more ‘questions and answers’ sessions than any other president before him,” she said, adding, without providing evidence: “We’ve met the numbers.”
The press conferences will continue to take place, Sanders said, but “if journalists have the opportunity to directly ask the President of the United States questions, this is a much better solution than talking to me.
We are trying to do this regularly, and we have done it very often in the last few weeks, and press conferences will leave places for such sessions, during which you will be able to talk directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with host dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are a rarity.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated why it is, acting too free and sometimes strangely in front of the crowded journalists.
Minister of Health writes to EU workers employed by NHS Scotland in the face of Brexit concerns
The health minister has sent a letter to workers from the European Union who are employed in the Scottish health service to express their gratitude to the country and to ask them not to leave after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain left the European Union.
The Scottish government has already pledged to cover the costs of considering applications for "settled status" for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in her letter: “Negotiations on Britain’s exit from the European Union continued in the summer, and the appropriate decisions will be made in the fall of this year.
The UK government has also stepped up its preparations for a possible scenario of a no-deal exit.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to repeat once again how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes surgery as a result of a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers striker Christion Abercrombie underwent surgery as a result of a head injury in a Saturday match with Vanderbilt Commodores, which ended in the team's failure with Tennessee 31-27, Mike Organ said.
Rod Reed, head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the player had suffered an injury shortly before the end of the first half.
“He went to the sideline, then he fell to the ground,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the lateral line, then placed it on the carriers and carried it out for further research.
A Tennessee State spokesman told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there are no details yet regarding the type/size of the injury,” and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie (a second-year student fired from representing the university for a year to train his skills) plays his first season in the Tennessee State team after transferring from Illinois.
On Saturday before the end of the game, he had five wickets, giving him 18 wickets throughout the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher tax fee when buying a property in the UK.
In accordance with the new plans, a buyer from abroad will be charged a higher tax for the purchase of a property in the UK. The funds thus obtained will be allocated to help the homeless.
This move aims to destroy Jeremy Corbyn’s success in attracting a young electorate.
The tax increase will cover people who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury Ministry predicts that it will receive up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year for help from homeless people.
Theresa May announced today that foreign property buyers in the UK will be charged a higher tax, and the additional funds obtained in this way will be allocated to help the homeless.
This move is seen as an attempt to stifle Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract the young electorate with promises of cheaper housing and increase the burden of more earnings.
Increased taxation will apply to individuals and non-tax companies in the UK. Additional measures are intended to assist the government in the fight against homelessness.
The additional fee, which is charged in addition to the current tax, including the higher rates imposed two years ago for second houses and apartments purchased for rent, may amount to as much as three percent.
The Treasury expects this move to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built properties in London are purchased by residents of other countries, leading to price increases and making it difficult to buy the first home or apartment.
Because many foreigners buy real estate, and spend most of their time outside the country, many wealthy regions — and especially the capital — have turned into a “city of spirits”.
The new rules come just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax cut to help young people buy their first home.
He accused major developers of maintaining high real estate prices by occupying the land, but not using it, and also called on Prime Minister May to lift the limits of cheap housing in order to eliminate the "residential scandal" in the UK.
Jeremy Corbyn announced a number of attractive housing reforms, including rent regulation and the end of the emission "for no reason".
It also wants to give local authorities greater powers in the construction of new homes.
Theresa May said: “Last year, I said that as a prime minister, I am committed to rebuilding the British dream that the lives of every next generation will be better than the previous.
This also means repairing our enchanted housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not right that people who do not live here, as well as foreign companies, can buy real estate here with equal ease as hard working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of their own home has become far away, so the humiliation associated with the need to stay overnight on the street remains too real.”
Jack Ross: "My biggest ambition is to become a Scotland's picker"
Sunderland team coach Jack Ross says his "highest ambition" is to be Scotland's picker at some point.
This forty-year-old Scottish team is committed to the recovery of North-East club, which currently ranks third in League One with a three-point loss to the best team.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after introducing club St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
But I only managed to get to B," Ross said in an interview with BBC Scotland's Sportssound.
“As a child, I watched Scottish games with my father in Hampden and it always attracted me.
However, such an opportunity will only come as long as I succeed as a coach of the club.”
Among Ross' predecessors as Sunderland coach were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former coach Alloa Athletic says he doesn’t feel discouraged, taking on the role after such famous personalities in such a big club, rejecting proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Today, success will be measured by whether I will be able to bring this club back to the Premier League.
Given its structure and the facilities it has, there is undoubtedly its place,” he adds.
“Doing this won’t be easy, but I probably feel like I’ve been successful here, only as long as I can do it.”
Ross's coaching career has only lasted for three years, before he was an assistant coach at Dumbarton and for 15 months he was part of the Hearts coaching team.
He then helped Alloa re-advance after degrading to the third league, and in the next season led the St Mirren team from the end of the fall to the championship title.
Jack Ross says he now feels much more comfortable than when he played in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was a real turning point,” says Alloa’s coaching position.
“I really believed that running the team is a lot better for me than playing the game itself.
It sounds strange because as a player I managed to make a good profit and have achieved some tangible successes.
However, playing is a heavy piece of bread.
Every week, you have to go through different situations.
They still meet me when it comes to the stress and pressure associated with the work of the coach, but I feel good in this role.
I've always wanted to train others, and now I'm doing it, and I can say that at this point I feel the most in place in my entire adult life."
All interviews at Sportsound can be heard on Sunday, September 30 at Scotland Radio between 12:00 and 13:00 BST
Research shows that the best time for beer is at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer heatwave caused a violent influx of customers to British pubs, but it was reflected in restaurants networks.
Studies have shown that in July sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7 percent, but in restaurants it dropped by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of CGA’s consulting firm, which developed the data, says: “Continuous heats and longer than expected England’s participation in the World Championships caused the results from July to form similarly to those of June, when the turnover was 2, when the turnover in restaurants was more than expected.
The 1.8 percent decline in sales in restaurants in July, recorded in June, has increased even further.
The bars and pubs that offered drinks were definitely the best — their sales growth exceeded the decline in restaurants.
Pubs serving food also suffered during heats, although not as much as restaurant owners.
Looks like people were just thirsty for it.
Sales of beverages in managed pubs and bars increased by 6.6 percent this month, and food — it dropped by three percent.”
Paul Newman, RSM’s analyst for the entertainment and tourism industry, said: “These results are part of the trend we’ve been following since the end of April.
The most important factors affecting the size of consumption 'outside the home' remain the weather and major sporting or social events.
The fact that restaurant networks are experiencing difficult moments is not surprising, although a 4.8 percent drop in sales compared to the previous year will have particularly severe consequences if you take into account ongoing pressures to reduce costs.
A long and fiery summer has come at the least favorable time for the owners of the food-serving premises and time will show if the slightly more moderate temperatures we had in August will bring so much needed exhalation.”
The overall growth in sales in pubs and restaurants, taking into account the newly opened ones, was 2.7% in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand development.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales in the UK’s pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups with a total turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
Studies have shown that one in five children — some just 11 years old — have secret social media accounts that they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 undergraduate students showed an increase in the number of “fake Insta” pages.
The news has sparked fears that content of a sexual nature is published on them.
Twenty percent of students say they have a “main” account that shows their parents.
One in five children — some aged just 11 years old — set up social media accounts that they do not disclose to adults.
A survey of 20,000 undergraduate students showed a rapid increase in the number of fake Insta accounts — the name refers to Instagram, where you can share photos.
The news sparked fears that these accounts would be used to publish content of a sexual nature.
Twenty percent of students admitted to running a hammered “main” account that shows their parents, and they also have private accounts.
One of the mothers, who accidentally met on the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter, met a teenage girl who told others to “rape her.”
A study conducted in independent schools by the Digital Awareness UK agency and the Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) showed that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles. Half of them admit to maintaining private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, president of HMC, said: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers are creating their places online where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle to Become ‘Voice of Athletics’ on Board of Scottish Athletics
During the annual general meeting of the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics, Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Board of Directors as a non-executive director.
Eilidh Doyle is the most respected Scottish lightweight athlete. President Ian Beattie described this move as an excellent opportunity for people who manage sports to take advantage of the rich international experience she has gained over the past decade.
“Eilidh enjoys enormous respect in the communities of Scottish, British and global light athletes, and we are confident that introducing it to the Board of Directors will bring great benefits to Scottish light athletes,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am very happy to be able to convey the voice of athletes to the council, and I hope to be able to really help manage sports in Scotland.”
The American, who among his four gold Olympic medals has won the 200- and 400-meter runs at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, and now regularly performs as an expert on the BBC, cannot walk as a result of a temporary non-blood attack.
He tweeted: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that time would show if I was recovering and to what extent.
It was a four-way job, but I fully recovered, I learned to walk again and I went back to training!
Thank you for all your support words!”
Advertising breastfeeding, comparing mothers to cows, arouses extreme emotions on the internet
The lactating company sparked a storm on the internet, publishing an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers to breastfeeding cows.
To announce the launch of the “world’s first silent lactator to wear underwear,” its manufacturer, Elvie, published a ridiculous advertisement in the form of a disc that emphasizes the freedom it provides to mothers.
She introduces four real mothers dancing in a field filled with silk to the song, where they hear the words "Yes, I'm breastfeeding, but I can't see the tail" and "If you haven't noticed, it's not just my tits."
Refren goes as follows: “Pump them out, pump them out, feed them, pump them out, pump them out, feed your master.”
Advertising, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, has sparked a lot of controversy on the internet.
The film currently has 77,000 views and hundreds of comments. Users express extreme opinions, many of them claim that it is inappropriate to joke about the "horror" that takes place in the dairy industry.
“Using cows to advertise this product was a very bad idea.
Like people to give milk, they have to get pregnant and give birth to a baby, with their babies being taken from them a few days after birth,” one of the users wrote.
Elvie's breastfeeder can be worn unnoticed under the breastfeeding pantyhose (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented: “It is, of course, traumatic for both the mother and the child.
“Of course, let’s use cows to advertise breastfeeding for mothers who can hold their children.”
Someone else added: “This advertisement is completely detached from reality.”
Others use the clip — one of the women said the song was “fun” in her opinion.
“I think it’s a great idea.
If I were still breastfeeding, I'd buy one.
When I was eating, I felt like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I'm not trying a second floor in it.
It’s a brilliant invention,” someone wrote.
Another commented: “It’s a funny advertisement directed at mothers who draw food (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like ‘bloody’.
It is not intended to praise or criticize the dairy industry.”
At the end of the film, it turns out that women danced with lactates attached discreetly to their breasts.
The campaign was inspired by the idea that many breastfeeding women feel like cows.
However, Elvie’s breastfeeder is completely silent, there are no cables or tubes and you can wear it unnoticed under the breastfeeding bust, which gives women the freedom to move, hold children on their hands, and even get out of the house while pulling food.
Ana Balarin, partner and creative director at Mother, said: “Elvie Lactator is such a revolutionary product that he deserves a bold and provocative premiere.
Combining breastfeeding women and dairy cows, we wanted to showcase all the challenges associated with the withdrawal of food, while presenting in a fun and coherent way the incredible sense of freedom that it provides.
It's not the first time that Elvie's lactating has hit the top of the newspaper.
During London Fashion Week during the Marty Jakubowski show, a mother of two children appeared on the run with this product.
Hundreds of children of immigrants have been secretly transferred to a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of immigrant children detained is growing violently, although the number of people crossing the border each month does not actually change. This is due in part to the fact that the harsh rhetoric and rules introduced by President Trump’s administration have made it difficult to place the sponsors.
Most sponsors are also usually undocumented immigrants who are afraid of being deported if they report after the child.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adults living in the joint farm would be taking fingerprints, which would then be passed on to immigration authorities.
Last week, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, Matthew Albence, testified before Congress that his agency had already arrested dozens of people who had registered as sponsors of childless children.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees were not previously listed.
“Almost 80 percent of those who are sponsors or live with them in one household are illegally in the country, and a large part of them are foreigners with a criminal past.
That’s why we’re constantly chasing them,” Albence said.
As part of efforts to accelerate the regulation of the situation of children, officials have introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of their detention — and not after 60 days, as the standard has been in place since then.
A lot will be put forward through videoconferencing, rather than in person, to ask an immigration judge to legalize their status.
Those who are not eligible for dismissal will be immediately deported.
According to staff at the shelter and reports that have been published in recent months, the longer children are in custody, the easier they can become restless or fall into depression, which in turn can lead to outbursts of aggression or attempts to escape.
Defenders found that these problems are even more serious for larger resorts such as Tornillo, where it is easier because of its size to overlook the signals that something bad is happening to the child.
They also added that moving children to a tent camp without providing them adequate time for emotional preparation or saying goodbye to friends can exacerbate the trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria calls on U.S., French and Turkish "occupation forces" to withdraw immediately
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moual also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the war in the country lasting eight years.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and "we will discuss them appropriately".
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he announced to the Assembly.
Moualem says the “war on terrorism is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been forced to leave their homes.
He says Damascus will continue to “run its holy battle until it clears Syria’s territory” from both terrorist groups and “every foreigner illegally staying on it.”
Currently, there are about 2,000 U.S. troops stationed in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish and Syrian forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
In addition, there are more than 1,000 French soldiers in the country that was destroyed by war.
With regard to refugees, Moualem said the conditions were good enough for them to return, and accused "some Western countries" of "arousing irrational fear" that would discourage them to return.
“We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations for help in these returns,” he said.
“They politicize things that should have a purely human dimension.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that until President Assad joins the opposition to a political agreement to end the war, Syria will not receive any reconstruction aid.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on establishing a buffer zone in the last large rebel bastion in Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey helped prevent a major attack by Syrian forces backed by Russia on a province in which three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement has a "clear time frame" and expressed hope that the military action will be targeted in jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Levant People's Defence Front, who will be "eliminated".
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the ruling party and the opposition to draw up a sketch of the post-war constitution of Syria and prepare for elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the commission, saying the panel's work should be limited "to verifying the provisions of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win Elections Again
According to this logic, President Trump would be elected for a second term in 2020, unless, as many liberal observers probably hope, his presidency ends with an early removal from office and a scandal.
It would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of the presidency so far.”
So far, there are no signs of tiredness of the audience.
Since 2014, CNN’s first-team viewing results have more than doubled and reached 1.05 million viewers, while MSNBC’s nearly tripled to 1.6 million viewers.
According to Nielsen Fox News, it attracts an average of 2.4 million viewers in the hours of its highest viewing, an increase from 1.7 million four years ago, and broadcast on the MSNBC channel "The Rachel Maddow Show" has reached the top 3 million TV shows, 5 million TV shows, and 3 million TV shows.
“People are flying like sticks to the fire — that’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Bear, the lead producer of ABC’s “Designated Survivor” about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack on the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedian and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has a different theory.
She recalled driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
“It makes me laugh,” he replied.
“Chaos has fun value.”
Of course, reports from Washington could, like nothing else shown on television, condemn the Roe v. Wade case, the admissibility of immigrant families, or the state of the world economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
Besides, it’s not just about being a well-informed citizen of Trump when you watch a panel of experts debating Bob Woodward’s use of secret informants when writing the book “Fear,” about the coat of Paul Manafort’s “skins” and the coat of Paul Manafort’s “skin to the stork” for the sixth hour.
I’ll never look at Super Mario again like I used to.
“What he’s doing is in part reminiscent of the reality show in this respect, that it delivers new content every evening,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars”, about the changing crew and the daily returns on the show’s NFL and DFL’s.
You can't afford to miss an episode because you're going to have a backlash.
When I met Mike Fleiss this week, the weather on the north coast of Kauai Island, where he has his home, was beautiful, but he was sitting in the middle watching MSNBC and recording at the same time CNN.
He couldn't stand it, not when Brett Kavanaugh stood before the Senate Judiciary Commission and weighed the future of the Supreme Court.
“I remember how we used to do all these crazy programs and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought they were joking, but it turns out they were right.”

Money flows from the outside to the election campaign to Congress
It is no wonder that after the reorganization of the electoral districts, which resulted in the one-post race, two now-official congressmen will now be placed, to the 17th electoral district in Pennsylvania, the river of cash flows.
This newly formed suburban district of Pittsburgh represents in Congress the Democratic representative, Conor Lamb, who gained his place in another district during last spring’s special elections.
Lamb competes with another current congressman, the Republican Keith Rothfus who now represents former District 12 in Pennsylvania, which largely coincides with the new District 17.
The county maps were corrected after a January verdict by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, which ruled that the old counties were unfairly designated, which gave Republicans an advantage and was inconsistent with the constitution.
The race in the new 17th district began with a fight to fund the campaign between the party's main funding bodies—the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamba gained popularity in Pennsylvania after winning hair in the widely commented elections until the 18th election district, which took place in March.
The Republican has been in this position for more than a decade, and Donald Trump has won 20 points in the district.
Political experts have given Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but withdrew from the idea.
Diplomats have noted that Dominica and Panama have already recognized Beijing, despite Washington’s slight opposition.
In June 2017, President Donald Trump held a heartfelt meeting with Panama President Juan Carlos Varela, and until the moment of his dismissal by the partners of the Trump Organization management team, he had a hotel in Panama.
State Department officials have decided to revoke the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama because of “recent decisions to stop Taiwan’s recognition,” a spokesman for the Department of Health said in a statement this month.
However, the sanctions were to be applied only to El Salvador, which, according to estimates, received <0x24>140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, including to fight drugs and support development and the economy.
The proposed sanctions, which were intended to include restrictions on financial assistance and the granting of visas to certain persons, would be very severe for this Central American country, which is struggling with high unemployment and high murder rates.
As the international meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference, which was meant to concern security and economic prosperity, to address the conclusions of a similar meeting from the previous year's pre-immigrants, which had been seen as unprecedented in the past year.
In mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, thereby making any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Diplomats say that now at the conference, which is currently scheduled for mid-October, Vice President Mike Pence is due to make a speech, which is meant to be a sign of an invitation to a meeting of the administration’s representatives.
The three U.S. envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no new harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
White House spokesman John Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate presented by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal negotiations on condition of anonymity.
Their relationships were confirmed by an external analyst from the environment of the administration, who also spoke anonymously.
Learn about history
Another element could be the report by the special prosecutor, Robert Mueller, on the possible impairment of the actions of President Trump in the judiciary, for which there is now concrete evidence publicly available.
According to reports, Robert Mueller's investigation is also investigating whether Donald Trump's campaign had anything to do with Russia's attack on the U.S. election.
If the composition of Congress changes, President Trump will be held accountable by him in preparations for re-election, and perhaps even judged before the jury.
There are a lot of unknowns here and I don’t want to suggest that Trump’s fall — not even those in equal positions in Europe — is inevitable.
We all on both sides of the Atlantic have to make a choice that decides how long it can last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a state attack against Hitler if only the West resisted him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
This failed and we lost the opportunity to avoid the years of cuts that occurred thereafter.
The wheels of history revolve around such turning points, accelerating or slowing down the inevitable course of democracy.
There are a few such turning points in front of the Americans now.
What will we do if Donald Trump fires Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a man who depends on the future of Robert Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since we revealed in our newspaper that he proposed a secret recording of the president last year and speculated that he is not fit for this office.
According to Rosenstein, the report presented by The Times is inaccurate.
“How do we respond if the newly commissioned FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh turns out to be incomplete or unfair, or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court, despite credible accusations of sexual assault and misdemeanor?
And most importantly, in the middle of the presidential term, will we elect people to Congress who will hold Donald Trump accountable?
If we do not pass these trials, there will be difficult times for democracy.
However, I believe that we will succeed — because of the lesson I received in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew, and she was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my residence as an ambassador.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light the Sabbath candles on that table marked with a swastika.
Having such a legacy, how could I not look to the future with optimism?"

Rangers player Graham Dorrans is looking forward to the game with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers take Rapid Vienna on Thursday with the knowledge that a victory with the Austrians, obtained after an impressive remission from Villareal achieved this month in Spain, will significantly increase their chances of qualifying for Group G of the Europa League.
Up to a 2:2 remission from Villareal, knee injury prevented assistant Graham Dorrans from playing this season, but he believes the result will work for the Rangers as a trampoline for greater success.
“We did well because Villarreal is in good shape,” said the 31-year-old.
“We went to this game with the belief that we would achieve something – and we won the point.
Maybe we could still press them in the end, but in general, the remission is probably a fair result.
The Spaniards were probably better in the first half, but in the second we were better.
When it comes to Thursday, it is another important evening for Europe.
We hope we can get three points, but this game will be difficult, because our opponent has got a good score in his last game. However, I am sure that with the support of the kickers we will go through and win a positive result.
The last year has been definitely hard because of everything related to my injury and changes in the club itself, but now we all feel good in our places.
The team is great, and the boys really like to play. The training goes well.
“I hope we can go on, leave the last season behind and succeed.”
Fear of retirement savings spends women sleeping with the eyebrows
Although the people who took part in the survey knew exactly how they wanted to take care of them, few talked about it with their family.
In a study conducted by Nationwide, about half of the respondents said they were talking to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with their children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance company Nationwide.
Where to start?
Talk to your spouse and children: You will not prepare a family to take care of yourself unless you express your will in advance.
Together with your counselor and family, discuss where and how you want to be cared for, because this choice will be an important factor in determining costs.
Ask a financial advisor for help: He can help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Funds for long-term care can come from a traditional policy for such care, a hybrid policy that allows you to pay cash to cover such expenses, or from your own assets — if you own it.
Prepare legal documents: You will be prevented with this judicial battle.
Appoint a trusted health care officer who will supervise and ensure that the right people act according to your will if communication becomes impossible.
Consider also the employment of an attorney who will take care of the finances.
Choose a trusted person, because she will make financial decisions for you and make sure that all your bills are paid if you are not able to do it yourself.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent suddenly needs medical help and is just going to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write out all the information to get it ready.
“It’s not just about the finances, it’s about who the doctors are,” Martin asks.
“What medications are you taking?
Who will take care of the dog?
It’s worth having such a plan in hand.”
Man shot multiple times with wind turbine in Ilfracombe
The man was shot several times by a windshield as he returned home from the evening party.
The 40-kilometer was located in the vicinity of Oxford Grove, Ilfracombe, Devon County, when he was shot in the chest, belly and arm.
The police described the shooting, which took place around 2:30 p.m. BST, as "accidental action".
The victim did not see the attacker.
These injuries do not endanger the life of a man, and the police are requesting witnesses to report the incident.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
According to official reports, at least 384 people have died as a result of the severe earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and the death toll is likely to increase.
Rescuers were unable to obtain any information from the Donggal kapatenan, located north of Palu, near the epicenter of the 7.5-degree earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the Palu disaster.
Here are some of the most important information about the city of Palu and Donggala on Celebes island:
Palu is the capital of Central Celebes, a province located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island. It was estimated in 2017 that it had a population of 379,800.
When an earthquake and tsunami occurred, the city celebrated the 40th anniversary of its founding.
Dongala is a county (administrative unit below the province) extending along the north-west coast of the island over a length of more than 300 km.
It was estimated to have a population of 299,200 in 2017.
The main branches of the Central Celebs economy are fisheries and agriculture, which have developed especially in the coastal Donggala county.
Another source of income for the province is nickel mines, but they are mainly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency, earthquakes and tsunami have visited Palu and Donggal several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami that struck Donggala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, nine people died as a result of the tsunami in western Donggal.
Indonesia is located in the active seismic Pacific Ring of Fire, which causes earthquakes to occur there quite regularly.
The biggest earthquakes and tsunami in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake that struck the western coast of the province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, of which more than half are in Aceh.
2005: In late March and early April, the western coast of Sumatra witnessed a series of severe earthquakes.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias on the Sumatra coast.
2006: In the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, an earthquake of magnitude 6.8 has occurred, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: Near Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra, there was a 7.6-degree earthquake.
As a result, more than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai near the coast of Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters in height that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck Pidie Jaya County in Aceh Province, causing destruction and panic among people who still remember the devastation caused by the devastating earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time there was no tsunami, but the fighting buildings killed more than 100 people.
2018: Large earthquakes storm Indonesia's tourist island, Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on its northern side.
They caused the destruction of thousands of homes and brought temporary trouble to thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and candidate for vice president, Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report published on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers, a 29-year-old from the town of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on charges of domestic violence, obstruction of filing a report and opposition to the arrest.
According to a police report, when a friend of the suspect tried to call the police to report the crime, he picked up the phone.
KTUU station reports that Palin is detained in the Mat-Su investigation and has a <0x24>500 bail.
According to her information last Saturday, he stood in court, where he said in his defense speech that he was "certainly innocent".
There are three A-Class violations, which means that she can be fined up to a year in prison and <0x24>250,000 in fines.
He was also charged with B-class abuse, for which he was sentenced to <0x24>2,000 in prison and a fine.
This is not the first time that a criminal case has been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Then his mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaskan Veterans' Claims Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, obstruction of filing a report, and possession of weapons in a state of incompetence in connection with the incident.
His partner says he hit her in the face.
In 2016, a group of veterans criticized Sarah Palin, who linked her son’s aggressive behavior to the stress disorder he acquired during his service in Iraq.
Hundreds of people killed in tsunami after earthquake in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of Friday’s earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Celebes.
The 7.5-degree quake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and connectivity are not working, and the number of casualties is expected to increase in the coming days.
An earthquake occurred near the central part of the island of Celebes, which is located northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
On social media, there are videos showing the moment of disaster.
When the tsunami hit the coast, on the beach in Palu, where the festival was held, there were hundreds of people.
Federal Prosecutors Call for Death Penalty for Suspect of Terrorist Attack in New York
New York federal prosecutors are demanding the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov suspected of carrying out a terrorist attack in New York, which resulted in the death of eight people. This is a rare punishment — it has not been committed in this state for a federal crime since 1953.
To carry out the attack, which took place in October on a bicycle trail running along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, thirty-year-old Saipov allegedly used a rented Home Depot truck, which he took on his pedestrians and bikers.
According to the announcement in New York's southern district of the intention to demand the death penalty, in order to justify its necessity, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" committed suicide.
According to a court document, both of these charges are subject to the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal jury filed a 22-position indictment with Saipo, including eight allegations of murder in the course of illegal activity — which is a procedure commonly used by federal prosecutors in motor cases — criminal cases and criminal cases.
According to the prosecutors, the organization of the attack required "solid planning and reflection" and the way Saipov conducted it was described as "monstruous, cruel and immoral".
Sayfullo Habibulaevic Saipov brought damage, damage, and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernán Ferruchi, Hernán Diego Mendoza, and Alendra.
Five of the victims were Argentine nationals who were tourists in New York City.
The last time the death penalty was imposed in the southern district of New York was ten years ago.
Accused Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but he was sentenced to life in September 2009.
The death penalty as a result of a federal case was last executed in New York in 1953 on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. The marriage was lost after two years earlier they were found guilty of conspiracy and spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were lost on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the court documents, Saipov, who comes from Uzbekistan, did not show any release of conscience within a month of the attack.
Police say he told the investigator he was feeling good about what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov confessed to the authorities that he was inspired by the ISIS movies he watched on the phone.
According to police, he also demanded the hanging of the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
The indictment, which includes 22 charges, states that he is innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal attorneys who represent Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty and to reject life without the possibility of early release after acknowledgment of guilt will only prolong the suffering that these events have brought to all the parties involved,” he said.
Saipova's defense team has earlier asked prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Tory-backed MP says Nigel Farage should take responsibility for Brexit negotiations
During today’s protest, which took place during the Tory conference, Nigel Farage vowed to “mobilize the army of the people”.
Former leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) said politicians must “feel the heat” of the Eurosceptics when one of the MPs, Theresa May, suggested that he should take responsibility for negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told demonstrators in Birmingham that if Farage was Brexit secretary, “the United Kingdom would be out of the Union.”
However, joining the tory to remain in the community to a separate protest against Brexit, which was taking place in the city, further underlined the burden of conciliating its deeply divided ranks that are facing Theresa May.
The Prime Minister is trying hard to realize her plan of compromise with the Chequers among attacks by Brexit supporters, its opponents, and the European Union itself.
Its allies claim that despite its objections, it will seek to conclude a deal with Brussels and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its proposal and “chaos”.
Peter Bone told the Leave Means Leave summit in Solihull that he wanted to “throw away the plan from the Chequers.”
He suggested that the representative should be Nigel Farage, who should be responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If it were him, we would be out of the Union now,” he said.
Wellingborough deputy added: “I support Brexit, but we have to throw away the Chequers plan.”
Presenting his opposition to the European Union, he said: “This is not why we fought in world wars to be subject to someone now.
We want to have our rights in our country.”
Peter Bone rejected the suggestion that citizens had changed their minds since the vote in 2016: “Think that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the Union is completely false.”
Andrea Jenkyns, of the Tory Party, told reporters: “I’m just saying, ‘Mrs. Prime Minister, please listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not in general support, the opposition will not vote for it, neither our party nor our activists, who populate the streets and who chose us, do not support it.
Please abandon the plan with the Chequers and start listening."
In a statement to Prime Minister May, she added: “Presidents keep their positions when they keep their promises.”
Nigel Farage said politicians taking part in the demonstration must “feel hot” if they are to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us — the people — and the political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to tell them ‘we won’t let you do that.’”
Speaking to the rosy crowd, he added: “I want you to make the politicians who are on the verge of Brexit betrayal feel hot.
“We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country who gave us victory in the Brexit referendum, and we will not rest until we become an independent, independent, proud United Kingdom.”
At the time, Brexit opponents masked across the city to the center, where a two-hour demonstration took place.
A handful of activists branded “Torys against Brexit” banners after forming the group this weekend.
Labour activist Baron Andrew Adonis ridiculed conservatives for the security issues of the party application at the start of the conference.
“These are the people who claim that they can organize IT systems and all the technology to support the Canada plus plus plan, a smooth border, free trade without borders with Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a complete fake.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Elizabeth Warren Plans to 'Seriously Consider' Candidacy for President
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says after the November election, she will “think seriously about running for president.”
According to The Boston Globe, a Democrat representative from Massachusetts spoke about her future during a meeting with voters that took place on Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Elizabeth Warren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November, with Republican representative Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired the Trump campaign in Massachusetts during the 2016 election.
It is now said that in the 2020 election, Warren could defeat Trump.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday was her 36th meeting with voters in the town hall formula since Donald Trump took office.
One of the participants asked if he was planning to run for president.
Elizabeth Warren replied that it was time for “women to go to Washington to repair our corrupt government—and she’s talking about a woman on the top.”
Arrest of killer in which LSU team player Wayde Sims was killed
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Saturday reported the arrest of a suspect in a Friday shooting in which LSU basketball player Wayde Sims was killed.
Baton Rouge Police Department reported the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a conference that took place at 11:00 Eastern Time.
On Friday, a video of the shooting was published asking for help in identifying the man who was seen on it.
Twenty-year-old Wayde Sims was killed in a shooting near Southern University campus on Friday morning.
“Wayde Sims was shot in the head with a gun, as a result of which he died,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters.
Wayde stood in the defense of a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being at the scene of the crime, carrying a gun, and shooting at Wayde.
After his arrest, during which he did not resist, he was taken to the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
Measuring 1.98 m, Wayde Sims grew up in Baton Rouge. He played 32 games, starting 10 times in the last season, during which he spent an average of 17.4 minutes on the pitch, earning 5.6 points and counting 2.9 points per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after commanding the team allowed him to win with Sebastian Vettel
Since Valtteri Bottas qualified against Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it has become clear that the Mercedes team’s order will have a big impact on the race outcome.
Bottas, who started from the first field, started very well and almost defeated Hamilton, defending his position in the first two rounds and forcing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to reach the service point and allowed Hamilton to ride a pellet, which should decide on the loss of the race.
The Mercedes driver went to boxing in the next lap and appeared behind Vettel, but after the action round the wheel, the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inner part of the track, risking to push himself to the defensive after a double hit on the target of a rival.
Max Verstappen started from the end of the bet and at his 21st birthday at the end of the first round was in seventh place.
He then drove through much of the race because he did not change tires to make a quick finish and take Kimi Raikkonen fourth place.
Finally, he went to the service point in the 44th round, but in the other eight rounds he was no longer able to accelerate.
“It was a tough day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and proved to be a real gentleman when he was told to let me pass.
“The whole team has done everything they can to take the first two places,” Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body language.
During a meeting on Saturday, President Donald Trump joked with Senator Diana Feinstein, who held that she had not disclosed the contents of a letter from Christina Blasey Ford in which she accused the nominee for Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not refer directly to the testimony filed by Christina Ford before the Senate Justice Commission. Instead, he stated that what happened in the Senate, showed that the people were "spoken, spoofed, and spoofed."
“What could have happened is one thing, but this beautiful situation in the Senate, which we have been witnessing for a few days, when we see anger, when we see people who are angry, deceiving, evil and lying,” he said.
“We see what has been published and revealed, and then they tell us, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.’
I didn't do that."
Do you remember?
Dianna Feinstein, did you reveal it?
Remember her answer... did you reveal the contents of this document? — oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't reveal it."
Wait, wait, wait.
Did we reveal...No, we didn’t reveal,” he added, predicting the senator.
Diana Feinstein received a letter from Christina Ford describing the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and its contents leaked in early September. The senator denies that the source of the leak was her cabinet.
“I didn’t hide the insinuation of Dr. Ford, I didn’t reveal her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to be discretionary and I did not disclose the content in accordance with her request.”
However, her statement did not convince the president, who commented so during the meeting on Saturday: “I tell you, it was a really bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but that was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing the defense of a Supreme Court candidate whose three women have accused of sexual harassment, the president suggested that Democrats use insinuations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take over power by all means.
Seeing subtlety, maliciousness, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to destroy to take power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars — Belfast Giants 5:3
In a match with Dundee, Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants
The Dundee Stars kicked off their Friday loss in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants, winning a 5:3 rematch on Saturday.
The giants quickly gained a double-edged advantage after the shots of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cowney equalized the score, after which Dwyer again led the Giants to the lead.
Francois Bouchard scored again, scoring a goal for Dundee, after which the two goals scored by Lucas Lundvald Nielsen sealed her victory.
This was the third loss in the Elite League season for Adam Keefe, who, despite his initial loss on Friday night, won 2-1 against Dundee in Belfast.
Both teams met for the fourth time this season – the first three games won by the Giants.
Dwyer's opening goal fell in the fourth minute (3:35) after assisting Kendall McFaull. Four minutes later, Beauvillier doubled the score thanks to assisting David Rutherford.
After the intense opening at 13:10 minute Sullivan introduced the host team back to the game, and then Matt Marquardt equalized the score at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' advantage before the first break, when at the end of the first third he scored his second goal that evening.
The host team was regrouped and Bouchard scored again the goal scored during the lead in the 27:37 minute.
At the end of the second quarter, Cowna and Charles Corcoran together helped Nielsen give Dundee the first lead in the match. The final victory of Dundee was sealed in the last half of the third by the same player who scored a fifth goal for his second.
The giants, who have lost their last five games four, will play the next game on Friday at Milton Keynes.
Air Traffic Controller Kills, Helping Hundreds of People On Airplane Escape from Earthquake
A Indonesian air traffic controller was yelled at by a hero after he died, helping to safely take off the plane with hundreds of people on board.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are considered missing after a major earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
There are still strong secondary shocks in the area, and many people have been imprisoned in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled, saving his life, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave a position in the shattered flight control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained there to ensure that the airline Batik Air (flight number 6321), which was just on the start track, could take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the tower when it seemed to him that he was going to crash.
He died in the hospital.
According to Australian ABC News, Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the controller’s decision was likely to have saved hundreds of lives.
We arranged a helicopter from Balikpapan to Borneo to transfer it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, Anthony left this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“This message has broken our hearts,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach thousands, and the National Disaster Reduction Agency reports that access to the cities of Donggala, Siga and Boutong is limited.
“We believe that the death toll continues to increase, as many bodies are still under gravel and cannot be reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
The six-metre tsunami wave destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral of the victims will take place on Sunday.
Military and civilian aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Ambulances are constantly importing bodies.
There is a lack of drinking water.
Small shops are flattened.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we don’t know what to stop there.
It’s already a tragedy, and it could be even worse.”
On Sunday, Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu, speaking to the military: “I ask all of you to work day and night to carry out all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?” reports CNN.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake this year that killed more than 550 people on the island of Lombok.
Air Niugini plane crash in Micronesia — Air Niugini Airlines reports that one person is missing after the plane crashed in the lagoon
Airlines operating the flight, which crashed in the lagoon of Micronesia in the Pacific, reported that one person was missing. Previously, it was claimed that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini reported that, according to Saturday afternoon data, it was not possible to identify a single man who was travelling by ferial plane.
They said that together with local authorities, hospitals and investigators, they were trying to find him.
However, they did not immediately respond to requests for additional details regarding the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
After the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at the airport on Chuuk Island, local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew members.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six more passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
It is unclear what caused the disaster, and its exact course is unknown.
The U.S. airline and navy say the plane landed in the lagoon near the landing track.
According to some witnesses, he fell off the belt.
The American passenger, Bill Jaynes, said the plane went very low.
“It helped us a lot,” he said.
Jaynes said that he and other people managed to break through the water coming into the belt to exit the emergency plane.
According to him, the crew members panicked and shouted, and he himself suffered a dangerous head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that the rescue was also assisted by sailors who were working nearby to modernize the coast. With the help of a blown boat they were able to transport people to the shore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 meters.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network database in the last two decades, 111 people have died in the disasters of aircraft belonging to the airline registered in Papua New Guinea.
Analyst Reconstructs Events From Night When Woman Was Burned Alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor’s office ended the trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett has testified for hours as a prosecutor in the field of information analysis.
He described the judges as using cell phone records to recreate the route of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
As reported by Clarion Ledger newspaper, Rowlett said he had obtained location data from various cell phones, which showed that on the ferial evening Tellis was from Chambers.
When the data confirmed that while Quinton was supposed to be with his friend, Michael Sanford, according to the testimony, his cell phone was at Jessice Chambers, the police decided to interrogate Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford testified that he was not in the city that day.
Asked by prosecutors whether Tellis was telling the truth, claiming that he was in the Sanford truck that night, the prosecutor replied that “he was lying because my truck was in Nashville at the time.”
Another inaccuracy is Tellis' claim that he had known Chambers for about two weeks.
Cell phone records showed that they had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers Tellis died, she removed her contact details, as well as text messages and calls from her phone.
“He wiped it out of his life,” Hale said.
The final defense talk is set to begin on Sunday.
The judge said that it is likely that the case will be handed over to the jury on the same day.
The High Breed – What is conscious hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to change the negative image of the genre, filling their music with a positive message.
According to The High Breed from Bristol, today's hip-hop has deviated from the original political and social content.
The members of the team want to return to its roots and restore the popularity of conscious hip-hop.
Thanks to the work of artists such as Akala and Lowkey, the recent revival of artists such as The Fugees and Common has been observed in the UK.
Another black one?!
New York nurse posts couple for firing after "racist" SMS
A New York-based nanny asks a couple to fire her from her work on a racist background after receiving a misdirected SMS in which the mother of the child complains that she is “another black person.”
The couple denies being racist by comparing the appeal to “scandalism.”
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, was clearly consterned when it turned out that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, who waxed on her first day at work in 2016, was black.
“NIEEE, THE BLACK PERSON,” she wrote in an SMS to her husband.
But instead of sending it to him, she mistakenly sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, when Plasco-Flaxman was aware of the homicide, she "scratched" Giselle Maurice, claiming that the heartless nurse, who is an African-American, had done her duties poorly, and that she would not be able to do so.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for the working day and then sent home by Uber.
She is now demanding compensation for a <0x24>350-a-day waiver multiplied by six months, for which she was originally employed with residency, although she did not sign a contract.
“I want to show them that these things are not done,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple rejected the allegations of racism, claiming that the termination of cooperation with Mrs. Maurice was justified, because after she was insulted, they feared they would not be able to trust her.
“My wife sent her something she wasn’t going to say.
She's not racist.
We're not racists," said Post's husband, Joel Plasco.
“Would you trust your children to the person you have regretted, even if it was a mistake?
Your new-born baby?
Come on, let's go."
Comparing the appeal to “scandal,” Plasco said that his wife gave birth just two months earlier and was in “very difficult situation”.
“You’re going to blow something like that?
It’s not very nice,” added the investment banker.
Although the case in court has not yet ended, public opinion quickly issued a pair of judgments on social media, criticizing her for her behavior and way of thinking.
New letter reveals that publishers of books about Paddington were afraid readers would not feel connected to a failing mission
The author’s daughter, Michael Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the warm reception of the book, says of the letter: “It is difficult to bet on the person who read it for the first time, even before the book was published.
It’s very funny now that we already know what we know about Paddington’s great success.”
She claims that her father, who, before the little plush mice inspired him to write a children's book, worked as a cameraman at the BBC, was certain that his work would be rejected. She also adds that after his death last year, the 60th anniversary of the book's release.
About Paddington, whom she describes as “a very important member of our family,” she says that her father was secretly proud of his success.
“He was a quiet man, he didn’t bow,” he adds.
“But since Paddington seemed very real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who had achieved something—you feel proud of him, though it’s not your merit.
I think Paddington's success was perceived in a way or so.
Although he himself invented and created it, he always gave credit to Paddington himself.”
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone
After landing, her daughter was taken to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life in vain.
“He called over regularly and said it was really bad that he probably wouldn’t get out of it,” said Tanya Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then he called to tell me that Natasha is going to die in two minutes, and I have to say goodbye to her.
I did it anyway.
I said, “Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines that doctors gave her to keep the heart functioning slowly stopped working and were excreted from the body.
She died some time before, and that was the end of everything.
All I could do was sit down and wait, knowing that everything was going on.
I couldn’t cry or scream or cry because I was among the other people.
I really had to stick with it.”
Eventually, Tanya Ednan-Laperouse, who had already mourned the loss of her daughter, boarded with other passengers, unconscious of the suffering she had experienced.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
I had my head down, and my tears floated all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt an overwhelming sympathy for Nada.
I felt that she needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Postcards from women in mourning to help prevent suicides on bridge
Two women, whose loved ones committed suicide, are trying to distract others from the intention of taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place postcards on the Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers where people can get help.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he became depressed, and at the age of 18, he took his life.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she says.
Sharon Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, says her son was a well-promised cook with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew his smile.
They always said that they can clarify every room with it.”
Before his death, however, he resigned from work because he was “in a really black place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother was 11 years old and that’s what he found his brother when he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm still afraid of the domino effect."
Sharon Davis created cards, “to tell people that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if they’re just friends.
“Don’t sit still, talk to someone.”
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, lost her 15-year-old partner Mark shortly after her mother's death.
“He didn’t say anything that he felt sad, sad, or something,” he says.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
At Christmas, he was already in full swing. When the children opened the gifts, he even looked at them."
He says that his death was very painful for them, but they had to deal with it: “It breaks a hole in the family.
He's entertaining us.
But we must continue to live and fight.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs in Italian because the FBI is launching an investigation
“I thought that if we were really able to get what he asked for — a time-limited and limited investigation — maybe we could achieve some unanimity,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was worried that the committee would “be overruled.”
Why did Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want an FBI investigation?
All their reluctance comes from the moment.
Elections to Congress are already in a few weeks — November 6. If, as predicted, Republicans lose them, the chances of selecting a certain person to the highest court in the country significantly decrease.
George W. Bush has already raised a headphone to call Senators and incentivize them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him at the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was the president’s personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI prepares a report?
In the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, there will be a vote.
It is unclear whether Brett Kavanaugh will get at least 50 Senator votes, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the impasse and bring him to the Supreme Court.
Under Kim's administration, the number of refugees from North Korea is declining
According to South Korean lawmaker Kim Jong Un's seven years ago taking power, the number of people fleeing from North Korea to South Korea has fallen.
Citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Unity, Park Byeong-seug said that 1,127 refugees were reported last year and 2,706 in 2011.
According to him, the key factors that influenced the situation are more rigorous controls at the border between North Korea and China, as well as higher rates charged by human traffickers.
Pyongyang has not issued a public statement on the matter.
The vast majority of the refugees from North Korea are ultimately proposed by South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul authorities, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, making it easier to cross it than a strictly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often sends them back to the country by force.
Relations between North and South, which are theoretically still in a state of war, have clearly improved in recent months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang, where they held talks on negotiations on denuclearization, which had previously stood at a dead end.
This took place after the historic meeting of US President Donald Trump with Kim Jong Un in June in Singapore. The outcome of this meeting is a general agreement on the aim of clearing the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the United States of not making progress on the issue.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no certainty about our national security, and in these circumstances there is no possibility that we will be the first to unilaterally disarm ourselves,” Ri said in a speech before the UN General Assembly.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh a “hysterical” and says he is unsuitable for work in the Supreme Court
Minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh a "hysterical" and said he is not naturally fit to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the statement during an interview she gave during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin on Saturday.
"I think if a woman behaved in this way, she would be considered a 'hysterical'," Pelosi said of her response to the testimony that Kavanaugh made before the Senate Justice Commission on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of alleged sexual harassment by Dr. Christina Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
During his initial speech, Kavanaugh showed strong emotions—almost screaming and losing his speech when discussing family and high school issues.
He also clearly won the Democrats from the commission, outlining the allegations on him of a “grotesque and coordinated attack on the reputation” organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh’s testimony showed that he was not fit to work in the Supreme Court because it revealed his prejudices against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself by making these statements, as well as by the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats,” she said.
Asked if she would try to revoke Kavanaugh from office if he was nominated and if the Democrats won the majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi hesitated.
“If he doesn’t tell Congress or the FBI the truth, he should not only sit in the Supreme Court, but also serve in the court he is currently working in,” she said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the District Court of Appeal in the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible rulings on the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade trial, as he is considered a conservative judge.
During the confirmation trial, Kavanaugh ignored questions as to whether he would overturn some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
“This is not the time to bring a hysterical, predicted person to court who will expect us to say, ‘But it’s wonderful,’” Pelosi said.
And women have to control it.
It's the right diatribe, the months and years of sheer fury, and she can't throw it away without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Gloria Steinem told me 45 years later.
“It’s quite common, isn’t it?”
She added: “A woman who was a manager at a company helped me a lot. She said she was crying when she was angry, but she invented a way that when she gets nervous and starts crying, she says to the person she thinks she’s crying,
I'm angry."
And he keeps doing his thing.
I thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are permissible as a way out of anger in part because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my most obvious memories of one of the first posts in a man-dominated office is how I once began to cry with inexpressible rage. A certain older woman — a cold-looking boss — who was always afraid of me.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad, and they're happy they've taken care of you."
Patricia Schroeder of the Democratic Party, then deputy to Congress from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught with a lover on a boat called Monkey Business and retired from the race, frustrated to the limits Patricia realized she could actually consider the idea of self-candidate for president.
“It wasn’t a thoughtful decision,” she told me, laughing, 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the election and the last thing they needed was another.
Some people have described this situation as ‘The Snow Queen and the Seven Scouts’.
As the campaign had been going on for a long time, Schroeder had a backlog of fundraising and promised herself that she would not join the race if she did not raise <0x24>2 million.
It was a battle sentenced to loss.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who gave men <0x24>1,000, had only 250 for her.
“Do they think I have any discounts?” she wondered.
During her speech in which she announced that she was not going to run a formal campaign, she was so full of emotions — thanks to those who supported her, frustration because of the system that made it so difficult for her to raise money, and not to go to the polls.
“You might think I’ve gone through a nervous breakdown,” the press said.
“You might think Kleenex is sponsoring me.
I remember wondering what they would write on my grave.
"She was crying?"
What Benefits the Economic War Between the United States and China Can Bring to Beijing
The clashes that started the US-China economic war were overwhelming, and while the battle is still ongoing, the conflict between these countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
The first warning was fired this year by U.S. President Donald Trump, imposing tariffs on key Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation occurred this week after the introduction of new tariffs on goods worth <0x24>200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), which resulted in taxing half of all goods flowing to the US from China.
Each time, Beijing retreated in nature, raising tariffs on U.S. goods worth <0x24>60 billion from five to ten percent.
China is determined to respond to every U.S. strike, and it does not appear that the world’s second economy is about to retreat.
Forcing Washington to step down means accepting requests, but a public head-to-head leaning towards the United States would be too shy for President Xi Jinping.
But experts say if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressure from the U.S. trade war could in the long run strengthen China by reducing dependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision taken in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for economic chaos in one of the countries is in fact much more dangerous than has been acknowledged by the Security Center so far,” she said in a statement.
According to foreign minister, Syria is “ready” for the return of refugees
The government says Syria is ready for the voluntary return of refugees, and it is asking for help in rebuilding the country that has been devastated by the more than seven-year war.
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moual said that conditions in the country are improving.
“The situation in our territory is now more stable and safe thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
In an effort to restore normality, the government is constantly rebuilding areas destroyed by terrorists.
All the conditions have already been met so that refugees who had to leave the country due to terrorism and unilateral economic shifts aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods can voluntarily return to it.
According to UN estimates, more than 5.5 million people have left Syria since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people who still live there need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be happy to accept aid in rebuilding the destroyed country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept the aid offered by the countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe seals victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the US team with a score of 16.5 to 10.5 on the Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris.
The United States has lost for the sixth time in a row and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the trophy when under the leadership of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, it scored 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who did not go well for most of the tournament, hit the baseball straight into the water at the 16th round of PAR3, giving the match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has been sparkling through all rounds and has been one of four players since 1979, the first time this tournament took place in the current format, he has managed to score 5-0-0.
American Jordan Spieth was eliminated with a score of 5&4 by the lowest-ranked player from Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who occupies the highest position in the world rankings, lost two laps ahead of the last lap against Englandman Ian Poulter, for whom it may have been the last Ryder Cup tournament.
The European with the largest number of wins in the Ryder Cup was the Spanish Sergio García, who had already participated in eight such tournaments and had 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t stop today.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for believing in me and choosing me.
I’m very happy to get the cup back.
It’s the success of the whole team and I’m happy that I was able to help,” Garcia said excitedly after winning the team from Europe.
He handed the bat to his cousin, John Rahm, who on Sunday defeated a single American golf legend, Tiger Woods, with a 2&1 score.
“I feel an incredible pride in winning with Tiger Woods. I grew up watching his game,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all matches in France and now has 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup.
This is an unprecedented statistic, as one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 of the most important titles and left only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had trouble finding the runners-up all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at a really high level throughout the tournament.
After a disappointing performance by his captain, Jim Furyk, he said: “I’m proud of the boys, they fought.
At some point this morning, we pressed some Europeans.
We've retired.
Hats off in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played really well.
We will change the composition of the group. Together with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission, we will find a way to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
I'm full of admiration for the opponents.
They played much better than us.”
