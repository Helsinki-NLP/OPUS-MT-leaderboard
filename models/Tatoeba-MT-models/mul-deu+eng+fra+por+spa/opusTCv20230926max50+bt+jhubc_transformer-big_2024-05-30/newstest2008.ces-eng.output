Inflation in Europe has jumped due to food
The accelerating inflation in the euro area is mainly due to the constant increase in food prices.
Price growth in November in 13 euro area countries was higher than expected, after 2.6 per cent in October, an annual inflation of 3.1 per cent, the Luxembourg Statistical Office of the Union said.
The official forecast was only 3 percent, Bloomberg said.
Unlike the U.S., British and Canadian issuers, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the basic interest rate in that the decline, along with rising commodity prices and declining unemployment, would lead to a spiral of inflation.
The ECB would like to keep the inflation rate below 2 percent, but close to it.
According to one of the analysts, the ECB is in an absurd situation: it has to "delete" inflation so that it does not have to do anything about it later on.
In Germany, November inflation stands at a record 3.3 per cent for 15 years; in Spain, it rose from 3.6 per cent to 4.1 per cent.
Inflation in the euro area has slipped upwards due to sharply rising food and energy prices.
Wheat prices have risen by 88 percent, and soybean prices have reached their highest value since 1973.
Similarly, in 2007 it was necessary to pay significantly more for edible oil and dairy products.
The price of oil on the world markets rose by 52 percent this year, and last month it was worth one barrel of black gold almost <0x24>100.
According to the ECB, inflation will jump from 2.1 per cent this year to 2.5 per cent in 2008, but will fall to 1.9 per cent in 2009.
According to analysts, the 12-month inflation rate will remain around 3% in the next 3-4 months, but its average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to immediately double its interest rates during 2008.
Gallup Sees a Government Crisis
The circle of supporters of the Fidesz movement after the prolonged stagnation increased significantly in early December, so it now has the largest camp since 2002, while in the case of the Gallup Institute socialists it has never measured such a low - 13% support.
In the case of certain party voters, the difference - due to the greater determination of the opposition voters - represented more than two-thirds (71 percent) of support against the five-year support of the CFSP.
According to the survey, MDF and CSDP are below the threshold for access to parliament: their support within the entire population is 2%.
Among certain party voters, the supporters of both camps are 1% more.
The public's view of the economy has also deteriorated due to the previous minimum - the ratio of those who consider the country's economic situation to be very bad, so high - 41 percent, while the other 46 percent say the situation is quite bad.
Families are now more pessimistic about the change in their material situation after spring and summer more hopeful outlooks.
As for next year, most of the population is expected to deteriorate further and only a dozen will improve.
In December, 71 percent of the respondents, most of the Gallup Institute’s surveys to date, judged that the prime minister is doing his job poorly rather than well.
Ferenci Gyurcsány believes or very believes 13% of the respondents, while Viktor Orbán’s share of supporters is 38%.
Fidesz is not believed by 54 percent, Fidesz is not believed by 27 percent.
One of the indicators of the development of the political situation is how much of the public believes that dissatisfaction with the prime minister can be solved without changing the government.
While the government and prime minister’s stay were considered desirable after last October’s unrest, it is now only 20 percent, with a relative majority (33 percent) seeing the solution only in the drafting of new elections.
For interest in the referendum, it is significant that 60 percent of respondents answered a question about their possible participation, that the referendum would certainly come and another 20 percent said it would likely come.
By comparison, "parliamentary elections held this Sunday" would certainly take part only 55 percent and the other 15 percent consider their participation to be probable. The success of the referendum would be undeniable on the basis of current intentions.
The school would say no to 74, the doctor’s fees to 79 and the hospital stay fees to 84 percent.
If we look at the same shares only in the circle of people who certainly promise to participate, then the introduction of tuition, doctor fees and hospital stay fees would be rejected by 81, 84 and 89 percent.
The most expensive is Auchan, almost one-fifth of which Tesco is irritated.
Hypermarkets in the Buda trading triangle maintained last year, an average of 16 percent increase in price levels, with the difference that there was no VAT increase this year.
Article in the journal Daily Economy
The usual Christmas shopping basket of the Napi Gazda<0xC5><0x9F> newspaper in the Budapest business triangle grew by an average of 16 percent this year, however, in all hypermarkets there was an increase in the price notably above a thousand forints.
Since prices in supermarkets of food "flew out" in December last year, the percentage of the previous high base did not show such drastic irritation.
But it is certainly unpleasant for consumers that what they could safely buy for less than nine thousand forints last year will not be worth even ten thousand.
The Daily Economy basket in the researched hypermarkets exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand forints by at least 91 forints.
The highest price of the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003, the consumption basket was 6,800 forints.)
The price of Unica and live fish has remained almost at last year’s level, however very irritated by the harsh breasts, nuts and also beans.
The prices of bread and flour corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office, although we found a kilogram of bread in Auchan for 139 forints.
The competition did not go with the price of the product below 200 forints.
Similarly, it was surprising in this store that the price of a two-volt Coca-Cola in a return bottle was below 200 forints, so even with the backup the product cost only 257 forints.
However, this year, according to the Napi Gazda<0xC5><0x9F> Auchan newspaper, it appeared as the most expensive, while Cora appeared as the cheapest.
According to our calculations, prices in the consumer basket of the Napi Gada<0xC5><0x9F><0xC4><0x81>g newspaper rose by 15 per cent from last year’s Christmas Cora prices, while Tesco and Auchan rose by about 18 per cent.
Compared to last year’s highest and this year’s lowest consumption basket values, the difference was 12 percent, while growth between last year’s lowest and this year’s highest is 21%.
Forints averaged an increase of 1,480.
The average increase in prices last year amounted to 1,206 forints, with prices on Christmas last year being influenced by the increase in VAT.
It was this process that reversed the trade, and commercial houses were obviously unable to decide how large the price ranges should be set for each product, as they were unable to predict the impact of the change in prices on consumption.
(If a trader plans the speed of circulation of a given product badly, a significant profit may be lost due to the price range adapted to the intensity of circulation.)
Due to VAT, last year’s rise in the price of the Napi Gazdaság daily basket was so extreme that the price of the most expensive basket was 1,720 forints higher than in 2006, while the lowest one made a price difference of 844 forints everywhere.
This year there was no extreme difference, the most expensive basket was now worth 1,630 forints more than last year and also the cheapest one was irritated by 1,284 forints.
Compared to the two Christmas seasons, the price increase was catastrophic and in less than 20 months, the daily consumption of goods in hypermarkets increased by more than 30 percent.
(This is not absolutely confirmed by the Central Statistical Office’s data: the Central Statistical Office measured a price increase of more than 30 percent over the course of 12 months in the case of several basic foods.
In addition to eggs, for example.)
In the latter case, however, according to the Daily Economy consumer basket, this seems almost impossible, as the price level of the product, which was quite expensive already last year, showed a price increase of just over 10 per cent, even in the worst case.
Milk suppliers seem to be taking a stronger position than egg suppliers, and they have managed to achieve drastic price increases even in international chains.
Hypermarkets in the commercial gold triangle do not complain, still report a good year.
According to our experience, most customers in the three stores visited are no longer interested in prices.
They buy everything in quantity, they take lasting food after the plates.
On Wednesday morning, there were long fronts at the Treasury in all three supermarkets, as the number of visitors increased sharply.
However, as we know, there is a lower turnover in the countryside, and more international chains complain to research firms that sales are behind their plans, not only for food, but also for sustainable consumer goods.
In many places it saves on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand cases of infections have been reported in hospitals, mainly due to the inappropriate use of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, the overloading of beds, the overload of the staff stopping the disease do not help, says the prime minister of the National Epidemiological Center.
In many places it also saves on disinfectants.
Recently, MRSA infection was diagnosed in the traumatic department of St. John's Hospital.
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria have been discovered in a man who got to the hospital after a serious traffic accident.
The patient was isolated.
Similar infections occurred in the same place at the beginning of the year.
The patient injured in a serious car accident was released home, however, soon afterwards he had to return with MRSA infection and due to the bacteria in his body, no major surgery could be performed.
By December 10, the National System of Nesocomialis Surveillance reported 1,094 hospital infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens, said Karolina Böröczová, associate of the National Epidemiological Center.
This means that so many infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens have been safely registered in hospitals, others are not known.
Nearly two-thirds (683) of infections were caused by MRSA, or methicillin-oxacilline resistant golden staphylococcus.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria carries one-third of the people in the nose without causing disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. cervical inflammation, almond inflammation, skin infections, early infections) respond well to antibiotics and can be treated well.
However, if antibiotics are administered excessively or inappropriately, a bacteria that responds well to antibiotics develops, which is highly resistant to antibiotics and which spreads rapidly in inappropriate hospital conditions.
Especially in the case of temporary or permanent malfunction of the immune system in patients with weakened body, low body weight or in patients over the years can cause serious hospital infections, such as an accidental infection or blood poisoning - sepsis.
According to the top doctor of St. John's Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, similar infections in hospitals are part of daily practice.
"Infection should not be confused with epidemic, MRSA is not only there," said Tibor Nyulasi, "where the presence of the originator of the disease is not investigated."
Resistant to antibiotics
“We are isolating these patients, treating them with rubber gloves and masks, and we have the necessary antibiotics to treat them,” said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients admitted to the hospital are first examined to see whether MRSA is present in their body, however, infection can not always be avoided.
Sampling is not in fashion
The vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, however, current conditions and conditions in domestic hospitals are not favorable for the prevention of the development and spread of multi-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröczová.
Since this infection occurs symptomatically in hospitals and hospitals for the elderly, hospital admissions should be monitored and MRSA carriers should be isolated immediately.
However, the collection of microbiological samples in Hungarian hospitals is not fashionable.
The fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not finance these investigations also plays a role.
Most cases are so revealed when the patient suffers from a perceptible MRSA infection, the primary care center said.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the appropriate treatment of antibiotics in the field of human medicine and there are also domestic directives for the treatment of individual infections, diseases.
It is necessary to endeavour to target antibiotic therapy or to conduct microbiological examinations to prevent the development of resistance to drugs, although hospitals do not in all cases comply with it.
Samples of microbiological samples are even more rare for basic and ambulatory treatment of patients, Karolina Böröczová said.
Saves on disinfectants
According to scientific evidence, MRSA is most often spread among patients through healthcare professionals.
Therefore, it plays a very important role in hand washing and the use of gloves and masks, however, there are serious shortcomings in hospitals as well.
MRSA is transmitted by capella infection and touch, but in hospital conditions it is not always possible to isolate infected patients.
On the contrary, the rooms are often crowded, the beds are often very close to each other, although from an epidemiological point of view, patients should be at least 1.5 meters away from each other.
As Karolina Böröczová noted, unfortunately, we can also encounter the fact that in hospitals that are in an unfavorable material situation, saving on disinfectants, nurses are few and patients a lot, there is a chance of infection from the infection.
According to Karolina Böröczová, where the necessary protective measures are observed, similar infections are demonstrably less or the further spread of the cause of the disease can be stopped.
Government Programme against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection is a huge expense for health insurance companies, which is why it is fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has written the MRSA prevention programme, and the reduction of its incidence.
Apparently, the program is successful, according to published data, MRSA infections in England are showing a declining trend.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) ranks the prevention of multiple resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and hospital infections caused by these pathogens among its priorities.
The police officer who caused the fatal accident was not drunk.
The official expert assessment in the case of the Police Captain of District XXII, who caused the fatal accident, is completed.
It can be ruled out that the police captain of District XXII, who killed a pedestrian on Tuesday and who in the meantime resigned from his position, was driving under the influence of alcohol or narcotic drugs, a spokesman for the Upper State Department of the capital Attila Morvai reported.
The expert’s assessment confirmed the result of the original investigation, which had already found that the former police captain had not consumed any alcohol before he sat behind the wheel.
The then director of the police department of District XXII crashed on Tuesday in Lajose Kossutha Street in District XXII by his own personal car while bending the fifty-year-old man who entered before him while crossing the road outside the marked crossing.
(The latter being the fact that the pedestrian was passing outside the zebra, by the way, according to the road rules, is not a mitigating circumstance, the reversing car must still give priority.)
After being transported to the hospital, the pedestrian died.
As a result of these events, the District Police Director resigned and requested a transfer to the service, according to the police report because he was so shocked in the case.
The case is being investigated by the Budapest State Prosecutor’s Office.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police captain had cooperated with state prosecutors conducting the investigation from the outset.
Another <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million for infrastructure
The agreement on three credit frameworks of a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure as well as energy was signed in Budapest on Friday by Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice President of the European Investment Bank (EIB).
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million framework for financing Hungary’s transport and environmental projects under the Cohesion Fund’s support, with a loan agreement of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 million already used by the parties, which has signed a loan agreement of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million per part.
A loan agreement of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million is also used to finance projects related to education.
The EIB has approved a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million for Hungary for these purposes, the remaining <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million may be used later, with the extension of the credit agreement.
In the area of innovation, the parties signed a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 million contract, which will be used primarily for the research and development project of the University of Debrecen.
There was also a talk about the 4th metro route.
The parties agreed that after Hungary agrees with the EU on the details of the financing of the subway, it will return to whether and how the original contract should be modified.
This could happen in the first quarter of 2008, according to János Veres.
Since 1990, the EIB has funded a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8.4 billion in 113 projects in Hungary.
The interest on the loans provided by the EIB with an eight-year waiting period and no commitment fee is bound to the EURIBOR rate.
Bulgaria is the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is astonishing - the attention of all of Europe is turning to a previously somewhat neglected Balkan country.
What, where and who is buying the most inexpensive yet fast-growing EU market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
One of the most sought after destinations in Eastern Europe for real estate purchases is undoubtedly Bulgaria with its cheap ski apartments and houses on the sea coast.
From the mountains are the most in the course of the area Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vito<0xC5><0xA1>a, on the sea coast then Albena, Golden Sands, Sunny Coast, the ancient cities of Sozopol and Nesebar, however more and more people are looking for properties in the surroundings of Kavarna and Bal<0xC4><0x8D>i.
According to analysts from Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later the central part of the country – for example Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna – will be attracting investors, and more and more interested people are also shopping in the vicinity of the cheap city of Ruse.
Also the capital Sofia is a promise of attractive possibilities, business and office spaces promise the highest returns.
Bulgaria is on its best course to become one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe, making it next to the summer and winter seasons a destination for travel even in the next two seasons.
Foreseeable investors are already shopping in large areas, for example in the area of Banska.
According to analysts, real estate buyers in Bulgaria are also trying to change their life and lifestyle.
Most customers come from England, however they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and more often also from Romania.
There are also Maltese and Cypriot investors, along the Black Sea and in the ski resorts there are traditionally many Russian customers.
Foreign buyers will be divided into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Emerging people buy either renovated properties worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50-100 thousand, or detached old houses for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5-15 thousand, which are then renovated.
They require good accessibility and communication options, it is important for them the proximity of a large city, shops and usually a local doctor.
The second category is chat buyers (Bulgaria ranks among the top 10 German holiday destinations in December).
The third group consists of commercial investors who buy in hopes of rising value in the medium to long term.
Real estate depreciation in the capital is continuous, as demand is growing more and more strongly.
In Bulgaria, real estate prices are the lowest in the European Union, but in the last five years they have grown by 21% annually.
The increase in real estate prices significantly outweighs the growth in wages.
Fodor and the Hungarian 6%
According to information from the Minister of Environment and Water Gabor Fodor, the meeting of experts will be closed on Tuesday and after Wednesday’s official start, the international conference on the climate regime after 2012 will continue with ministerial talks.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are discussing the Bali Roadmap, which addresses efforts following a period of emission reduction defined by the Kyoto Protocol in force until 2012.
At this point, there is a stormy debate between the developing and the developed countries.
The United States has also announced that it now does not want to deal with exact figures, although it is adhering to an agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 as compared to 1990.
Another major issue of the conference is whether developed countries will, in addition to reducing emissions, agree to provide both material and technological assistance to the countries referred to it.
The agreement also included subsidies for developing countries.
The grant fund, set out in the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by a 16-member Governing Council, probably within the framework of the World Environment Programme (WFP) at the United Nations - we can read in the journal Piac és Profit.
6% of Hungarians
On behalf of Hungary, the Minister for the Environment and Water Affairs Gábor Fodor supports the EU’s efforts to maintain a leading role in global climate protection efforts and to support the creation of a new international agreement by 2009.
The minister said that the EU is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels, regardless of the success of the adoption of the "post-2012 agreement", and is ready to commit to a 30% reduction in their feasibility in the event that the greenhouse gas emissions will be reduced from the rest of the country and from the rest of the country.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the countries that acceded to the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 had set a target of 5.2 per cent reduction, with the then 15 EU Member States committing themselves to 8 per cent.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent compared to 1985-87, which our country will fulfill. - recalls the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
In Bali, this is a lot, because in two years it is only necessary to adopt an international agreement on long-term climate change policy, otherwise its entry into force would certainly not have moved until 2012. In this case, the climate commitments set by the Kyoto Protocol would not be more climate-reducing,they would not immediately be tied to their system of emi-ration.
This would lead to a delay in reducing emissions and an inevitable increase in the average temperature on Earth by more than 2 degrees Celsius, which according to scientists would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
The British Army is hiring on YouTube
British military units are publishing videos of events in Iraq and Afghanistan on a shared server, which they are promoting themselves.
YouTube was first favored by the British Air Force (RAF): special forces operating in Afghanistan have been recording videos of actions against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC said.
The recordings, taken by a miniature camera attached to the helmet, are checked by the Air Force Command Command controlling combat operations in the Kandahar area and then sent further to London, where they are transmitted to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable.
In this form, 139 recordings of British air forces have already been made on the Internet, and more than 75,000 people have been watching their "channel".
The British Ministry of Defence registered in the spring of 2007 as a "defenceheadquarters" and publishes footage of events in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and the International Peace Units in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channels.
Settlement in Afghanistan
The air forces have released videos according to their original intent for recruitment and according to the Ministry of Defence, they are also good at making the general public aware of the true goal of the army’s presence abroad.
"Propaganda published in this form is almost nothing compared to traditional television recruitment ads," said defense expert Gordon Mackenzie, "but it necessarily also carries a certain political message in itself, because the special form of the adverts confirms that they are not."
The Americans did the game.
The army is concerned that, in addition to carefully edited, censored recordings, amateur videos are also received on the server, for example, capturing the death of soldiers: in some hypocritical, "official" promotional films, the officers will talk about the most blood, not losing.
On the internet, by the way, there were already many videos from the fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, which were formed during the sharp deployment, but the British army has only arrived on them now.
Americans perform the hiring a little differently - using a shooting game called America's Army, which is free to download and in which the player can get directly into the skin of soldiers through a more or less loyal simulation.
At the ministries there will be Christmas with tombolo and paychecks
The Minister of Labour Monika Lamperthová is not sentimental: instead of Christmas party, she organizes for her colleagues a final workshop, where she will say goodbye to her paychecks and coffee in 2007.
In some ministries there will be a celebration with live music, elsewhere will enchant officials with the Christmas atmosphere with a tombole and an appetizer.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and a Swedish table - that's how you enjoy the power.
State authorities are also preparing for Christmas.
The most expensive ministerial Christmas celebration this year is organized by the Ministry of Defence, however, it is not expected by its employees.
On Christmas orphans are given gifts to the children of fallen soldiers, at Mission Christmas hosts family members of the soldiers, currently serving on foreign missions, but they also organize a reception for journalists.
The resort spends <0x24>25 million on the atmosphere at the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (NF<0xC3><0x9C>) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) are throwing themselves out of the fold compared to other resorts.
The GKM celebration is held in the centre of Jöt<0xC5><0x91> Háza, for a total of 4,320.000 forints and of the six hundred employees of the ministry is expected to have about three hundred and fifty guests.
The resort will hold Christmas traditions at its celebration, but there will also be various performances and will also be played tombola.
Christmas NF<0xC3><0x9C> cost 4,700,000 forints and took place on Wednesday in the building of the State Judicial Council (OIT) - concerts and dinners were on the program.
The rent of the hall cost a million forints, the rest was spent on more than four hundred invited.
One department of NF<0xC3><0x9C> seems to be invited to another Christmas celebration: this is where the tendering company, the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development (MAG) is organised.
For this purpose, they rented the Vígszínház theatre building.
MAG a. s. has not confirmed this information because we have failed to reach the relevant person.
Clothes are not needed
The ILO building hosted not only the NF<0xC3><0x9C>, but also the Ministry of Justice and Security, which instead of Christmas held the St. Lucia Ball on 7 December.
However, the OIT did not want money from him using its halls.
Five hundred people participated in the dance.
The Minister of Health started the evening, after dinner, it was possible to dance with live music.
According to the answer to the question of the portal [origo] at the dance were not compulsory evening dresses or dresses at all.
The Puritan Party is being organised by health resorts, labor and local municipalities.
The Ministry of Health organizes a program and celebration for employees for 400,000 forints in its own building.
The Minister of Labor Monika Lampert’s colleagues are not even officially invited to a Christmas party, but to a final working meeting.
There are one hundred and eighty guests who, according to the press department, will only receive coffee and pajamas, so only 350,000 forints will be enough for the party.
The Minister of Local Self-Government Gordon Bajnai and his colleagues are simply drinking in the hall of the Ministry of Local Self-Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) is organizing a Christmas meeting, at which it expects 436 workers, in its own large hall.
For the Christmas party he devotes 2,500 forints per guest - the total amount includes a reception with Swedish tables and a drink.
Since being the minister of János Veres, the PM’s employees have been celebrating Christmas in a similar way every year.
However, the atmosphere of the party will be lacking, the officiality intensifies not only the ministerial speech, but also the afternoon time of the meeting.
The agriculture resort will host a New Year’s reception on January 20, there will be no ministerial Christmas.
The reception will take place at Vajdahunyadvar Castle in Mestské sets and according to the Ministry's announcement, it is allocated 1,000 forints per person to one hundred guests.
According to the press department, it will be a very simple reception, to which only the relevant foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary are invited.
These annual receptions start with a brief health minister and end with a small discharge.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not organise Christmas parties at all, the relevant press department told the portal [origo].
The award of the Christmas celebrations of the environmental resort in the press department were not able to communicate.
In any case, four hundred people were invited to the party held in the Museum of Fine Arts.
He's heading for a giant strike.
The League trade unions association and the National Union of Workers’ Councils (MOSZ) will set up their strike committee on Friday to coordinate Monday’s unlimited strike.
On Saturday, a protest public assembly is held, and on Monday - the day of the final vote on the health insurance law - work will be halted.
The action will certainly cause a serious interruption of traffic, as railways will almost completely stop and by 13 hours, employees of the Budapest Transport Company (BKV) will also strike.
On Friday afternoon, the League Association together with the National Federation of Workers’ Councils will meet with details of Monday’s jointly organized strike.
There will also be a LIGA – MOSZ strike committee, which will coordinate Monday’s event.
A public protest rally is taking place on Saturday, and from Monday, trade unions joining the strike will stop working indefinitely if there is no agreement with the government.
This means that no deadline has been set for the end of the strike, which will begin on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act.
If Parliament did not finally pass the Health Insurance Act, the trade unions would immediately withdraw the call for strikes.
However, if the legislation is repealed, the strike committee will meet and decide on the next procedure.
According to the Monday agenda of Parliament's meeting, it is also possible that the Health Insurance Act will only be voted late in the evening or at night, if any.
Due to the strike that starts on Monday, it is possible to count on severe interruptions of traffic: work on the railway will be stopped for an indefinite period, part of Budapest’s public transport can be stopped in the morning and more than half of the company Volán.
At the same time, half of the road will be closed in many places of the country.
A number of trade unions and civil organisations have joined the call for strikes, the list of which is constantly updated on the League’s website.
Some organizations have announced an indefinite strike, while others have announced a temporary cessation of work.
By Thursday afternoon, the Hungarian State Railways (MAV) and the Independent Trade Union of Railway Employees (ICEF) were unable to agree on sufficient services, while at the beginning of Christmas holidays, the railway travels more and more.
According to the announcements so far, from the start of operation until 13 hours, strike will be held at BKV, from 7 am to 9 am at Budapest Airport, a four-hour strike will be organised by the trade unions of workers in the energy industry of the LIGA, to the 2-, 2-8-hour peborgog peborz and Deborgog<0xC4><0x85>d<0xC4><0x85>da<0xC4><0x8D>
The Hungarian Association of Doctors will strike in exchange across the country, the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers (EDDSZ), which belongs to the Cooperation Forum of Trade Unions (SZEF), is organizing a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands formulated by the League's association is that the government withdraw its proposal for health insurance reform and present a new concept for public discussion.
The second requirement is that a new method of counting pensions, which will be effective from next year, be introduced gradually.
Thirdly, in the case of early retirement for the relevant sectors, the possibility of inclusion in the system already before 2010 is ensured.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Independent Trade Union of Railway Employees (IGEC), which is part of the League trade union, does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economy and Transport relating to railway branches, and expects a different offer.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guards Risk Increased Country
The activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded with the support of the Jobbik Magyarzá<0xC5><0x99>ár movement in August this year, according to the Risk Analysis Division (Risk Analysis Division) of the Institute Political Capital increased the political risk of Hungary and the entire region in several respects.
The company’s “Alert to Risks” states that, in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is that “by ignoring the already existing ethnic tension between the Roma and non-Roman populations of Hungary” it may be possible to get in touch with the Hungarians in the near future.
The main reason is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is likely to provoke such an action, the research institute said.
As he writes, all this can be explained by one of the greatest negligences of Hungarian political leaders: "the public discussion of the Roma issue was left by the public life to representatives of radical and extremist political groups who could take on the Roma-Hungarian political strategism."
This problem deepens, hinders normal dialogue, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activities of the Hungarian Guard have "significantly damaged Hungary's image abroad, especially with regard to faith in the stability of the country and its democratic development".
The Institute recalls that as part of the reorganization of the Hungarian radical and ultraright groups, which has been gaining ever-increasing publicity and vehemence since the fall of 2006, several organisations have been created in Hungary since the summer of 2007, which themselves are called "national defence associations".
"The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civil associations, while openly reporting - and armed - the readiness of their members to carry out defensive tasks (in case of life-threatening disasters), not attacking the state, attacking the state, violating the order, or violating the order.
He further notes: all this is done in a way that tries to wrap the various political efforts built on society’s resistance to politics and parties into civilian clothing.
The emphasis on civility and the form of the association, therefore, in the case of these groups, serves not only to avoid legal constraints on judicial registration, but is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are an increasing risk factor also in terms of neighbouring relations.
“In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been referred to as a potential source of danger in several neighbouring countries, ultranationalist political leaders of some neighbouring countries wanting to apologize for their own anti-Hungarian politics by appealing for the establishment of the Hungarian Guard.
All this can affect the political stability of the region,” he added.
According to the research institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard in Central and Eastern Europe is not an isolated phenomenon, so the political risks for the region as a whole have increased.
The activities of the Hungarian Guard are similar, for example, to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, which was announced in August 2007 by the ultra-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
Against the background of the formation of the Bulgarian Guard, there are mass Roma riots that erupted in one of the Sofia neighborhoods (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU used this to establish a guard with the organization’s goal being a “national home defense”.
In the past 17 years, according to the report, there has been a “cycanic terror” in Bulgaria, but the state has remained inactive and indifferent, according to the Institute Political Capital.
He adds that the initiative has sparked a stormy discussion with the Bulgarian public.
The rise in the risk of ethnic clashes signals the announcement by some Bulgarian Roma organizations that they will form their own guard in response to the sign of resistance.
Since the activity of the Hungarian Guard shows similarities with the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not excluded that the Hungarian Roma will respond to the threat in a similar way, by establishing their own home defense, we can read in the risk warning drawn up by the Institut Politica.
Attila Juhász, director of research at the Institute of Political Capital, said: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, the risk analysis is issued every year and if they find anything that could affect the change in risk, they inform the public, as in this case by issuing a risk warning.
Holidays are not free everywhere.
In Hungary, holidays are precisely determined by law and it has become a common practice to move around the holidays, which awaits us less in the coming year.
The holidays are not unified in the European Union or in the United States.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between national and national holidays and working days of rest.
Days of work rest are usually linked to church holidays or to significant historical events.
We are also celebrating the New Year: the last day of the old and the first day of the new year is working - for the New Year already so that people can rest after New Year.
During the year, we have 11 free holidays.
The national holiday is March 15 celebrating the revolution of 1848 and October 23, commemorating the revolution of 1956.
On August 20, we celebrate the founding of the state, on May 1st, and on November 1st and 2nd, we commemorate the dead relatives and friends.
In addition, we have two-day holidays of Easter, Anniversary and Christmas.
Since our national, national or religious holidays rarely fall on weekends according to the calendar, it has become a practice of shifting the working day in cases that we would only work one day before or after the holiday.
The price for extended weekends, however, is that we stay in the workplace and in the school on the previous Saturdays.
The day that the holiday immediately precedes or follows, we work out, has been regulated for many years in a special declaration of the Minister of Labour.
The legislation shall apply to the same extent to all employers and employees employed by them, to public servants and to persons in the public service.
However, this does not apply to companies and institutions that are in operation without interruption or operate even on working days of rest.
This year there will be a change in the working order only around the holidays at the end of the year: from December 24, life in the country will almost stop, because, according to the experiences to date, most people "work" the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve in advance or use the savings.
Next year, a few of our holidays will fall right in the middle of the weekend, respectively, so the shifts of the working day will be less than this year.
For the first time, the calendar is transformed around the work holiday so that workers can then stay at home for four days of taste.
Saturday 26th April will be a working day, so Friday 2nd May can be a day of rest.
The next move is related to the holiday of 23 October: on Saturday 18 October will be working instead of Friday 24.
At the end of next year, however, it will be able to take place entirely in the sign of the holidays, because from December 24, they will have almost everywhere nonstop holidays despite the fact that New Year falls on Wednesday.
Six scary little things you can do to annoy your colleagues
Emails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive, innocent lies that we almost never notice: it all "sweeps up" every day at work.
The question is whether you will get used to these little inconveniences, or put on gloves, and the vague situations that may anger others will deliberately avoid.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you they were looking for you from the marketing department," a colleague tells you.
That's why you missed the meeting?
In the better case, she regrets and tries to fix it, or she calls the marketing department and says she forgot to pass the message (this is a less common solution).
Most often, the issue is solved by an apology.
Before embarrassing apologies occur, it is good to think about what you can do to prepare your colleagues for unpleasant moments, and consciously try to prevent it.
Are you borrowing something that is not yours?
There’s nothing more unpleasant than pulling up for some writing, office needs, or for your phone, and they’re not there.
Do you remember last night when you laid a sewing machine on your desk, but it's gone by morning?
Or did you find your pen on the table of one of your colleagues that you thought was lost?
Don’t take anything from your colleagues without permission, otherwise they’ll be angry at you because you’re craving them for things.
Do not carry envelopes or glue papers from the office, as it can be uncomfortable when they happen to you prematurely, and you will need them immediately.
Talk about your colleagues' private life?
There's no good way to stop the spread of clashes.
Who, with whom, what did he do?
Where and why?
Don’t tell everyone about your own personal experiences with your colleagues!
If any of them shares their innermost secrets with you, do not abuse their confidence!
Lock in yourself what you have heard, and in his absence do not discuss it with your colleagues, even when others know about his things.
Are you unreasonably reporting your absence?
If you call the office and call for severe headaches, you report your absence because you are not well, or you say that you would rather rest today, you think that your work, urgent tasks and work that have a certain deadline will have to be done for you.
Take care of your colleagues!
If you know in advance that you’re not going to work the next day, or that something can happen, so you’ll have to stay home, let it know so that your colleagues and managers won’t be confronted with your absence until the second day.
Braiding, braiding, telephone
Have you been immersed in a job where you are roughly ripped off by a colleague’s belt?
Did you unwillingly become a witness to a telephone conversation that would be better not to hear at all?
Do not disturb your co-workers by whispering, chanting, talking loudly (on top of your head), or sneezing, constantly beating, loud dissatisfaction.
All of this can be disruptive even when they are not exactly prevented into a project (writing, planning, organization).
Are you blaming others for their mistakes?
If something is not done in time or you have forgotten to send an important letter or message, do not blame for your forgetfulness of the other!
Do not resort to any chaos in the office and noisy colleagues!
Recognize if you made a mistake and someone paid for it, and fix the damage!
Ask yourself how you can put things in order, make negligence!
Do you feel too at home in your office?
Heels and slippers: comfortable clothing at home, however, does not fit in the office!
Do not wear clothes for your free time, even if your profession allows it!
Don’t be negligent, honor your colleagues and yourself by coming to the office in regular dresses – and if your profession requires it, nice and elegant!
When a man wants to meet, he stops being interesting.
Riding in the usual morning constipation.
A special melody is ringing from the radio: the sound is whispering, to which electronic effects are connected.
I'm adding volume.
The music changes the pace and the bass is added to previous tones, then the female choir joins as a real jewel.
On mr2, Zagar's song is called Wings of Love.
Home music life hasn’t erased us for a long time with high-quality electronic pop.
All of a sudden, however, the constipation looks quite different, because you are just listening to the new album Zagaro.
The apparition of Yonderboie, a couple of new and interesting productions coming from the home digital underground, is slowly changing the overall picture, and although it’s back in fashion, garage rock with its drumming into the guitar, even the home electropop proves that it’s something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in P<0xC4><0x9B>tikostelí and also he played in Yonderboy's band until he finally - perhaps because two dudes don't get into a single spell - went his own way.
However, with his project (Zagar) and music, which combines elements of jazz, electronic dance styles and pop, he began to intertwine only when he was called to compose film soundtracks (e.g.
"Ference" Turkish film "Season").
His formation, initially playing in smaller clubs, became known to a wider audience after wan2 magazine ranked their first album from 2002 among the 50 most important home albums and declared Zagar at Yonderboie as the only domestic entity that could determine the developments that could occur.
Zagar and his band are undoubtedly "in the course", although of course no one asked them if they were satisfied with this sticker.
The band reacted as it belonged: they made a new, better album.
The now released album Cannot Walk Fly Instead can open new paths for them, although the name itself is trying to create a connection with the initial flights in the Five Stars.
It is one of the songs of the old band Balázse Zsagzer.
The reference to the etheric, flying would be in place, but next to the etheric breath of this music now appeared - in line with the spirit, the trend of the time - louder guitar, the influence of rock and roll.
In these songs, singer György Ligeti, currently working in England with the band The Puzzle, was featured at the premiere of the album at Millenáris Park.
The album also produced one real radio hit, thanks to the mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi station, which recently played popular music from morning to evening, we began to tune various melodies of the songs Wings of Love, recorded with six domestic singers ("Underground").
So it's all right (?).
Portal hvg.hu told Balázse Zságera.
hvg.hu: In connection with this new hit, the question is, how much of what you’re playing remains marginal music?
Balázs Zs<0xC4><0x81>ger: The definition of marginal music means nothing to me.
I think there are two different castes of light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even so-called alternative, underground music can be flat, say nothing and just so can be created for sale, which makes it commercial.
However, even a good pop song can derive from a sincere inner need.
In this spirit, the attitude as it is accepted, regardless of language and state borders, also works.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audience to your music?
B. Zs.: In foreign, especially from us to the west, light music has a greater tradition.
There are not only teenagers and people who go to concerts after 20, but also older ones.
Much more are watched by the transformations of light music going around them, as they also consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Do you care who, where, and how many people listen to your music?
B.Z.: Of course, it’s a good feeling that more and more people are going to our concerts.
But we never did music for the market.
Music is not born with a purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the audience can be perceived rather in concerts where mutual influence already works, but it is hidden only in the unnecessary changes of the moment.
Still, I noticed that when a person wants to meet the audience, he stops being interesting from that moment on.
hvg.hu: How much are you going to follow the example of Yonderboie?
He's working solo and he's built his career more to the west than we do.
B. Zs.: Actually, we are not going his way, regardless of how our music is sometimes trying to explain.
We are rather team players who rely on the musical presence of the other and let it evolve.
At first, of course, our work was not to be compared to Yonderboy’s compositions, because a few of us separated from his band and went on a different path.
hvg.hu: In the hottest station mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi, Wings of Love came first.
Many have heard the name Zagar for the first time in connection with this song.
In a more popular style, did you consciously open up to wider layers?
B.Z.: We didn’t plan to write a hit to sell the record.
There's more to this song.
We thought of it as the finale of the album, which we tried to unleash the previous sound orgy and more complex topics.
hvg.hu: How did you choose these six singers?
Why is it – what was the main principle?
B.Z.: The idea was to create such a gospel choir.
Then came the idea of assembling this choir of soloists from home music scenes with a good voice.
So this six-member congregation - Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik<0xC5><0x91> Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - came together, which we then baptized into the Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Is that exactly how you thought of the song, or did the girls transform something into it?
B.Z.: The song had existed in the instrumental version for a long time, when the material on the record came down, we thought that something else would be needed for this song.
The track of the chords made it harder for the singing party to join him.
That night I sang a melody to him, which the girls later learned.
It all happened for the first time and very spontaneously.
I remember how it came back to life, but of course, there was a need for Diva.
With my voice, it wouldn't work that energetic.
hvg.hu: Both on the board and at the concert, it seemed that the girls were in the background.
They don’t have solos (except for Judy Jay), they don’t have their own roles, they sing together, and they’re not louder than music, so the music just doesn’t accompany their singing.
They also stood behind the scenes.
Is that intentional?
B.Z.: The fact that they were standing behind was only due to technical problems.
The fact that we didn’t want to share solo roles is intentional.
Even that song is about forgetting a little about our ego, where it comes from, where it belongs, and letting only those wings, the wings of love rise up.
I wished that this euphoric state, which we felt when the song was born, was felt by others.
hvg.hu: Who was the most involved?
B.Z.: During the composition of the music actually not with one, heavier pieces appeared rather when mixing.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play a concert wing, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where he didn't want to work groove for a long time, then everything nicely slowly found his place like in some compartment.
hvg.hu: Which song from the new album is your favorite?
B.Z.: It’s always changing with the concerts, even by the fact that I’ve already “released” the record.
Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
Treasury broker risked billions from minority
A treacherous fraudster.
This is what the French banking giant Société Générale, the owner of the domestic Commercial Bank, calls its cowardly employee Jerome Kerviel.
He lost almost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5 billion because of it.
Rather, it seems that Kerviel was just a great player who wanted to match up with his colleagues and certainly not incompetent.
Unlike all major banks, he has experienced a crisis in the U.S. mortgage market.
"He's mentally weaker," his superiors, who were sent to him by the police, heard from the mouth.
However, according to a statement made by French media, such as the Le Monde newspaper, it was the man who had a profit of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.6 billion from his trades at the end of last year.
Crisis not only in America
“All I wanted was to make money for my bank,” he said in a statement.
In the summer, he managed to earn half a billion euros in the US crisis.
He felt the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, reports began to emerge that so-called sub-prime mortgages, provided to low-income clients or those who have had problems with repayment in the past, will have problems.
This crisis did not have an impact on the economy as a whole.
He didn’t believe it and put it right.
At the end of the year, his profits rose to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.6 billion.
“Already when I made the first half a billion, I didn’t know how to announce it,” Kerviel admits, adding that he definitely didn’t do anything for himself.
In the whole interrogation, he admits that he falsified the records so as not to be found.
He even managed to get mad at his bosses, even though he began to be interested in his trades on the Eurex Stock Exchange.
Risk was profit
Was he afraid he'd come?
I don't think so.
“I thought the simple fact that I made <0x24>1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them.”
Where did he take so much risk?
He had to work out his position gradually.
He joined Société Générale in 2000 after graduating from the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around <0x24>51,000.
Two years later, he was already an assistant broker and in 2005 he became a separate broker with an annual salary of <0x24>90,000.
Yet he knew he would never make as much as the others.
“Already in my first interview in 2005, I knew they were looking at me.
Because of my education and also because of my professional and personal development," Kerviel told investigators.
But soon after the start came the first big success.
Thanks to the shares, Allianz was earning half a billion euros in the London bombings.
And that was the trigger mechanism - he wanted more.
As long as you earn, we'll leave you
"It's like a snowball," he told the police.
But the bosses said they knew all about it, or rather they did.
"While I was making money, they closed their eyes."
But then came the morning at the beginning of this year.
He lost <0x24>1 billion in a single day.
After the weekend in mid-January, he wanted to cool it down.
When he came to work on Monday, he no longer worked at the bank.
And the bank reported a few days later that it had lost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5 billion due to him.
And how did they get to him?
He became a suspect because of his vacation.
“I’ve only chosen four days for the last year.
A broker who does not have a vacation is a broker who does not want anyone to look at his records,” Kerviel concluded.
Czech Republic has a chance to win 365 billion
The ministers of the Czech government signed a total of nine operational programmes, of which the Czech Republic can receive <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14 billion (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>365 billion) in the coming years.
This is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
Approximately SEK 125 billion will go from seven operational programmes to regions.
Czech companies will be able to receive about 100 billion SEK from the Entrepreneurship and Innovation programme.
The most money, up to 150 billion, will be spent on transportation.
The Transportation Programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the funds.
This money will increase the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will be managed next year with an amount of NOK 90.8 billion.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme is intended to serve entrepreneurs and companies to raise funds for innovative entrepreneurship.
Firms should obtain funding for the introduction of new technologies, for industrial research, but also for the introduction of more effective organizational methods.
So far, the Czech Republic has been among the least successful in drawing money from EU funds in the newly accepted countries.
Twenty-year sentence for former president of Nicaragua confirmed by court
The appeals court in Nicaragua on Thursday confirmed a 20-year sentence for former President Arnold Alemán, who was convicted in 2003 of financial fraud of <0x24>100 million (less than <0x24>1.8 billion).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived in a domestic prison in his hacienda near the Nicaraguan metropolis.
If the former head of this Central American state from 1997 to 2002 returns behind bars, it is not clear at this time, according to the AP.
According to the appellate court’s president, Ileana Pérez, it will now be up to the inmates whether they allow Germany to prolong his sentence at home or go to jail.
Four years ago, the court proved to Germany that he had regularly transferred government money to the accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest supporters.
Some of this money then ended up in a fund that Germany founded to fund its 2001 election campaign.
They gave us the budget.
That's right.
The state budget has been approved.
Why is this budget exceptional?
It is the first budget drawn up by this government and adopted by a coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
Last year, he passed it with the support of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD could not afford to refuse it.
Unlike the tumultuous debate before the vote on distrust of the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
This traditionally overlooked, though most influential, law was quietly passed by the House of Representatives.
It is a certain paradox.
Every government starts and ends with individual chapters and budget items, whether someone likes or dislikes them.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but it is hidden behind the powerful rivalry of the government with the opposition.
He is more grateful to the media, and therefore he pays much more attention to the media.
Politicians’ guessing is much more interesting to the public than strict numbers.
State budgets in past social democratic governments have suffered from three shortcomings that for 2008 it is not able to solve at once:
The first of these is a high share of the law of mandatory expenditures, which are not only pensions, but also social allowances, which were approved by the silent "coalition" of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and the KS<0xC4><0x8C>M last year before the elections.
The second of these is deficit management as a result of the failure of the first.
The third limit is the public finance deficit, i.e. the budget deficit of cities and municipalities.
The biggest risk, however, is not the government budget deficit.
It is public and relatively controlled.
The time bomb, however, is the budget deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors, in addition to tax money, fees, and loans from banks, obtain additional resources for investments, often headlessly issue bonds by which they disproportionately owe their councilors.
In recent years, they have managed to pay off these debts by mass sale of shares of energy and other distribution networks, which they received from the state in privatization.
They no longer have this resource.
If we adhere only to official and verifiable facts, we will find that:
Our economy has been undergoing a growth phase for several years, as well as the rest of the world, and the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD is constantly flourishing.
This was a unique opportunity for her governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, the state was increasingly indebted.
Other countries, except for a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, managed much more reasonably than our republic.
It is a great shame that falls primarily on past governments.
We are among the countries that are the least endangered by poverty on a global scale.
Therefore, there is no need for massive social programs, which, unfortunately, have, in recent years, become completely unnecessarily huge.
Even though some of the nonsense populist spending approved this year before the elections have been cancelled, if there is no shortage of retirement and pension reform, then any policy in this country will actually end, and no matter who will rule.
With little excess, one can say that the ruling politicians become officials, mechanically dividing most of the taxed money into pensions and social allowances.
Therefore, this year’s budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only stop the suppression of normal expenditures by mandatory expenditures.
The planned deficit of <0x24>70 billion for 2008 would be absolutely unnecessary if past governments failed in the last ten years as they could.
If we don’t really want the government to become a mere official, then we have to be patient and give it to this not too strong coalition government, which realizes that the state can only spend as many reforms as it can get, tax cuts and fees.
Only those will enable the gradual achievement of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided together to fight the financial market crisis.
In this way, more than <0x24>100 billion will be reached in the currency markets through auctions.
In these auctions, the banks raise interest rates at which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the US Fed will send <0x24>40 billion to auction, and another <0x24>24 will be made available to the European and Swiss central banks.
This is the first time that the central banks of each country have agreed on such a coordinated procedure to prevent or mitigate the consequences of the financial crisis.
“This step is designed to address the biggest problems of the economy, i.e. the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend,” Bernard Baumohl, of Economic Outlook Group, wrote in his report to clients.
“The coordinated action of central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to 50 percent,” Baumohl said in his report.
Banks have already lost <0x24>60 billion due to unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect billions of more losses.
“Central banks must really be afraid of what might be next when they decide on this process,” said ABN chief economist Amro Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks are concerned that if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will lend it to their customers as well.
This would reduce consumption and send the U.S. economy into a recession with potential impacts on global economic growth.
The central banks thus decided after failing to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate used to lend money in the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still concerned about lending money to each other, despite the fact that the central banks of the United States, Canada and Britain had lowered their interest rates several times during the fall.
“It will have the same effect as another interest rate drop,” Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that the move of central banks will help trigger the crisis because it does not solve the underlying problem, and that is the fall of the US real estate market.
Klaus: Ecological debates are unbelievable
Global climate change is the most detrimental to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again expressed his views on the issue of global warming.
Criticism has now taken place at the end of the UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not Green Planet, he said that ecologists’ debates are incredible.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, consisting of a strange mixture of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that binds it to reality.
“The debate there is completely unstructured, it’s just a fireworks word that is a substitute for solving the current problems,” Klaus said.
In presenting his book, the Czech President stressed that its topic is very important to him, and that is why he is so committed to them.
He also expressed satisfaction that the book also appears in a German translation, because, as he said, "I often only encounter the cartoons of my opinions".
Now, therefore, the readers can read his unshakable attitudes.
Klaus recalled that although he is not a climatologist, in his opinion he has enough assumptions to write such a book.
He is an academic, capable of monitoring and assessing professional negotiations, has experience with statistics and is also a national economist.
The main conclusions of the book are the thesis that the climate is constantly changing and its changes are therefore normal, that there is not a common view of all scientists on warming the planet, that the consequences of the current changes are not too big and serious and therefore do not represent threats, threats and threats.
Moreover, as a person with experience with totalitarianism, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels as a dangerous restriction to freedom.
He reiterated that he is not against “reasonable environmental protection, but against militant environmentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and their benefits.”
Klaus spoke on the same subject in Vienna two months ago at Hayek Institute.
600,000 people could not change their driver's license.
Six hundred thousand drivers have passed the deadline and failed to exchange an old driver's license, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day that people can ask for an exchange so that the authorities can still issue them a new passport by the end of the year.
But the ministry is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers will be on the road after the New Year without a valid license.
According to the authorities, the passports were not exchanged mainly by those who no longer want to drive.
While the municipality reports a sharp decline in interest in changing the driver's license, the authorities in the metropolis are overwhelmed by requests and interest in changing the license has increased this week.
The Master’s degree holds about 2,000 clients a day.
It's been around for about half an hour on the front.
Approximately 140,000 drivers have not yet exchanged their driver’s license in Prague.
The issuance of a new passport takes 20 days.
However, it is possible to request a release within a shortened period of five days.
In this case, the driver will pay <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Motorists who do not have to change their passports by the end of the year and go on the road without a valid driver will be subject to a fine from January.
The contractor shall pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
But the policeman can also deal with the offence by agreement.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine shall be increased to 2500 kroner.
According to previous information, he could have received a fine from the town hall and the man who was not going anywhere.
He was supposed to pay <0x24>30,000.
The ministry earlier called on the authorities to be gentle and impose a maximum fine of a thousand crowns.
According to transport ministry spokesman Karl Hanzelka, there is no risk of a 10,000-month fine.
The driver's license is a document that people can decide if they want it or not.
This is not a passport that every person must have.
People who no longer want to drive should give up their driving licence.
All you need to do is take it away or send it to the competent municipal office by post.
At the end of the year, certificates issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid.
However, drivers need to gradually change other types of driver’s licenses.
People with documents from 1994 to 2000 have another three years to exchange.
The validity of the certificates issued between 2001 and 2004 shall expire in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million more documents.
Court Reduces Penalties for Detectives Associated with Berdych
Former policemen Josef Opava and Petr Ko<0xC5><0x9B>a<0xC5><0x99>ík, who are charged with a criminal association with the gang of David Berdych, are sentenced to thirteen and ten years in prison.
With definitive validity, the Prague Supreme Court ruled on this, which reduced their sentences by one year and the other by two years.
Initially, the detectives of the Prague Committee on Combating Organized Crime were threatened for 14 and 12 years.
It is no longer possible to appeal against today’s decision, it is only possible to appeal to the Supreme Court.
Although Berdych is also accused in this case, he is only awaiting a verdict in the first instance.
In other trials, however, he has already received sentences of more than 16 years.
He can't get more.
In January, the regional court found 19 people guilty of participating in the robbery, and the Supreme Court ruled today that 16 of them had been appealed.
Most of the defendants have rejected the indictment since the start of the investigation, saying it was a constructed case.
According to the Central Senate, police officers, in agreement with Berdych, among other things, passed information from police sources, hiding individual thefts, and helping gang members avoid criminal responsibility.
The gang paid 30 percent off the loop for Opava and the Horseman.
The indictment is about the crime of the gang from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, thefts, whose victims have often suffered serious harm to their health, but also the abuse of public authority and illegal armaments.
During home inspections, the police discovered illegally held guns, steel core shotguns, laser targets or guns.
The gang allegedly stole tens of millions of crowns.
In addition to the nearly twenty men in this trial, the courts have already found guilty of other robberies of Berdych and a number of other people.
Other men from the Berdych area are already testifying before the court in another trial, some cases have not yet been brought before the court.
Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Pótvi and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulejovi, who remain in Irish custody, have been avoided so far, awaiting a final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
Children's turnover account: <0x24>12 million
The lawyer of the injured families, Igor Veleb, wants to compensate 12 million crowns for the conspiracy of children in the maternity ward after the hospital in Trebí<0xC4><0x8D>a.
For each mother for <0x24>3 million, for the father for <0x24>2 million, and for the children for <0x24>1 million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dostal, the legal representative of the hospital, therefore, fundamentally disagrees with the proposal of Veleby.
"We reject such a request, it is very high," he said after today's hearing.
“But in order for us to make an opinion on the counterproposal, we need an expert assessment that the counterpart has made.
Let's see if it has any meaningful value.
But we keep in mind that it will be in the hundreds of thousands for all,” Dostál stressed.
According to him, the share should range from CZK 100,000 to CZK 200,000 for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the Jablonov family wanted a million crowns for every month that she did not raise her biological daughter.
Velebovi served as the basis for negotiations on the compensation assessment, which was prepared for him by the Faculty Hospital in Prague-Motole.
Parents of children, according to experts in the field of psychology and psychiatry, suffered mental harm and stress at various degrees and depths.
The stressful situation was better tolerated by men, even though they faced clearances that the conspiracy of newborns did not prevent.
Women, on the other hand, are more confronted with the actuality of the trauma experienced and with what is happening right now, summarized the content of Veleb.
Veronica and Nikola exchanged nurses at the birthplace in Trebí<0xC4><0x8D>e on December 9.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to Chermakov in Przybyslavic and Veronika to Libor Brozov and Jaroslav Trojan in Jablonov.
Hejtman of Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Vystr<0xC4><0x8D>íl handed over each of the families 100,000 crowns in late October to compensate for the expenses incurred by the mistake of the hospital established by the county.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured for liability for damages.
In case of error, they must reach the reserve fund, exceptionally they can request the help of the founder.
The courts have so far conceded relatively low compensation to people, the amounts were calculated according to the tables in the rows of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions of crowns.
Polivka lost to the Kingdom of Wallace
Bolek Polívka has lost a dispute over the brand of the Kingdom of Wallace.
According to the judge of the Ostrava County Court, for the first time the designation was used by the King of Wales, but the project was built by a long-term work team around Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, who collaborated with the actor.
The meeting did not take part in today's talks.
According to his lawyer, however, the case probably does not end and the client will appeal.
“The issue is that Mr. Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team are parasitizing the popularity of Bolka Polívka,” Polívka’s lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, everyone will be equipped with the words of the Kingdom of Wallace as well as actors and comedians.
Harabish has the same opinion.
“We have almost a decade of work behind us.
Spending money and inventing actions,” he said.
According to him, they are the cause of money disputes.
“Over the years, they realized that the project was successful and could benefit from it.
They want to parasitize our work,” he added.
Lucrative business
According to the designation court, the king of Wales used Polívka for the first time in his television show.
In 1993, it was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohaty.
At that time, however, it was not related to the intention of building a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> lost the idea of issuing Wales passports.
From the original recession, trade and lucrative business activities were excluded, to which Harabish then founded the company of the Kingdom of Wallachia.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to the name and signature in the passports and even offered their owners a discount on visiting his farm and theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also said today that Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> only used the nude idea that Polívka published in the manuscript for his business intent.
“The popularity of Boleslav’s Kiss of the Wallachian Kingdom project certainly helped,” the judge said.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was Harabish and his team, who was intensively dedicated to it.
The cooperation of the defamated parties continued until 2000, when Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> organized an official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, disputes have begun to accumulate between Polivka and Harabish, culminating in the siege of "King Boleslav I elected to the furt".
The leading role in the kingdom was then played by the singer Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>ulaková as the queen mother.
In 2002, Polivka filed a lawsuit against Harabish and his company, which the court rejected today.
Clearly, it could bring Harabish to the dispute about the throne and half of the princess.
A new king should come out of it.
The details and the date have not yet been disclosed.
"We don't want to rush anything.
It should be like a king's ride to Slovakia.
The king should be elected for a certain period of time.
Even Mr. Polivka can safely sign up,” added Harabish.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Disappearing Prejudices
To be honest, I've never really liked the Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not much, the quality of rank, steering and also production could be labeled leaky as under-average.
But now there is a Peugeot 207 successor on the market, and this one is much better.
And a van called the SW goes a little further and I have nothing left to think about.
When I tested the classic hatchback Peugeot 207, for example, I complained about the space on my head in the rear seats.
This is the end of the complaint here, because the body of the van means that they will not suffer even a two-meter long in this direction.
Flying around the world
I'm going to go through the interior very quickly so I don't repeat myself too much.
It’s a totally overriding design, where I have only one lift to the poor middle tunnel.
Here I would appreciate a little more design invention when the car already looks so stylish.
The seats are comfortable and there are times when we could complain about short seats or supports.
The lateral steering also improved significantly against the 206.
As far as space is concerned, there is an increase in the size of the body.
There is a shortage of space above the head in the van.
Kufry for Kufry
The main thing about this car is its luggage compartment.
I have to evaluate it as very well accessible (and also thanks to the folding rear window) and as decently synchronized.
Noisy seats are equipped with restraint tyres, which are the ideal compromise.
They do not obstruct, they can spread, and at the same time they keep heavy objects.
But let's stop together over the volume.
This is, according to the tables in the basic arrangement, 428 l, which is the average value against the competition.
But not against the best-selling car of this class in the Czech Republic - the <0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the new model, we will find that Peugeot has a very significant 52-litre stagnation.
For a holiday abroad or when loading a cart, this value is critical.
But if I have to raise a positive, I still have to mention a completely straight floor after folding the second row brackets or a very low threshold.
120 horses in four rows
Our tested car was equipped with a 1.6-l diesel four-wheel drive unit with a power of 88 kW.
And to be honest, that's what a sixteen-year-old who drives a family hatchback should look like.
It is quiet, has a small consumption and, above all, stretches.
If I compare it to the pest period, which leaky acts as if it had a bulging cloth in the exhaust, then I can only be excited about it.
The price list will show
The price of the car is not popular.
However, we must remember that we have tested a decently equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a car with a 14-cylinder for 329 900 CZK will go.
Our aggregate costs from 410 900 CZK, which is quite enough.
The tested Premium equipment will then arrive for an additional 80,000 CZK above.
But we still had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic start of wipers, electric rear window control...
Simply the car costs everything 531 900 CZK.
It's a lot, but count your extra equipment with Fabie and you'll get a very similar number.
There is nothing left to do but choose the brand.
The integration of Slovak pupils in British schools fails
In the UK schools, children from Eastern European countries are increasing, causing concern among local settlers about further development of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has so far faced a number of obstacles.
British schools even record cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of the indigenous population increase in violence.
The problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe in British schools is well illustrated by the case in northern Kent, where disputes between local settlers and Slovak immigrants are beginning to escalate.
Controversies, scams and quarrels between students have also shifted to relationships between parents.
The situation went so far that Slovak police arrested a Slovak woman in Chatham who had beaten a 10-year-old student with an iron rod.
Provinila is prevented from insulting her by racist extortion.
Police had to intervene even after two teenage girls attacked a Slovak immigrant.
Men's girls allegedly honored with racist remarks and threw stones at him.
“When we went home, a boy jumped up to the bus stop and started swimming at us.
When I told him to stop it, he fired on us apples and peppers, and then he revealed his ass," the mother of Slovak students described another unpleasant event for The Times.
Complaints are on both sides.
One of the local settlers even signaled disputes with immigrants from Eastern Europe for the fight for survival.
The above-mentioned cases show that the atmosphere in British schools between locals and immigrants is starting to get tense.
In the UK, 70,000 Slovaks are registered for work here.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students then attend British schools.
Cuba's most beautiful island in the Caribbean
It is truly an island of freedom for visitors.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, it can be done for you if you choose the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves, or sea, calm like a pond.
Palmy and all-inclusive with waiters, offering on the beach pizza, ice cream and drunk cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands in the Caribbean you will find it in a full and richer reading.
On only one island you will find much more and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
After the Spaniards, Cuba was the garden of their conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye ever saw.
Havana became a warehouse and a translator of treasures that the Spanish invaded and transported to Europe.
And then came the American era.
Hotel Nacional grew up in the late 20s.
He was built by one of the chiefs of the U.S. mafia Lucky Luciano, because everything that was a crime in the U.S. (especially for prohibitions) was welcomed in Cuba and promoted by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were Ms.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise houses grew, along wide boulevards, cars that belonged to the cult symbols of the 1950s.
Ernest Hemingway bought a settlement in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and had his yacht in Cojimar.
On the walls of Bodeguity del Medio, the stars of the showbusiness and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
What about today?
You can also leave your autograph on the walls of the Havana Bodeguita.
A cocktail is served in the bar at the Hotel Nacional at your request.
And those cult cars from the 1950s have been driving around Havana so far, because imported candlesticks and chips in that salty and wet weather had long since been smashed.
Although Havana, especially its oldest part, is considerably shrouded, there are not as many beautiful colonial monuments in the area as there are.
Other places are also transformed into beauty, such as Trinidad.
Since tourism brings so much needed money, its development has a green one.
Over the past fifteen years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another landmark that is unique in the world and is especially appreciated by trainers.
A handful of the extensive plantations were loaded into sugar mills on narrow tracks by steam and motor trains.
Their fleet hasn’t been restored for many decades, so there are working machines, the layers of which are already in museums.
Where to go?
Cuba’s most famous destinations are not missed.
And so about Varader, or Havana, there's not much to write about.
It should be remembered that in the already mentioned Hemingway settlement there is a museum and who likes this writer, should not miss a visit.
One of the most picturesque corners of Cuba is the Viníales Valley in the west of the island.
The lush vegetation grows from the limestone floor.
Mogots, limehomals and rocks rise steeply from the bottom of the valley and fertile soil is trapped in their cavities, thanks to which the vented rocks are also covered with dense growth.
The valley is the place where perhaps the best quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
You can meet with his final image if you visit one of Havana’s tobacco-making factories.
It may also be interesting to see that the Chilean work of Major Zeman was being done there.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded not long after the Spanish colonized the island.
Glory and wealth brought him the slave trade and sugar.
Wealth has been transformed into the beauty and exhibition of a small city.
Colonial Spanish architecture, significantly influenced by later French settlers, has barely changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is a place so remote that in the 1950s there was no road connecting that region with the rest of the country.
The insulation helped him stay away.
Nothing was built there, and therefore nothing was broken, everyone was glad that he had a roof over his head.
If a person has more than one afternoon in Trinidad, then it is worth looking at some interesting places in the vicinity, such as Playa Ancón Beach or the Sucre Valley.
In the evening, you should go to the Casa de la Música, which revives after midnight and the music in it is quiet over the morning.
Baracoa
A town in the very east of Cuba is considered by some to be the most beautiful on the island.
Such an opinion is already influencing the path itself.
The two roads that lead there from Guantánamo must overcome the high and steep mountains and pass through nature that human activity has barely recognized.
The eastern island of Cuba has been listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, thanks to its uninterrupted nature.
They make the best chocolate there, in the church they have the Columbus Cross (in fact formed about a hundred years after Columbus's cruise) and from the hill where the former castle and today's El Castillo hotel stand, you can see several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, about the Sierra Maestra Mountains, about the pig hut and the island of Isla de Pinos, about the Tropicana cabaret, about the sanctuary of the Cuban patron Caridad del Cobre, about the sanctity, of the African religions that profess the descendants of some many slaves.
But, as they say, it’s better to see it once.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans say
Few troops and the lack of necessary equipment, according to the United States, affect the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Defense Minister Robert Gates, NATO is planning a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not supposed to take place, representatives of the countries that have units in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to growing opposition from the Taliban, eight participating countries are also discussing other plans and the coordination of the Allies.
While the United States this week, through Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, called on NATO troops to step up, the United Kingdom sees priority in strengthening the Afghan government’s authority and strengthening development aid.
“The development in Afghanistan is tangible, but military power can only be one part of the solution.
The next step is to enable the people to start further development of the economy and security themselves," British Defense Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
Twenty percent
Afghan insurgents’ activity is the highest in the last five years, according to the U.S. military.
The number of violent acts increased by 27 percent compared to last year, in the southern Helmand province by 60 percent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, of which about a quarter is in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the Allies reached the same limit in the organization and equipment of the units.
Specifically, they are requesting additional helicopters, soldiers and experts for training Afghan units.
“We’re going to have to seriously think about the specific goals for the next year and the ways to achieve them,” Gates said.
In a similar sense today, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop spoke.
“I’m not happy with what we have in Afghanistan on the ground and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that’s little,” De Hoop told Reuters at the end of three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
In recent months, there has also been debate among the participating countries as to whether all the allies are doing the maximum in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticized for its passiveness.
“Germans have a relatively large number of representations in Afghanistan.
But they are deployed in areas where there is a minimum of violence and the fighting demands for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern parts of the country," Gates said.
The British bulletin newspaper Sun this week labeled German soldiers as leopards.
"Afghan fighters revealed: The Germans are playing while our boys are fighting," Sun wrote in a material supplemented by pictures of German soldiers playing table tennis.
German Bild went into counterattack and printed a picture of the British unit during a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
State debt to rise to a trillion in 2009
For every Czech, the state debt is more than 84,000 kroner.
Total debt rose to SEK 842.7 billion at the end of September.
The government planned to lend 159.2 billion crowns this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns thanks to better government budget management.
At the end of September, the Czech Republic’s public debt rose to SEK 842.7 billion.
In nine months of this year, it increased by 40.2 billion kroner.
Since June, however, it has fallen by 13.4 billion kroner.
The Ministry of Finance has confirmed its state debt data since the beginning of October.
Each Czech is indebted to more than 84,000 crowns.
Over the past year, the state has owed more than 111 billion crowns.
"So far, it seems that due to the lower deficit for next year, we could exceed the trillion-dollar limit until 2009.
Next year, the debt should range between 900 billion and a trillion kroner," Patria Finance analyst David Marek told iHNed.cz.
Similarly, Next Finance analyst Vladimír Pikora says: “We could get to exceeding one trillion in 2009.
When exactly will it depend on the next budget, which we do not yet know.
If it turns out that the situation on the political scene would change, politicians would be willing to save more, it could move to 2010.
But I don't expect this change," he said.
Indebtedness
State debt forms the debt of the central government and is primarily caused by the accumulation of deficits in the state budget.
The government debt is financed by cash receipts, government bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state’s domestic debt has so far increased by 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion kronor.
The state’s foreign debt has so far increased by 1.7 billion kroner to 123.3 billion kroner.
The so-called commercial public debt at the end of September reached CZK 803.3 billion and declined by CZK 13.7 billion since June.
The average debt maturity of the state increased to 6.5 years.
“The total debt in the first to third quarter of the year increased by 13 percent, which is really a lot about how the economy is doing well.
Interestingly, the increase is generated mainly for bonds, where the increase is 20 percent.
It’s bad that the debt is growing, but on the other hand, it shows that it will trade what it will do when there’s a retirement reform,” Pikor said.
Better than expected
The 2007 strategy for the financing and management of public debt shows that the government planned to lend 159.2 billion SEK this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns thanks to better government budget management.
The share is mainly the state budget deficit, which is expected to reach 76 billion crowns this year instead of an estimated 91.3 billion crowns.
Furthermore, these are the planned maximum resources for the Czech Consolidation Agency of SEK 13.3 billion, the 10-billion-dollar reserve for the payment of pensions, the financing of state debts of SEK 43 billion and the repayment of loans from the European Investment Bank of SEK 1.8 billion.
A woman is to go to court today in Charter for giving a name to a teddy bear
A British teacher convicted in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced to 15 days in prison by a Chartered Court on Thursday evening and expelled, her lawyer said.
Britain has been accused of letting six- to seven-year-old students give the bear the name of Mohammed despite the fact that any depiction of a prophet of Islam is forbidden.
She was subject to a penalty of injury.
The 40-year-old British teacher, working at Unity High School in the Sudanese Charter, was arrested at her home on Sunday and charged with insulting Islam and rebellion, in accordance with article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, according to the Ministry of Education.
Our story actually begins in September, when the teacher in question asks her six to seven-year-old pupils to choose a name for a class teddy bear.
“Eight names will be heard from the mouths of children, including Hasan, Abdullah and Mohamed,” says Robert Boulos, the school’s director.
After the vote in the class, 20 of the 23 children will eventually choose Mohamed as the most popular name.
Of course, Muhammad is the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all, it is a very common name in Sudan.
The children then created a book for their class with a picture of a bear accompanied by a description: "My name is Mohammed".
The bear himself had no label with this name, but the problem is in the very depiction of a prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One of her Muslim colleagues, Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, said she knew her well and would never do anything that could be offensive to any religious belief: “I just regret that she asked her children to vote for them.”
This opinion is shared by many teachers who describe it as "very attentive to their students" and add that "they never talk about religion in class".
Remember that the surname Mohammed is also the second most commonly given surname in the United Kingdom, in English it is written in fourteen different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families represents a way to honor the Prophet (often given to the firstborn).
What, though, are the rules regarding the use of this name?
Is it possible to give a toy?
Sure, it's a question of interpretation.
During the last round of negotiations this Wednesday in Vienna, they failed to reach an agreement on the future status of the province.
In the end, failure.
The Serbian and Kosovo Albanians ended the sixth and final round of talks in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning, without being able to overcome the different views on the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that both sides were not able to reach a status agreement," European negotiator Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
His U.S. counterpart, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the region is “at stake” and called on Belgrade and Pristina to take up their commitments to peace and be ready for dialogue even after the negotiations have ended.
“We don’t expect violence in the near future, but we’re entering a challenging period,” he said, adding that “it’s obvious that the situation is tense.”
Negotiations end on 10 December
Negotiators of the Troika, consisting of representatives of the European Union, the United States and Russia, will travel to Kosovo for the last time on Monday.
The future of the province, where 90 percent of the Albanian-speaking population, could be seen in a brighter light on December 10, when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian negotiator Alexander Bocan-Charchenko are due to submit their report to the UN Security Council.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, are the sixth and at the same time the last round of negotiations since the UN commissioned the Troika in August this year.
Americans and Europeans expect the talks to end on December 10th.
On the other hand, Russians, who have previously blocked Kosovo’s independence in the UN Security Council, insist that the negotiations continue even after this deadline.
“Russia has been and remains inclined to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution,” Bocan-Charchenko said.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of governing the international community, the West considers Kosovo’s independence under EU supervision as the only stepping stone.
Pristina declares that if the Security Council does not decide in its favour, it is ready to declare independence unilaterally.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, we have not reached an agreement," Kosovo self-government president Fatmir Sejdiu said in a hotel in Baden, where the "last chance" was held since Monday.
Hashim Thaçi, the former rebel leader of the Kosovo Albanians and future prime minister of the province, expressed regret.
He added, however, that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade “belongs to the past that led to murders and deportations.”
"Domain effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadic, on the other hand, believes that the compromise is still being considered and warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo against the consequences of possible unilaterally declared independence of the province.
Belgrade is particularly concerned about the "domestic effect" in the region, which is still unstable as a result of the independence wars in the 1990s.
"But for Serbia it does not mean that a compromise is impossible," he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that all decisions should be the exclusive responsibility of the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has the right to veto.
"Kosovo's parliament will have the last word"
"For Serbia, only a solution taken from the Security Council is acceptable," said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Ko<0xC5><0xA1>tunica.
“This negotiation lasted two years.
It must end as it began: on the ground of the Security Council."
Fatmir Sedjiu told reporters that “the last word on the status will be the Kosovo parliament” and added that if there was a unilateral declaration of independence by Albanian-speaking citizens, it would take place “after an agreement” with the West.
Bush has reached an agreement on Israelis and Palestinians
At the start of an international peace conference in Annapolis, Maryland, summoned from his standpoint, U.S. President George Bush announced that the Israelis and Palestinians finally agreed on a joint statement.
He said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas agreed on the immediate start of talks with the intention of resolving a 60-year dispute between the two nations once and for all.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised to do everything in his power to help them conclude a “peace agreement” before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must destroy “terrorist infrastructure” and Israel must end colonial activities, Bush said, recalling the obligations for both sides from the “travel map” to the peace they adopted in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority led by Abbas are aimed at “closing a peace treaty that would resolve all unresolved issues without exception, including the central issues.”
This statement includes three issues at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of the Arab refugees expelled from their homes in the territory of today’s State of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Abbas took the words after the U.S. president and stressed that the subsequent negotiations should be "full and thorough" and touch on all aspects of the solution, with mentioning "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among others".
Olmert then went to the tribune, stating that the subsequent negotiations should be "direct and continuous" and that "it should be set to be closed during 2008".
Bush set the end of 2008 as a deadline to realize his "two-state vision" of the Palestinian and Israeli, existing alongside one another.
Saudi Arabia said it had accepted a commitment from Bush in this regard even before deciding to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, has initiated a proposal adopted by all Arab countries, which offers peace to Israel in exchange for leaving all Arab territories seized by the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
“Annapolis is a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it fights against the roots of the conflict and its central aspects,” the Saudi prince said in an interview he gave to an Arab-speaking newspaper with Saudi capital.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is always the case with such small reports from the black chronicle, official versions do not agree with what is being said among people.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation by the Inspection générale de la police nationale (IGPN), the police car passed on Sunday shortly after the 17th hour of Louise-Michel Street in the village of Villiers-le-Bel.
“The vehicle was not in the mode of intervention, but was on guard and ran at speeds of 40 to 50 km/h, without the side lights on,” a police source said.
Kawasaki's green motorcycle, "unregistered, and therefore without permission to ride on public transport" (read below), driven by two young people without helmets, passed "very high speed".
"The motorcycle hit the left in the police car after it didn't give preference to the right," a police officer said.
A blood alcohol test performed on the vehicle’s crew proved to be negative.
The condition of the car (sprayed front, broken windshield, stiffened bumpers) indicates the sharpness of the impact.
The prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, reacted very quickly and yesterday morning announced that the IGPN had commissioned an investigation into "acts of involuntary killing and non-providing assistance to persons under threat" (Oparticipation of the Police), whose direction is threatened by the Val-de-Valence region.
On the occasion of an afternoon press conference, the prosecutor said that the investigation conducted by the IGPN excludes, at this stage, the responsibility of the police officers for the accident.
The three witnesses, who were interrogated on Sunday night, said the official had confirmed "the police version, namely that the minimotower was approaching them fairly quickly to the left."
A crack, undoubtedly caused by the cracking of the clips on the ground, showed yesterday that both vehicles remained enchanted until the police car was able to stop.
The vehicles were secured and passed through technical expertise.
Yesterday, the bodies of both victims were suffocated.
What happened right after that?
Yesterday in Villiers-le-Bel, there were rumors that police should leave the scene quickly without giving first aid to two young men.
The IGPN was to, with all due caution, also exclude "any serious guilt" at this point.
“This is a more demanding aspect of the investigation, which requires more search and with which we need to be very cautious,” a police source said.
The journal "Liberation" met with an obvious witness for a few moments following the accident.
One of his windows leads directly to where the accident took place.
“I immediately, along with the nurse who is a nurse in the hospital, came downstairs to try to resurrect them,” said the witness.
I couldn't do anything."
Then he saw “a smiling, totally frightened policeman.
Two others tried to raise one of the boys and the fourth spoke on the phone."
Faced with the rapidly rising tensions and the certainty of the young people present that the situation is hopeless, policemen were taken by car by colleagues, who in the meantime arrived.
According to the same witness, the rescue arrived "about twenty minutes after the police left".
They also performed a heart massage, but in vain.
“Let no one say that the police authorities did not help the young people.
First aid was provided to these young people.
The firefighters arrived immediately.
“Everything has been done to save them,” the prosecutor said.
Tensions in Pakistan are growing
Pakistani police on Monday suppressed the first demonstration since General Musharraf declared a state of emergency two days earlier.
In Lahore, in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers demonstrating against measures taken under the state of emergency were wounded by tear gas grenades, which, according to witnesses, were used by law enforcement.
The last nominees responded by stone, injuring several police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been summoned.
Similar scenarios as in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police attacked and wounded lawyers.
A few were to be summoned.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court lawyers called for a general strike and announced demonstrations as a result of the wave of about 500 arrests of opponents, human rights fighters and lawyers over the weekend.
The access roads to the Supreme Court were blocked on Monday morning, with the aim of preventing gatherings.
Further demonstrations were to take place in Multan (centre) and in Peshawar (northwest).
On Monday, the lawyers’ movement gained support from religious parties grouped in the politically strong Muttahida alliance Majlis-e-Amal, whose president “invited the population to send flowers to judges who fought against the state of emergency, and the wastes to those who preceded the Mujahideen.
"Musharraf's promise does not apply"
The Pakistani Supreme Court is the direct target of the emergency measure announced on Saturday evening.
In the coming days, Musharraf’s re-election in the indirect presidential election, which took place on 6 October, was to be declared legal.
Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry has been removed and replaced.
“Everything we are witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional and against the Supreme Court’s verdicts,” the official told The News.
Parvis Musharraf's promise to resign from commanding the army and become a civilian president "does not apply" after the emergence of the state of emergency, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to resign his military uniforms by November 15, when he ended his first presidential term.
The Deputy Information Minister also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
The Pakistani government has also reversed ongoing speculation in the country that the military chief had ordered President Musharraf to be imprisoned.
More than a third of pregnancy still constitutes an unexpected pregnancy
This estimate includes unwanted pregnancy (24%) as well as poorly planned or unexpectedly occurring.
More than one in three (36%) pregnancies is still unexpected today, according to a study conducted by the French Institut national d'études démographiques (Ined)- the State Institute of Demographic Studies, forty years after the adoption of the Neuwirt Act, which in France is illegal.
This estimate includes unwanted pregnancy (24%) as well as poorly planned or unexpectedly occurring.
Various methods of contraception, such as hormonal contraception or sterilization, still show a 5% to 6% failure rate, according to Ined.
After all, the legalization of contraception only allowed better "fertility control," the institute claims, noting that the rate of hormonal contraception in women between 20 and 44 years of age rose from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Eight out of every 10 births are now well planned.
One in five couples even have births calculated exactly for the month and, if possible, in the spring, which is considered the most pleasant season for the birth of a child.
Remarkable Repair of the Space Station
More than seven hours of work in space was needed by astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crew from the International Space Station (ISS) for the remarkable repair of the scattered solar panel necessary for the station’s further scientific activity.
It was a risky exit into space that accumulated records in terms of duration, distances from residential modules, the speed at which it was planned, and the degree of "caulence" that astronauts had spent repairing.
The problems arose on Tuesday, as astronauts from the Discovery ship unveiled the Harmony module, a large cylindrical unit designed to install the European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is kind of a landing mole for laboratory modules.
You need to be able to supply electricity.
The second task of the crew, therefore, was to relocate the seventeen-and-a-half-ton module generating electricity using solar panels that were already on the ISS, so that it could hit its final position.
After relocating it, the crew began to deploy seventy-metre solar panels of the module.
And in that one of the panels, decomposing as a pulling harmonica,due to the shrinking of the cable, was damaged on the surface of no less than a meter.
Decomposition was suspended to prevent further damage to the panel.
Astronauts, who were originally supposed to make a check-out on the Discovery ship, and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system had malfunctioned, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to fly to the end of the robotic shoulder of the ship, added to the shoulder of the station, and made a repair.
It is one of the best spacewalkers by the U.S. Aviation and Space Agency (NASA).
He is tall, tall, very turnable, has a very elaborate chest and long arms.
At the age of 46, this original profession was commissioned by the doctor to "operate" the "spinned" solar panel.
After investigating the damage in detail, he cut off the faulty cable and fastened some "fats" to the damaged places.
He was assisted by a second "spacewalker" who stayed near the clearing chamber, as well as inside, by other astronauts, including Peggy Witson, the crew commander.
The tools he used, namely a mini-hockey glued with an insulating means to prevent electroshock on solar panels producing several hundred volts, were invented and produced "after the kitty" by astronauts on board the station.
After the operation, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed and then inventoried his tools and returned to the inner part of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts had a half-day rest before today, when seven astronauts return to the Discovery ship to return to Earth on Wednesday as planned.
EADS shares weaken
EADS shares will lose substantially on the Paris Stock Exchange after the company, which operates in the aviation and defense industry, announced that it will have to spend <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.2 to 1.4 billion to cope with the delay of the A400M.
EADS lost 4% and is now on the Paris Stock Exchange at <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>21.96.
The financial group was forced to re-evaluate its expected production results for 2007 as a result of delays resulting from the slow progress of the development of the A400M engine, which is a prerequisite for the launch flight.
The price for alleviating delays in the delivery of the military cargo aircraft, announced in October, was estimated at "1.2 to 1.4 billion euros, of which more than <0x24>1 billion for Airbus," the European designer's parent company EADS said.
Due to these costs, EADS will be forced to announce a new perspective of profit before deducting interest and taxes (EBIT) next Thursday when it presents its quarterly results.
The Group also revealed that the new cost estimate corresponds to a six-month delay.
It should be recalled that EADS’ production results in 2006 decreased by 86 %, mainly due to the costs associated with the delays of another programme, namely the giant A380.
Initially, the group expected the first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
Decisions for status quo
Sunday’s elections will take place without tense expectations: Russians will vote for President Putin’s party, United Russia.
Confirming thus, after the end of very few free election campaigns, their aspirations to stability, and to authoritarianism.
Today, three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin will communicate a broadcast television message to voters on public rights stations, but the content of which is kept secret.
He makes it the leader of the United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party, which is supposed to celebrate a crushing victory.
When yesterday he received the ambassador of foreign countries, the president did not let anything out of him and he was happy with another attack on the West accused of interference - his favorite topic during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy and we wish honest, as transparent and open as possible, elections without the slightest defect in beauty," he said.
In the eyes of the opposition, this is not the case.
They condemn the campaign marked by different pressures.
Communist leader Gennady Zjuganov says that "there has never been such a dirty election, not even for Yeltsin."
Following repressions following last weekend’s demonstrations, former Chess World Champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for an illegal demonstration, continues to be banned.
"Russian mentality is homo sovietica"
Against the backdrop of these simple, tense parliamentary elections, two far more open questions are profiled:
"Who will be Putin's successor in the presidential office?
The official paper yesterday published the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; candidates can be presented to the public by December 23.
Vladimir Putin, who was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, cannot seek a third consecutive term.
There is no follower, however.
"What role will Putin play after March?"
Will I be prime minister?
Or the head of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful party of the United Russia, which elects the government and the president?
Either way, the exiting ruling power will win the whole line in the parliamentary, as well as in the presidential elections.
It's a tradition.
"Russians are left with the mentality of homo soviética, they don't feel like they are the lords of their destiny," says sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent center Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of St. Petersburg notes more time-distant connections: civil society collected, in this country rechristianized five centuries after Europe, delays; that famous common spirit delayed the formation of the individual.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, “Putin adhered to the paternalistic model of the state, perfectly accepted by the population, rather that this new paternalism did not bring about terror but a certain economic well-being,” said Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians “voluntaryly give up the personal responsibilities” that they demonstrated shortly after the collapse of the USSR.
"What to think?"
This phenomenon applies to all social layers, including the business world.
Even the official elite intends to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (out of a total of 85 heads of Russian regions) are run by local candidates of the United Russia.
New freedoms taken from the West are often, as in the 1990s, synonymous with chaos.
The public prefers stability.
Also, in the name of stability, the Russians will not vote for extremists.
Conclusion of Tamara Cherednicenko, forty-year-old professor: "What to think?
Those who are in power are not so bad, so why change them?”
Loaded Memory
After more than 60 years in a confidential regime, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which account for the fate of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are opening to the public.
47 million archives of 27 km long stored in Bad Arolsen (Hesse) were only available for "humanitarian" purposes, i.e. individually, at the request of the former victim or her authorized persons.
Eleven states responsible for managing archives – including Germany, France, Israel and the United States – agreed in May to open them to scientists and historians.
Since the process of ratification of this agreement by all States is at an end, the opening yesterday took effect.
Sensitive information
The free access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow them to explore "especially the displacement of prisoners, the population of camps and the health status of forced workers", explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives led by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CR-CI, Comité international de la Croix).
Until recently, a number of states, including Germany, were opposed to making these nominative documents available to the public due to the sensitive nature of some information.
What is supposed to be homosexuality or the mental impairment of some of the victims of deportation?
After the war, the registers of concentration camps or detainees compiled by the Gestapo were collected for the practical purpose of finding deported or forced work subject to civilians, bringing them proof of their incarceration in order to open the way for their compensation.
Today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen deal with tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is only a limited benefit.
"Nothing fundamentally new can be expected from these documents," said Prof. Wolfgang Benz, director of the Centre for the Study of Anti-Semitism at the Technische Universität Berlin in 2006.
The EU and India want to achieve free trade agreements in 2008
Currently, bilateral trade between Europe and India reaches at least <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion a year.
The EU is India’s first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India are expecting the signing of a free trade agreement in 2008, said European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath.
In April last year, the EU foreign ministers gave green to the European Commission to start negotiations with a view to signing free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian States (ASEAN) (ASEAN) 60 countries.
The EU is India’s first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is, according to the European Commission, the EU’s ninth trading partner.
“Free trade agreements will overwhelm both economies tremendously” and “India will gain better access to the market of 450 million thriving Europeans,” Mandelson said.
Europe represents the first or second market of the Manoro<0xC5><0x9B><0xC4><0x87>a market for each of the first ten products exported by India, the European Commissioner said in a statement. The Asian and European giants together exchange "47 billion euros in goods" and "one hundred billion euros in services".The EU's "manoro<0xC5><0x9B><0xC4><0x9B><0xC4><0x87>a", the European Commissioner said this week, in a statement by Danièle Smadja.

Bank of England Recognizes Concern and Offers <0xC2><0xA3>10 Billion in Five Week Auction
The Bank of England on Thursday announced its intention to alleviate current concerns about the deterioration of the credit market again and announced a bid of <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion in a five-week auction at a basic interest rate of 5.75%, a bid that is not in effect.
"In an effort to alleviate concerns that the conditions in the financial markets will be very unfavourable at the end of the year and give banks more confidence in how to secure their cash position for this period," the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its reserves at the time of the 6th day, which will be held at the time of the scheduled reserve.
The bank says that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed on the financial market on December 6 at 12.15 GMT until January 10, at the basic interest rate.
It seems to be the first time BOE has pumped cash into the financial market in a five-week open market operation.
They usually take a week.
In its communication, the BOE said it was "remaining ready to take further measures to keep interest rates" of interbank loans at the same level as its core rate.
The inter-day interbank interest rate on Wednesday was 5,829 %.
The three-month interest rate stood at 6.6%, the highest since September 18.
Since the start of the summer financial crisis, the amounts placed on the financial market by the Bank of England have been linked to tax rates that have distracted banks from using this offer.
According to certain speculations reinforced by the development of the pound against the euro, many preferred to opt for the amounts placed on the European Central Bank's financial market with lower rates and more guaranteed discretion.
UMP (Union pour un mouvement populaire, Union pour le mouvement populaire) and NC (Nouveau Centre, New Centre) refuse to address Socialists’ (PS) purchasing power proposals
UMP and Nouveau Centre on Thursday refused to discuss individual paragraphs of the Socialist draft law on purchasing power, which equals rejection of the text.
On the agenda, the text of the bill was received within the framework of the so-called socialist "nest" (meeting initiated by the individual MEPs) and contained a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the PS Presidency, among which was an increase in the employment premium of the PP by 50% and the right-of-way employment rate.
Since the UMP and the NC voted against the discussion of individual paragraphs (180 votes against 115), the meeting was closed after a general debate, which became an opportunity for an exchange of views, sometimes more vibrant, between the majority and the opposition, a few hours before Sarsch's television.
MP Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his club will again submit these proposals in full in the form of amendments to the amendment to the Finance Act, which the House will discuss next week.
A new festival is born
As a result of many speculation that C3 Presents is setting up a new festival in Philadelphia, this promoter/producer announced the Vineland Festival in New Jersey in collaboration with the Festival of the Republic of the UK host Melvin Benn.
"For our company, it's an honor to work with a person who has inspired the current festival movement in America without effort," said Charlie Jones of C3 on Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland in New Jersey is a summer camping destination.
The festival is scheduled to take place from August 8 to 10 on a private farm of 500 acres, about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of the Republic Festival, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the most recognized festival organizers in the world.
In 1989, he was the chairman of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts 80,000 people each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added to his Leeds Festival portfolio, and in 2006 the Festival Republic founded the Latitude Festival in Henham Park, Suffolk.
Starting in 2002, Melvin Benn, as co-owner, is also in charge of production, license and organizing tasks at the Glastonbury Festival, which today has a capacity of up to 177,500 people.
C3’s Charlie Jones calls Glastonbury “the most inspiring event he’s ever experienced” and says his company and Melvin Benn are working together to give the region a European-style festival event.
"Originally we chose Philadelphia as a market and together with the Fairmount Parks Commission we worked hard to set up a festival in downtown Philadelphia," said Charlie Jones.
"I worked with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about the project.
“Unfortunately, because of the current leadership of the city, we have become involved in politics,” added Charlie Jones.
Fortunately, we had the opportunity to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are about to set up a great festival in an exceptional location that will eventually serve the people of Philadelphia.”
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago’s Grant Park in 2005, after being featured on the Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2002.
Gross revenues for both events for 2007 were <0x24>9.8M and <0x24>11.3M.
Both of these festivals are held in urban areas.
“The European model of Melvin Benn’s festival takes place in the countryside, while our festivals take place in green spaces in cities,” says Charlie Jones.
“Our goal is to combine both concepts in a way that creates an impression of a rural festival in Europe and a city in America.”
Vineland is located about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The municipality of Vineland, including the mayor, is excited to support the event,” said Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but claims, "that they are advantageous enough to allow them to invest in such an event and welcome the festival that will have, hopefully, a long-lasting one."
Charlie Jones says the capacity of the festival is "very high", similar to the capacity of the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, which will accommodate 80,000 people.
He says that invitations have already been sent to the groups, but nothing can still be confirmed at the time when the program is only being put to the press.
“Vineland will have a rock spirit, but the music will be varied so that we can attract a wide spectrum of viewers as much as possible,” says Carlie Jones.
The C3 partners, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award in the last year of the Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal is facing the Terminator.
It’s not easy to attract Hollywood film studios to Montreal when the Terminator himself opposes it.
This convincing mission is one of the tasks of the delegate.
However, his mandate is "politically demanding" because California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger condemns "runaway productions".
Is it hard to get the "Governor" into the guts??
“You have to be careful, it’s the industry that decides where it’s going.
If he finds that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, he'll go there.
Our job is to offer those that they will consider to be the best,” he said.
Honour for festivals
For now, however, Denise Turcotte’s promotion of the local film is a priority.
He's already started to hunt for the Oscars.
At all West Coast festivals, whether they are festivals in Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it’s about presenting Quebec films, alerting them to them, and ensuring that the directors provide interviews.
The age of darkness had a good publicity at the 30th anniversary of the Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on sale in Santa Monica and will be presented in November at the 30th anniversary of the Starz Denver Film Festival.
This month Québec also presented four short films and four full-length films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Will there be a marathon at the end of the year? Experts split 'subprime' crisis
Less than five weeks remain until the end of the administrative year and the investors are already waiting for the traditional marathon to take place at the end of the year.
This year, however, experts are not sure if it will happen.
Banif believes that "statistically, December has a positive course on the stock market".
However, it is not advisable to make forecasts based solely on statistics, in particular because, in the current context, markets raise certain doubts, at least in the short term."
These experts do not assume that the stock market is shifting in recent weeks, and they state that "the stock market maintains the existence of liquidity that is willing to invest due to the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially the strong income of the stock market, influenced by both the price and the quality of the turnover.
Therefore, they believe that the exchange will have a rather calm course, not without volatility, "particularly because the impact of the likely fall in rates of the Fed (Federal Reserve System), given the high level of oil prices and the risk of stimuli to inflationary pressures, is unknown".
Javier Barrio, head of BPI’s sales in Spain, agrees that it’s not the right time for a bold statement that a marathon will take place.
“There are not too many reasons to be happy,” the expert assures.
Ibex lost almost 4% of the peaks recorded on November 8, when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative opinion.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 could end the year by a little closer to 16,000 points due to the regrouping of portfolios and traditional pension insurance deposits that occur every year during this time period.
However, the expert suggests that this year will be a bit different, as he believes that the marathon will take place earlier, in the second week of December after the extended weekend on the occasion of Constitution Day.
The analyst does not believe that volatility would affect the direction of the market.
Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, also estimates that we are approaching the technical level and “that’s why we could observe a reflection of the index triggered by US reports on the consequences of the credit market crisis.”
Analysts believe that these results will be positive.
Analysts agree in the selection of titles that will ensure that Ibex reaches new maximum ratings.
Solana from Intermoney confirms that "this year is the time for strong titles".
This expert would include both major banks and some construction companies in the portfolio, “because by this time, the energy sector will be very expensive.”
Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco, on the other hand, ensures that the increases will go hand in hand with banking and the industrial sector.
Construction companies will also be able to get rich in this marathon if it happens.
“ACS has been re-opening positions for months and we hope that other construction companies such as Ferrovial and the FCC will follow the same path,” explains the expert.
Cyclical consumption will be at the forefront in the last part of the year due to an increase in sales during the Christmas sales period.
This expert, on the other hand, believes that the technology will also be doing very well, even if they are not too represented in the Spanish market in this field.
Five times over the course of seven years
In the last seven years, December has only been a month of decline in two cases.
The real marathon at the end of the year took place in 2003, in the administrative year when the stock markets ended the crisis caused by the burst of a technological bubble.
This year, when Ibex 35 regained 28.17%, December saw a 6.68% increase.
We will also see if 2007 will be the fifth year in a row (i.e., Ibex has increased 8.36% since January) and if he will manage to have his marathon at the end of the year.
Two hundred branches of the bank Popular will be open 12 hours from Friday to Saturday
Banka Popular has decided to modernize most of its branches.
A total of two hundred, located in the most remote parts of Spain.
These branches operated under the popular max brand are a big change for the bank.
The same goes for the other Spanish entities, as it is the first group to make such a jump and bet on the continuous opening hours of their branches until 20.30 and open on Saturday from 10 to 20.30.
BBVA, another group that has also repeatedly assured that it wants to extend the opening hours of its branches, has not yet decided on this step.
In the meantime, he plans to conclude an agreement with trade unions to cancel the opening hours of 75% of its branches on Saturday in exchange for an extension of the opening hours by one afternoon, although not for the public.
The results of this experience will be decisive for other entities to join this initiative that supports opening hours of trades or not.
This is precisely the goal of the project that the Bank has set out.
Get individual clients who go to these places for their purchases, small and medium-sized companies, businessmen and shops from selected streets, where there will be the opening of branches.
The Bank wants to open 200 of these branches across Spain in about 18 months, as it is not about opening new branches, but just editing existing ones.
For this reason, the bank modernizes the branches it already has in the business zones by adapting them to the profile of clients in the individual streets.
This is complemented by a different concept of the branch space and a new, more up-to-date design in lighter colors.
<0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera, managing director of the bank, said the restructuring would not be a major investment, but a larger recruitment of staff, as it shifted from six employees to eight to nine.
The branches will even be equipped with meeting rooms for small and medium-sized companies and will also sell non-financial products.
Positive experience for the group.
Banka Popular has already tested this initiative in three branches in Madrid.
And it was a positive experience, explains <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera.
Selected were branches in the streets of Madrid Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía, and according to Rivera it seems to have been a happy choice.
Banka Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And another 60 immigrant specialists, operated under the Mundocredit brand, also have a very long opening hours and are open even on Sundays and holidays.
PopularMax branches will not follow the BBVA model, where a number of its branches offer for sale a wide range of non-financial products.
“We don’t want to compete with our clients,” Rivera said.
They have just agreed with Telefónica to sell mobile phones through external staff.
Telecinco doubles the value of its rival Antenna 3 for the first time on the stock market
We did it.
In this sentence yesterday, Paolo Vasile, CEO of Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction at the conclusion of the trade, when he found that the TV he controls doubled the value of his rival Antena 3.
There was only one thing that made him happy: 'What I'm sorry about is that it didn't happen because we grew more, but because we fell less.'
And he stressed that, thanks to the weak market, “we have fallen less.”
Yesterday, Telecinco ended trading with a move of 2.54 percent.
This profit has shifted their losses over the last part of the year to 15.66%.
The stock market value of this company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of capital) with Vocenta’s shares (an additional 13%), according to Bloomberg’s data, is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4,488.88 million.
Its competitor Antena 3, which fell by 1.52 percent yesterday and fell by 40.5 percent since January, has a half-value of 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other telecommunications companies estimated is 3.571 billion for Sogecable, 2,518.53 million for Prisa (publisher Cinco Días) and 1.779 billion for Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenna 3 is offered, because 'we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do in the same market, at what price, and how we evaluate it in tracking."
Telecinco announced last week that it expects this year to be the first television channel to exceed billions of gross advertising revenues, according to Giuseppe Tringali, CEO of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the group’s advertising subsidiary.
If the expected figures were actually met, this TV channel would record an increase in advertising turnover of 3.6% this year compared to 965.4 million in 2006.
At the same time, in the first nine months of the year, the net revenue of Antenna 3 increased by 1.6% (and reached 734.4 million), while the net revenue of this television increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts are focusing on for Telecinco’s best relative development on the stock market is the increased pay-out it has maintained so far: in 2006, this company, chaired by Alejandro Echevarría, distributed 100% of its profit among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that although it is soon to be decided, this coefficient could change after the purchase of 33 % of Endemol together with its parent company Mediaset.
“We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always reported a lot more.
This year, I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders, with whom we have already increased the value of 33% of Endemol.
According to analysts, the market is currently experiencing some fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its estimates of Telecinco’s profit by 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
This is due to the fact that the projected revenue growth has stopped from 0.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company decreased the expected profit of Antenna 3 by 4.5 % in 2008 and 7.5 % in 2009.
3 opinions
Articles 1 and 2
Ibersecurities: recommends buying both securities primarily based on increased dividend yield and long-term sustainable potential.
Article 2
Caja Madrid: rated Telecinco better than Antenna 3 because of its ‘read preferences’ and growing trade.
Article 3
JPMorgan: In both cases, it recommends not overestimating them, as it faces 'similar threats' (oversized market and deteriorated economic environment).
Congress approves MiFID transposition effective from 1 November
At the same time as the parliamentary hearings, which were concluded today by a vote by Congress on the bills incorporated by the Senate in the bill, the government has submitted a public hearing of the regulation, which is developing the new law, in order for both to enter into force before the end of the year.
Representatives of each party have consistently highlighted the efforts of MEPs and senators to negotiate and agree on the best standard to ensure the protection of investors and the detailed regulation of the activities of entities necessary for the effective functioning of the markets.
The MiFID Directive, which regulates the Securities Trading Act, envisages the modernisation of financial markets while at the same time strengthening investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the State Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and supporting cooperation between the individual supervisory authorities of the European Union.
This new regulation will enable the provision of financial advisory services to both specialized companies and natural or legal persons and create a new type of financial services companies (ESIS), financial advisory companies (AFIs) that join companies with securities carriers, brokerage firms and pricing agencies.
In addition, the number of systems for the performance of financial instruments is expanded so that multilateral trading systems and order internalisation systems are connected to regulated secondary markets, which will compete with current stock brokers.
The law further obliges investment service providers to disseminate on the market information on key aspects of their business profile, exposure to risk and ways of dealing with risk, and requires a record of all operations performed to simplify the supervision by CNMV.
During the hearing at the Congressional Trade Commission, several adjustments have been included, among which it stands out that the securitized claims are considered a "complex" financial instrument due to the high risk to the investor, which has been demonstrated by the U.S. high-risk approach.
In addition, the transposition of the directive was used to legally define the functions that may hold bachelor's degrees in economics and business management 30 years after the Royal Decree was approved in 1977, which outlines the professional functions reserved for economists.
At the same time, the Senate has included the creation of new professions in the financial sector, such as an intermediary that will work externally, will not require permission from the CNMV and will be able to provide products trading services and acquiring clients for different investment firms at the same time.
Harmonized ISC increased by five-tenths to 4.1% in November
This indicator, which later serves Eurostat to calculate the European Union inflation index, provides preliminary information on how prices in Spain evolved during the month of November.
Its publication corresponds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) to provide data in time and quality comparable to those achieved in the United States.
This preliminary indicator shall be calculated using the same process used for the Harmonised Consumer Price Index, but using different statistical modelling methods for estimating information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The Spanish INE (State Statistical Institute) recalled that the information provided by this preliminary indicator is merely indicative and therefore does not necessarily correspond to the final data that will be made available on 14 December this year.
"ISC will continue to remain at a relatively high level"
The second Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy Pedro Solbes said the November ISC increase to 4.1% was a "temporary figure", but predicted that the price index would continue to be relatively "high" in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes clarified in congressional polls that "even if it is not a favourable figure", Spain's inflation differential against the monetary union is still "more or less" in the last two years.
He also explained that November was "less surprising" than the previous month, when the government did not expect such a high increase.
"We expected a value of around 4%," the Minister of Economy said in a statement.
Virgin plans to make <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>42 billion with Northern Rock in three years
Since Northern Rock was in crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England, its deposits have fallen by more than 50% to <0xC2><0xA3>12 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16.8 billion).
At the time, the bank managed record deposits worth more than <0xC2><0xA3>25 billion, which gradually declined over the course of two and a half months despite the government offering a 100% guarantee for the money and extending it until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which replaces the name of the entity with its Virgin Money trademark, needs to earn about a quarter of the revenue invested in British banks over the next three years to earn the remaining <0xC2><0xA3>18 billion, reaching the target of <0xC2><0xA3>30 billion.
Richard Branson’s magnate group, known in the United Kingdom for its striking advertising campaigns, plans to spend <0xC2><0xA3>50 million (about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70 million) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve its predecessor.
Bank Northern Rock this week marked the Virgin consortium's offer, which consists of three more companies, such as the one that prefers to save them from bankruptcy.
Mayor of Totana arrested for alleged corruption practices in construction
The Civil Guard detained the current mayor of the Murcian city of Totana (from the People's Party) in the early hours of today because of his alleged involvement in corrupt construction practices that were uncovered this week.
A local police chief and one of the city’s secretaries were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales, the current People's Deputy and by then mayor of the town, who, according to investigative sources addressed to Cadena SER, could have been the 'head' of the entire company.
Police continue to monitor the buildings of the town hall and the construction commission and no further arrests are excluded in the coming hours.
In addition, lawyer Juan Morales, the main suspect of corruption practices in construction, was accused of being uncovered earlier this week.
As Cadena SER reported yesterday, the lawyer of 'people' MEP Juan Morales, who was checked, was arrested on leaving Morales's residence with important documents related to corruption.
In addition, according to investigative sources, Morales’ alleged selection of commissions for his signature of the construction agreement with the Galician construction company, which has been requalified for 200 hectares of land, is the subject of the investigation.
Eight people are currently detained.
Bono accepted the offer to be the leader of the Toledo candidate and, if they win, to preside over Congress
Former Defence Minister José Bono accepted the offer of the Prime Minister and Secretary General of Socialists José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero to stand at the head of the PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party) candidacy in Toledo, in the event of a social outcry.
This was announced at a press conference by the secretary of the PSOE for the organization José Blanco and Bono himself, after a meeting with Zapater, which took place this afternoon at the party’s federal headquarters.
The chief executive told the former minister that in political life "it is important to count on the best" and Bono "is among the best".
He further noted that "yes, it seems" that this politician from La Mancha will be the candidate of the Socialist Party for the president of Congress if the Socialists win the next elections.
Bono would be replaced as Congress president by Manuel Marín, who on November 15 announced his decision not to run in the next general election and to abandon his active political career in order to devote himself to the fight against climate change in university education.
The former prime minister admitted that the prime minister constantly urged him to return to the supreme policy he left two years ago.
He also said that just as citizens know who will be Deputy Minister of Economy if the PSOE wins the election, his party wanted to announce in a "transparent form" who will preside over Congress.
If Bono takes on this role, he hopes to turn the House into a "house of respect and not a hug or scream" and aims to "become more and more like citizens".
"Unfortunately, the only place in Madrid where there is no peace and quiet talk is Congress, the prime minister in the Senate has been interrupted 26 times on one occasion."
Similarly, he spoke commendable words to the address of current President Manuel Marín and "his good work" and yet did not want to imagine himself in his place, so as not to reduce himself to what his opponents might consider a "greatness".
Climate Propaganda
Since the anti-climate movement is subject to ruthless persecution, both those who are skeptical of its predictions and those who prefer other political and social struggles must show firm cohesion.
In addition, to have a leader of the movement who is the prime minister like Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even intends to sign a "new treaty with the planet".
This proposal forces him to explain why his government’s actions or inactions have contributed significantly to Spain’s failure to comply with the Kyoto Protocol in the European Union.
Who is responsible for this failure, in which sectors it is happening and why his government, the government of the treaty, has not prevented it.
In addition, it forces him to explain as clearly as possible to the Spaniards what measures he intends to take to curb climate change.
Which companies will thereby be damaged, which habits of the population will have to be changed, what energy savings, both individual and collective, we will have to accept and what economic consequences it will have.
In other words, who makes sacrifices and who pays to save the planet.
But we did not expect such explanations, nor do we expect.
It is because we have to sacrifice and pay.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Expensive, inconvenient and threatening business and private accounts.
Even one cent of the price of gasoline, proposed by the PSOE (Spanish Labour Socialist Party), seemed to Zapater so risky in terms of the election that he rushed to refuse it.
In other words, it’s about saving the planet so that it doesn’t stand anything, pure propaganda, passwords that lack any real meaning.
Impressive phrases, commissions, committees, minutes and new posts.
And contracts with the planet; this gentleman is so useful for the election campaign that he does not even speak, he does not blame, he does not demand anything, but he is the decoration of the fairy tale and excites it.
If it is limited to being just a virtual contractor and does not ask us to ride a bike and cool with a windshield.
Mayor and local police chief Totany detained for suspected corruption practices during construction
According to investigative sources, the Civil Guard arrested the mayor of the Murcian city of Totana, the "man" of José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the town hall and one businessman in hospitality, for suspected of committing crimes during construction.
The mayor was arrested at his residence and transferred to the town hall, in whose premises he is now located, along with a number of police officers who also went to the Construction Commission and the City Enterprise for the Management of Industrial Lands and Apartments.
These three arrests were added to the six that took place in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid last Monday in an operation linked to the requalification of 2 million hectares of agricultural land suitable for construction, so that the Galician company Nuaria could lay down a period of over 4,000 years in illegal mining.
In addition, two more people were not arrested, but are charged in a shortened trial in the first instance court of Totana.
The first six detainees were brought to trial today.
According to information sources, the former mayor of Totana and today a member of the Autonomous Parliament for the People's Party (PP), Juan Morales, are under investigation.
His former wife, the owner of a real estate office, registered today in Totanas, as well as his current girlfriend, who lives in Murcia, the capital of the autonomous region.
Manuel N. A., director and owner of the Nuaria Group, a lawyer and businessman from Viga, was arrested in Nigrán (Province Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M. G., director of Suelo de Inmonauar, which belongs to the group and through which payments were transferred.
The investigation is carried out by the Crimes Group in the construction of the Operational Central Unit of the Civil Guard, whose members, in addition to the arrests, also carried out eleven inspections, mostly in companies related to the detainees, with headquarters in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Ponteprovéd<0xC5><0x99>e, Las Rozas (Madrid).
At that time, only one person was imprisoned in Totane, in the area of the well-known owner of the company for poultrymeat products, who could serve as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was entrusted with the construction of the largest residential complex in the Murcian city of Totana, which would represent the construction of more than 5,000 houses, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totane, which was requalified and its project was to double the settlement of the village, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group is made up of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which are dedicated to supporting the real estate market, Conycase, which manages parking in the streets of Coruna, Venezuela, and on the square Fernando el Católico in the city of Vigo, Hogartel, which is dedicated to direct marketing of the states, the mon<0xC4><0x91>ajs and the preconceas.
And it happens.
Articles 1 and 2
If you don't mind, we'll leave the Book of the Month aside and maybe we'll be attacked by other awards and competitions in the meantime.
I've got something in my head.
People, life is a change.
Of course, you can come up with ideas.
Article 2
Our Finnish correspondent sends us this comment from yesterday’s edition of the most important Finnish newspapers Helsingin Sanomat (by the way, at the beginning of the PISA report on the level of education in the world), which refers to what the newspapers printed on the 18th of November, the day of the Black Friday.
"The content of the subject of philosophy has penetrated into public discussions in connection with the tragedy at the school in Jokela.
The murder of the victims, a high school student, quoted in his messages the work of Plato and Nietzsche.
Pekka Elo, the Education Adviser responsible for the subject of philosophy, asked on the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper pages that professors take a critical view of Plato and argued that it is not necessary to discuss Nietzsche in the compulsory basic course of philosophy at school.
Article 3
One colleague informs about the introduction of a criminal offence of downloading from the Internet into the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading a single song would be a crime at a rate from six months to one year.
On the other hand, if you sell a board in a store for less than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400, this is considered a mere violation (<0xC2><0xA7> 623.1).
B. If you withdraw up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,000 from the store, theft is already a crime, but the criminal rate is lower than for downloading (<0xC2><0xA7> 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal the car and return it after 40 hours, the penalty rate is still lower than for downloading (<0xC2><0xA7> 244.1)
D. It is less serious to participate in wrestling than compact shifts.
Participation in the insolvency has a rate of three months to one year (<0xC2><0xA7> 154 of the Criminal Code) and for the exchange of compacts would be a rate of six months to two years
(Section 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment in employment is considered under section 184.2 of the Criminal Code as less serious than downloading a film to a DVD.
F. Unauthorized distribution of copyrighted films is punishable rather than the provision of pornographic material to juveniles (<0xC2><0xA7> 186).
So if my colleague isn't wrong, someone's got a hand, and that's right.
Article 4
My nursing doctor has told me one of his strange research papers called “Money Causes Brain Activation, Especially if Others Get Less.”
Whether the feelings caused by the monthly salary of employees depends on how much their colleagues earn.
The research was conducted at the University of Bonn using magnetic resonance imaging tomograph and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and head of the Neurocognition Display group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: "The biggest activation occurred when the research participant reacted correctly and his colleague wrongly."
The researchers observed that if both were successful, they would receive the same salary, the activation was mild, but when one received the double, the activation was higher.
I really don't know if this conclusion required so much science.
Prosecutor of the Balkans
For eight years, Carla del Ponte has been cruelly persecuted by the State Prosecutor’s Office of the Hague Court of Justice for a Balkan war criminal.
Her mandate expires at the end of the year and Carla will leave with mixed feelings, as the main culprits of the massacre in Srebrenica, in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were killed, former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karad<0xC5><0xBE>i<0xC4><0x8D>, are the main culprits of the massacre in Srebrenica.
Their names are on the list from which he took the name of the documentary film by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach "Carlin's List" (2006, not listed in Spain), which tracks the pace of the detective thriller from Belgrade to New York to the work of the Swiss prosecutors, the state prosecutors and prosecutors.
What insurance is suitable for me?
Car insurance, which protects the driver in the event of an accident. is a significant expense, which depends on various factors such as age, condition, gender, length of hold of the driver's license, the type of vehicle to be insured or its use, etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing a car model.
First of all, we need to clarify what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insurer.
This obligation takes the form of an insurance contract, which provides that the insurance company will receive the agreed insurance amount in a certain amount for taking responsibility for the payment of damages in the event of an insurance event.
Insurance is the price of insurance, which is determined with regard to various factors such as age, condition, gender, length of hold of the driver's license, type of vehicle that is insured or its use, etc.
Insurance companies set their prices based on statistics, so the higher the probability of an accident, the higher the insurance rate.
For this reason, both people over the age of 25 and women have to pay lower insurance, as statistics show that they have a lower risk index due to their prudence.
In the same way, on the basis of checks, insurance companies concluded that people living in marriage have fewer accidents than freelancers.
The way the vehicle is used will affect the frequency of the ride, and thus the likelihood of an accident.
With the increase in the frequency of rides, the likelihood increases.
There are many variables that insurance companies consider when determining the price of the insurance.
Therefore, the driver must carefully study the situation in order to choose the insurance that best fits his insurer profile.
Here we will show you the most important variables for choosing one or more types of insurance, which, in addition to meeting the type of insurance, will also be at a reasonable price.
People under the age of twenty-five face various disadvantages such as little driving experience and short possession of a driver’s license when they want to negotiate insurance at an affordable price.
Although ideal for good coverage is insurance against all risks, there are also cheaper options.
The most cautious drivers can choose insurance against all risks with insurance discount so that they get insurance coverage for all risks, but at a more affordable price.
This type of contract would involve the participation of the client in the payment of the insurance event.
“Part of the insurance event payment that the client will provide will be determined in advance when determining the insurance price, which will be higher, the lower the participation would be,” explains Luis Noguera, chief executive officer of First Europe in Spain, an internet insurance broker.
Another option is insurance extended to other traffic participants so that the client is insured against the damage caused to other persons, but not against the damage to his own car.
In addition, he would be insured against theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
Recommendations.
If you are under the age of twenty-five, try to be careful and avoid accidents as much as possible, as this will affect your bonus and allow you to reduce your insurance in the future.
The bonus is a reduction in the basic rate that the insurance company has.
On the other hand, malus is an increase in the aforementioned basic rate.
"The bonus and the malus will depend on the insurance company and its profits.
If the insurance company has a good year, it will be able to afford to increase the bonus,” explains Noguera.
After exceeding the twenty-five-year limit, it is easier for drivers to negotiate insurance, as the client’s risk index decreases, thanks to the experience gained.
For this reason, it is most recommended to negotiate insurance against all risks with a discount.
"Young people can't usually take advantage of the experiences they've gained in advance when there's an accident, and not even when driving," says the director of the European company in Spain, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of the accident.
However, if the client is married but has no children yet, it is better to negotiate insurance against all risks, if the economic situation of the client allows.
Families with children are considered by the insurers as a client with the lowest risk index and therefore their premiums will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be insurance against all risks with an insurance discount (which could amount to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300) or with a high bonus, insurance extended to other operators, starting with the third year from the purchase of the vehicle.
“Their driving is quieter and their purchasing power is higher, so they can afford to get the highest discount,” says Luis Noguera.
Pensioners are advised to have insurance against all risks with an insurance discount (which amounts to 150 euros) or insurance extended to other operators if a high bonus has been achieved.
It should be said that car insurance is something important not only because it protects the driver in the event of an accident, but also because it represents a significant cost, which is a downside reason for proper consideration of the insurance options that would best suit us in terms of the person’s situation.
Celtic tries to score at AC Milan, which means eight finals
AC Milan and Celtic will measure their strengths on Tuesday at San Siro Stadium in an effort to score a point they lack to reach their respective Champions League goals, as for Italy it would be the first and for the Scots it would decide to place.
The Italians have ten points and have already secured a move in the fifth draw in Portugal, while the Celtic has nine points, but he needs one more to make sure he doesn’t get a six-point Chess player ahead of him, who will play with Benfika, who has four.
These two D-Group matches will be played a week before the end of the sixth round, as AC Milan must play in the Intercontinental Cup in Japan, where it will play thirteenth in the semifinals for the first time, in an attempt to move to the final, which is played sixteen.
So this group will be closed earlier than the rest and the indecisive result at Giuseppe Meazzy stadium seems to be the most likely, even though both teams will try to fight for the victory, because the Italians will not want to tactic on the home ground and the Celtic would be behind the axes, knowing that
The team of Gordon Fearan could be enough for the move even if the Chess player doesn’t win, but he can’t count on it, because at the same number of points the Ukrainians who lost in Glasgow last week (2:1), but won in the first straight (2:0).
And so AC Milan players will try to ruin the night for the Scots, who believe they will get to the semi-finals for the second time in the reorganized Champions League just as they beat them in the same match in the previous competition with the goal of Kaka in the extension (1:0) after a 0:0 state in the base game.
To hope that the "rossoners" will win will be the Chess player for whom the prize is won only if Celtic loses, both for progress to the eighth and for staying in UEFA.
Benfica, although it is the last and has no chance to continue in the top European competition, could reach third place with one win, so she would play in UEFA.
The first concert of the Spice Girls tour was attended by 20,000 people in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls started their first tour in Vancouver (Canada) before 20,000 spectators in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) just before they started their concert at the GM's "Spoto<0xC5><0x82>óv<0xC3><0xBD>é" stadium.
Approximately 20,000 people bought tickets to attend the concert, which also included a video recounting the group’s history that triggered the sensation in the late 1990s.
The return and world tours take place at the same time as the new album released by EMI in Spain brings a selection of their major hit songs, as well as two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
Five Spice Girls appeared on stage with decorated bracelets given to them by their husband "Posh Spice", British footballer David Beckham.
This athlete was in an audience that flooded GM Place, despite the nervous Victoria banning him a few days ago.
Before the start of the show, Victoria Beckham said of the British star that "he hasn't seen our costumes at all, so I'm nervous about what he thinks about the show."
"Sporty Spice", whose departure from the group in 1998 "due to differences between us" caused the group's dissolution two years later, also expressed its nervousness when meeting with journalists two hours before the start of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw the world’s public opinion changed, the opinion on Spice Girls changed.
And I thought why not, so I'm glad I made a decision," Chisholm said of the group's reunion, which she broke up nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, "things got better and we all love each other very much."
However, a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
So at first, according to CTV, the group flew to Vancouver with the Virgin Airlines special.
When they arrived at the airport, the army was waiting for them.
He has a total of seven children.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will perform in California (USA), San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
It will be performed in Madrid on 23 December.
Concerns about new gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
There is a dispute between Russia and Ukraine about the prices of natural gas, thereby increasing the risk that Russian supplies of this fuel to western Europe may be affected.
Most of the Russian fuel exported to the European Union (EU) is piped through Ukraine and any dispute between the two countries is closely monitored.
Kiev warned that if Moscow raises gas prices to Ukraine, Russia will charge higher transit fees.
The previous dispute between the two last year reduced supply to EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state-owned gas monopoly, Gazprom, are trying to agree on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom says Ukraine will have to pay more because it has agreed to pay up to 50% more for the gas it receives from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say this could mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for its supplies from Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states during the negotiations," Ukrainian Minister of Economy Anatoly Kinach told Reuters.
“The changes in gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit fees (to western Europe) via Ukraine.”
The last major dispute between Moscow and Kiev led to a reduction in supply from Gazprom to Ukraine in January 2006.
This caused a devastating drop in exports to western Europe, which sharply increased prices.
Russian gas accounts for one-quarter of the supply to the European Union.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but most of them remain inadequately exploited.
As a result, Gazprom is replenishing its own gas supplies from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asian republics.
NHS "must check foreign employees"
The controller said that the Scottish Chambers of the NHS must improve the controls of criminal records on non-European employees.
Recommendations from President Robert Black’s Supreme Control Office came after a foreign doctor operating in Scotland was linked to the June attacks at Glasgow Airport.
Mr. Black is also concerned that the Scottish NHS does not have an accurate idea of the amount of foreign personnel it employs.
But his report stressed that the other key checks were carried out fine on a sample of five health authorities.
The President of the Supreme Supervisory Authority immediately after the June attacks at Glasgow Airport was interested in the personnel obtained from countries outside the European Economic Area.
Eighty-eight-year-old Bilal Abdullah, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was detained at the airport after someone rented a Jeep to the doorstep of the main terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared at the Central Criminal Court using a video camera accused of connecting to attempted bombings in the UK.
The NHS Chambers are expected to inspect foreign personnel in terms of qualifications, experience and authorization for work in the UK prior to its employment.
Although the Scottish Health Commission uses Disclosure Scotland to verify criminal records, the Agency has no authority to obtain such information outside the UK.
The President’s report of the Supreme Audit Office says, among other recommendations, that the commission should be guided by the Criminal Records Bureau directives that help employers with controls in several countries.
"While we found that some of the staff records contained evidence of these checks, they are not carried out on a regular basis," the report said.
Mr. Black said that the Scottish NHS in many ways agrees with its own pre-employment verification policy, but also added: "Our report highlights areas in which the system could be improved to ensure the availability of accurate information about the amount of foreign personnel."
BMA Scotland President Dr. Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" that pre-employment checks would identify potential NHS employees who might commit a terrorist act in the future.
"The report suggests that current pre-employment checks in the Scottish NHS are working well and it is not clear what further value those comments will bring," he said.
The Scottish health authorities said they currently have 1,161 foreign workers, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the President of the Supreme Supervisory Authority pointed out that these figures would probably be higher because the Commission had a problem identifying staff with residence permits.
The survey also found that the NHS control procedures in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are largely implemented.
They included passport checks, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently revising the NHS Pre-Employment Controls Policy and Directives for Foreign Workers.
Health Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: "I wanted to arrange this work immediately after the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport."
She also added that the Scottish Government, in conjunction with the Health Commissions, is considering the recommendations of this report and will ensure that best practices are included in the updated pre-employment control guidelines for all staff, including foreign personnel, which it plans to issue next month.
Joy Division has won film awards

Rock music was the focus of another award-winning film - because the Julien Temple film about singer Clash Joe Strummer won the award for best documentary.
Viggo Mortensen won the award for Best Actor for his role as the driver of the Russian Mafia boss in the London thriller David Cronenberg's Eastern Promise.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing hard guys, won the Richard Harris Award for his extraordinary contribution to British film.
This fiftieth man, including the films Scum, Nil By Mouth, and Sexy Beast, is currently filming another piece of Indiana Jones - The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud of this award, named after the star of the films Camelot and Harry Potter Harris, who died in 2002.
“People like Richard Harris and Albert Finney have opened the door for people like me,” he added.
“I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He’s my man, the great actor of my time, and I’m very honored.”
The Independent Film Awards, known as Bify, are awarded by a jury in which filmmakers, actors and festival organizers meet.
Bif patrons include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia Arrested 208 People for Terrorist Conspiracy
Saudi Arabia announced yesterday that it had arrested 208 militants for joining cells in preparation for an immediate attack on oil facilities, as well as spiritual and security components.
State television, the largest oil exporter, said one of the cells wanted to invade rockets into the country.
The al-Qaeda sympathizers have led a campaign against the monarchy, the allies of the United States, since 2003, i.e. since the invasion of Iraq.
A television reporter said a cell of eight foreign-led militants was planning an attack on an oil plant in Ash-Sharqiyah province.
Saudi Arabia is building a 35,000-member rapid response unit to defend the facility from the failure of al-Qaeda attack on the world’s largest oil refinery in Abqaiqu in 2006.
The report cited a statement by the Ministry of Internal Affairs: 18 of the detainees belonged to a cell led by a "missile fire expert" that penetrated the country.
She also said the militants planned to fire eight shots into the kingdom.
Twenty-two detainees were expected to prepare for the murders of spiritual and security workers.
The government urged the clergy to try more to prevent the Saudis from going to Iraq to join al-Qaeda militants fighting with the Allied forces and the Shiite government backed by the United States, which the Sunni Saudis consider to be Kafka.
Al-Qaeda militants believe authorities have co-opted many clergymen in Saudi Arabia to support the royal family that controls the government.
The militants – supported by the Saudi leader al-Qaeda Osama bin Laden’s call to focus on the Western Saudi government – focused on foreign residential complexes, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This war has been a huge effort by the security forces in the past... five months," a spokesman for the Ministry of Interior told state television.
A 16-member "media cell" in Medina was also detained, aimed at promoting "Takfirian thought" - the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals that promotes violence against Muslims labeled as disbelievers and apostates.
Among the detainees were also 32 people accused of providing financial support to militants.
The climate on Venus may be a prospect for the future of the Earth
Yesterday, scientists announced that Venus could have once been a pleasant place for life.
Data from the orbiting European station shows that the planet is even more similar to Earth’s self-headed twins than previously thought.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor to Earth.
These two worlds are about the same size and orbit similarly, but Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, on Venus, conditions were similar to those on Earth and could have been habitable.
But the greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation and a lower rotation rate sent Venus on a completely different path of development.
Today, the planet is waterless, the temperature on the surface is hot enough to melt lead, and it is devastated by storms and hurricane-powered winds.
The findings from the European Space Agency’s Venus Express probe, which has been studying the planet for a year, provide a glimpse into how Earth could evolve in the event of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford and one of the leading Venus Express missions said: “It is becoming increasingly clear why the climate on Venus is so different than on Earth, even though the planets themselves are quite similar.
"Our new data allows us to compile a scenario in which Venus began as well as Earth, perhaps even with a habitable environment, billions of years ago."
Police have detained 'depleted uranium'
A kilogram of radioactive material, allegedly enriched with uranium, was detained yesterday by Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were detained and the material was being investigated.
He did not confirm that it was enriched with uranium, but said the substance could be sold for <0x24>1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>480,000).
Continued to complete
Mitt Romney said that it is not worthy for presidential candidates to answer questions from a snowman.
Nonetheless, Republican presidential candidates later agreed to a YouTube debate, in which ordinary voters uploaded their queries to the video and handed them over to the candidates.
None of the questions aired on Wednesday was as comic as a snowman who asked Democrats about global warming in the other party’s YouTube debate.
But questions and even answers this time reflected many on the state of the Republican Party heading for next year’s elections.
It’s unclear how exactly the CNN producers, one of the sponsors of the debate, selected the clips, which were then shown to aspirant candidates.
But the first half of the debate, the longest time devoted to a single topic, was focused on immigration.
This is one of the strongest Republican topics.
CNN asked a panel of indecisive voters to turn the disc when they heard something gratifying: the voter recorded peaks of approval when candidates spoke about hard border access.
The toughest and longest exchange of views took place between Rudy Giuliani, the main national candidate, and Mr. Romney, who slipped forward in the key early votes in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani tries to stifle the reputation of a man who, as a New York mayor, was soft on illegal immigrants.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his home.
These two matches were particularly urging when taxpayers asked if any of the candidates would support "amnesty" (to give illegal immigrants a normal status and the possibility of citizenship).
Other candidates, such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a congressman from Colorado, were able to put their little bit into the mill on the subject.
None of the two have a chance to be nominated, but both remain in the game perhaps because they started battling on the alarm due to immigration earlier and stronger than the others.
At least on immigration, candidates have the same opinion: more strict borders, no tolerance for illegal migrants.
This topic, along with concerns about toxic toys from China and other concerns with the surrounding world, helps Republicans forget or minimize the contradiction between libertins and Christian conservatives.
But the debate began to be very unpleasant when there were other topics.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he in the past supported possession of guns.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether the simulated heating technique should be considered torture.
One candidate asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
Mr. Giuliani came to the conclusion that although the Bible is his favorite book, it is likely that he does not literally believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another beggar asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee – who is now against all assumptions in a recent survey in Iowa due to his long-standing Christian conservatism – said the death penalty is unpleasant but necessary.
Under pressure to decide whether Jesus would agree, he said that Jesus was too smart to run, thus earning himself a laugh.
The relationship remains unusually open-ended.
Mr. Huckabee's rise in Iowa is covered by recent successes in earning money and Ron Paul's loud delights in Wednesday's debate.
The two sides are still unable to agree on more familiar and more traditional candidates, and they have withdrawn from the bottom.
In 1980 and 2000, one of the candidates unified the party very early and convincingly with a winning report of American size on the lips, staring at both sides.
This time, the page is fragmented and the result is far to clarity.
The Pain of Labour
Gordon Brown again found a trap he could fall into; his way out remains the same.
Although this is a custom in British political scandals, this is not particularly spicy.
It does not appear that any orders have been sold, no bills in the Paris hotel have been mysteriously paid, no extramarital fingers have been occupied.
But the barricaded Gordon Brown would have left without it being discovered that after four years, a wealthy businessman masked contributions from the ruling Labour Party of <0xC2><0xA3>650,000 (<0x24>1.3 million) under the name of other people, and that the party did not announce it.
Two months ago, when the prime minister avoided the election and insulted British intelligence by claiming that this decision had not been influenced by the investigation, there was hope to ensure a resilient and effective government.
Instead of being formulated by the increasingly humorous representative president of the Liberal Democrats, Mr. Brown once feared turned from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The unburdened rescue of the problem bank Northern Rock has shown weaknesses in driving and courtesy under fire.
The poorly thought out proposals to amend the tax code have united the firms against the government.
The loss of personal data in 25 million people has revealed an unimaginable administrative turmoil.
The three retired generals initiated the rebellion in the House of Lords; they protested against cuts in military spending, claiming that being the commander of the armed forces is part-time work.
Now there are many gifts from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, general secretary of the Labour (and their former guardian of internal discipline), has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown would be irreversibly headed towards his end.
Nevertheless, governments can reach a turning point, after which they find the rule of the heavy ones.
People don’t believe in politicians and don’t like them, but they usually reject their mistrust when the new party takes over.
When it becomes clear that a prime minister is unlikely to improve, and may not be in office for a long time, this is a move away: the state administration becomes a hole, the ministers start briefings, the press is looking for bad news, and the government becomes dissatisfied and dishonest.
In one direction, Mr Brown's position is particularly complex, as he cannot take the position of a new scoundrel compared to other political leaders.
As much as he would like to distance himself from Tony Blair, he was his first officer.
For example, problems with Northern Rock and the financial office records are linked to decisions that Mr. Brown made as Finance Minister.
And even if he wasn’t directly involved in Blairov’s small business, such as long investigations into the funding of political parties caused by “money worth,” voters can calmly believe he was.
However, Mr. Brown's troubles aren't as bad as they look.
These bullshits aren't as horrible as conservatives do.
As far as Mr. Bean is concerned, no one has died or been deliberately deceived.
And the treatment, however painful it may be, is to provide what Mr. Brown’s Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The latest move around political donations is a good example.
Garboid Mr. Abrahams, who compares his gifts to charity, says that he did not want any publicity for his charity.
That may be true, but the decision was not up to him.
The laws against the anonymity of large political donors are clear and exist for a simple reason: the public has the right to know who could buy access to those who rule in the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew about Mr. Abrahams's conduct, but did not know that it was illegal, will certainly be thoroughly interrogated; so will Jon Mendlesohn, the chief labour moneymaker, who learned of the scissors' gifts in October.
But so far, Mr. Brown is not at all confused; there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these skins, even though most of the payments were made only after his arrival in June.
The Prime Minister has done half of the work so far.
He quickly condemned this violation of the law by his own side, but diluted his determination by searching for a proven instrument, a commission to investigate the matter - also led by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, lessons are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it's a police case.
In addition, there are other things Mr Brown has to do, such as finding an independent permanent chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has not had one for six months, and moving towards a real reform of the financing of political parties.
This would require laborers who are in a tight position to cooperate with conservatives and perhaps even give up their special financial relationship with trade unions – bitter pills for a loyal party like Mr. Brown.
But he should face a few simple facts.
The Conservatives now have a decent leap in the polls; he has two years to win back the voters; and the only way to stand out is inconceivable integrity and high competence.
Carrot sharks
Does the subordinate mortgage crisis affect the U.S. credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, naturally the spinal cords begin to stir up.
As the U.S. real estate market is raging, predators have focused on the local credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts say that losses on credit cards could reach <0x24>99 billion if further variants of consumer loans were transferred from subordinate mortgages.
The signs of tension are obvious.
Increasing number of insolvency cases (with more than 30 days of late payment) and debited accounts (invoices that the provider deems inadmissible).
HSBC said last month it had lost <0x24>1.4 billion in consumer loans in the US market, also due to insolvent credit card loans.
But panic is still too soon.
There are still very few bankruptcies and inability to pay.
According to the rating agency Moody’s, the insolvency rate in the third quarter was almost a percentage point below the average.
Deteriorating rates can be partly explained by technical reasons.
The change in the U.S. Personal Bankruptcy Act of 2005 led to a sharp decline in the number of bankruptcies reported, which make up a large part of credit card losses; so the number of reports (and thus the number of depreciations) would increase regardless of whether the general conditions for bankruptcy were met.
The industry also shows a good maturity rate, which shows how much consumers pay out of their debts per month.
And trust in secured credit card securities is firm, despite the paralysis in other corners of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup predicts that their emissions for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
There are definitely direct ways to spread the infection between sub-hypothecities and the credit card market: when property loans are dried up, consumers are more likely to owe via credit cards.
However, credit card issuers prefer to look at the cash flow rather than the value of hand-held items, so falling home prices may not necessarily mean a change in the credibility of borrowers.
They can even be advantageous for loan providers.
Consumers’ motivation to pay off mortgages is declining when the value of their assets falls below the value of the loan; as a result, the debt on the cards moves up to the list of repayment priorities.
Card issuers are also able to respond faster and more flexibly to more stormy conditions than mortgage providers by changing interest rates or debt limits.
This would theoretically reduce the risk of rapid changes in the price of handkerchiefs.
“It’s not going to happen that one beautiful morning we would just re-evaluate all the loans,” said Gary Perlin, Capital One’s chief financial officer.
Although the risk of an explosion in the style of subordinate mortgages is low, the risk of gradual weakening is much more realistic.
If lower home prices and debt reductions push America into a recession, the credit card industry will cost before a darker future.
Watch out for those backyards.
British bankers plead guilty to Enron’s case
Three British bankers, who were to be tried for their roles in fraud linked to former financial executive Enron Andrew Fastow, changed their statement on Wednesday and confessed to their guilt.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby, and Gary Mulgrew were originally guilty of seven counts of fraud when they, together with Fastow in 2000, were supposed to participate in financial fraud -- enrichment at the expense of their employers -- denied.
They were supposed to be in court in January.
However, during the trial before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., everyone confessed to one fraud.
The case of these three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, figured on the front pages for the entire two years of the issuance process.
In the United States, their case is one of the unsuccessful parts of the investigation initiated after the 2001 Enron crash.
The indictment brought against them in 2002 warned Mr Fastow that he was the target of a government investigation into Enron’s crash.
The accusation against the bankers -- who earned the nickname "NatWest Trio" -- claims they came to Houston in 2000 to plot fraud together with Fastow and his former chief affiliate Michael Kopper.
Greenwich NatWest has invested in Enron’s partner branch controlled by Fastow, which was the architect of many Enron scams that sparked Enron’s spiral towards bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank rated its share in this branch to zero, but our three British knew it was actually of considerable value.
The company under Kopper's control bought the bank's share in this branch for <0x24>1 million.
Incriminating bankers paid Kopper <0x24>250,000 for his share in the company.
According to Fastow, Enron was falsely informed that the energy company would pay <0x24>20 million for its shares in the Greenwich NatWest subsidiary.
However, the <0x24>20 million actually went to those British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received <0x24>7.3 million and Fastow, Kopper and others improved by about <0x24>12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to two conspiracies for his role in the collapse of Enron.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a sentence of three years and one month at a facility in Texarkana.
All three Britons were free to move on a <0x24>1 million bail that ordered them to stay in the United States for the upcoming court.
Enron, once the country’s seventh largest company, went bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks could no longer hide billions of debts or report failing speculation as profit.
The collapse has eliminated thousands of jobs, more than <0x24>60 billion in market value and more than <0x24>2 billion in pension insurance.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their roles in the company’s fall.
Skilling has been sentenced to more than twenty-four years.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were deleted after he died of heart disease last year.
Moscow's non-impotence
The price of the Gulfstream G550, equipped with the Rolls-Royce engine and with sufficient fuel for non-stop flights from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at <0x24>54 million.
For some of the wealthy Russians, however, it is a small thing to go back.
"It can carry up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a representative of Gulfstream.
"But none of them are interested in so many places, because it's for a close family or a corporate president."
Mr. Firer was sitting at the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the Millionaire Exhibition, an orgy of four-day proven consumption at the Mammoth Exhibition Centre on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury vendors built their stands, hoping that the freshly enriched Russians would attract everything from mahogany-drawn yachts to diamond-decorated jets to cars for which they wouldn’t even be ashamed of 50 Cent.
Mr. Firer carefully looked at the bright orange Porsche in the side rack.
"It's a nice car, but it's fives and tens against us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second-largest private jet market."
On the waves of oil, money is poured into the Russian capital just as it was in Dallas.
“We went through the same stage in the 1980s, when some Americans became enormously wealthy and moved to Europe, where they looked at them as materialists,” said Marshall Goldman, a fourth-year listener at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard.
Like Saudi dispatchers from the 1970s and Japanese in the 1990s, Russians are becoming the most prominent spenders in the world.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their part on this Klondike.
Another place in Moscow this week attracted the luxury industry conference of Donatello Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of the LVMH group, to exchange ideas on how to sell expensive goods in markets such as the Russian one.
(The conference is hosted by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times Company.)
According to Forbes magazine, Russia has 53 billionaires with a total of <0x24>282 billion in assets.
In addition, the Center for Economic and Financial Research’s local principal institute released a report on the development of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, according to which there are 103,000 “secondary” millionaires in Russia, whose assets total <0x24>670 billion.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the existential minimum.)
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow — and that’s why we’re all here,” said Nicole Marais, London’s sales and marketing representative, David Morris.
She was at the fair for the first time, together with the Russian distributor of the brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are immaculately adjusted, and men are all for the entire fortune."
While they were spending the evening in the halls on Sunday evenings, twenty-one-year-old Evgenia Yumatov and five-year-old Sv<0xC4><0x9B>tlana Turovková identified themselves and their clients as millionaires.
"I was looking at those cars and I can't decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Mrs. Yumatov, who was dressed in a brand like a veteran of red carpets, next to which Joan Rivers looks like a home runner.
The fair seemed to be focused primarily on fresh rich people, brand-driven Russian buyers, who are willing to sit down for a few hours in road traffic so that they can walk through the warehouse apart, which is screamingly mixing Cadillacy Escalade balls, stools, balloons, platinum pebbles, pebbles.
Members of the public could buy tickets for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 (<0x24>44.57).
"Russians are interested in which brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Gijrath, who patriotically occupied the stand of Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft before reproducing Rembrandt's painting of hand-painted blue tin in surviving size.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in gold."
And indeed, local sellers say that Russians with old money (according to Russian standards are 10 to 15 years old) have already moved from flashing logs to little known brands of limited editions that would never appear at the shopping fair.
Even a few thousand people, whether millionaires, millionaires envoys or simple tourists, flooded the fair halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first day of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the local general manager of the King Koil bed, said he sold two sets of silk mattresses, cashmere and cotton, interwoven with gold threads, for <0x24>70,000.
Also on the first day, Mikhail Lyubimov, sales manager of A1 Moto, which equips high-end cars with high-end alarms, said his company sold a brightly orange Porsche for <0x24>170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrej Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, which manages luxury cars on demand, said he had sold three networks to cars in the style of connected chain bracelets for the Rolls-Royce Phantom for <0x24>55,000.
He showed the reporter the wheel of a car designed for the Russian casino owner, which was to strip the coated Swarovski crystals so that it looked like roulette.
Price: <0x24>22,000 for four of those.
“The Russian millionaire who wants to ride a wheel of pear skin or a portrait of his wife made of cubic zirconia does not have to ride on those wheels yet,” Karapetian said.
"Store them in your garage for thirty to forty cars."
Although many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaire" currently does not mean anything very exclusive, given the large increase in the prices of local properties.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you're probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Those who are not millionaires could at least pretend to be wealthy at the stand operated by the Russian company Alliance Continental, which deals with asset management.
The company has picked up four British-style red phone buddies with <0x24>1 million worth of fake banknotes.
Azad Karriev, the company’s marketing manager, said that his team printed 500,000 fake banknotes for the Millionaires Fair.
The spectators stopped to throw a bunch of money around, or to let friends take pictures on their mobile phone while they were resting in the middle of an alternate wealth, or simply tossed a few million dollars in their pockets.
"You know, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," Karriev said.
Death in New Jersey May Be Caused by Corrupted Surgery
It was the day before Thanksgiving, when Roland Livingston looked from the big windows of the restaurant’s “O’s healthier” restaurant and watched an ambulance arrive at a white New England house two houses down West Scott Avenue.
Soon, the police car joined.
And then another one.
"Then I saw the delivery of the forensic doctor arrived," said Mr. Livingston, restaurant inspector.
"I knew at that moment that someone was dead."
Authorities have found out that the dead woman was Olga Arroya, 41, an executive assistant to the head of the police department in Newark.
Investigators are now trying to determine whether she died from an unlicensed plastic surgeon whose identity police refused to provide, who worked at house number 212 on West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have yet to find out what caused Miss Arroyo's death, and hope that toxicological tests, the results of which may not be known for weeks, will help solve the mysterious death that sent a wave of sadness under the leadership of the Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo has been an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice has been known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, resilient, and worked hard," McCarthy said of Ms. Arroyo in a phone interview on Wednesday.
“It was my shield.
It would protect me."
Mr. McCarthy said that Mrs. Arroy was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former New York police officer working for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that he left behind two sons aged 14 and 11 and his unborn daughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokeswoman for Union District Attorney, Theodora J. Romankova, said the detectives were trying to find out if Miss Arroyo died as a result of unlicensed surgery.
"It's one of the options," said Ms. Walsh.
"Investigation is still underway."
Authorities said they arrived at the house at about three o’clock in the afternoon.
In November, they found Miss Arroyo on the couch.
She was declared dead on the spot.
More than a week later, authorities still said little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, who is allegedly Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh didn't tell me if the authorities had heard Ms. Castro.
Investigators are trying to determine whether part of the house was used as an office.
On Wednesday at Miss Castro's house, with a damaged pink shrub in the front yard and a Dalmatian beating in the back, no one answered.
Next to the door leading to the basement, there was a blue barrel in an open garage with the inscription "Ethyl Vanillin" - which is a substance used as a substitute for vanilla in food and cosmetics.
Two mountain bikes were hanging on one side of the hooks.
Mr. McCarthy recalled that when he first arrived in New York City for 25 years at the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroy provided him with invaluable assistance in proving his new city’s hateful and ruthless political culture.
"She said, 'You should pay attention to this or this,'' he said.
“She was always there when I came, and she was always there when I left.
It was embarrassing."
Hopes that the Fed will lower interest rates lead to stronger global stock exchanges
Share prices on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday jumped after market hopes that the Federal Bank would try to calm borrowing conditions by further lowering interest rates were reinforced by reassuring statements by the vice-president of the U.S. central bank.
The exchanges jumped in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, the second in a row behind Ben Bernanke, the Fed president, said that in response to continued pressure on financial markets, managers must be "flexible and pragmatic".
In an apparent attempt to calm the irritated markets amid hints of reviving credit efforts, Mr. Kohn said that recent excitement "partly reversed some improvements in the functioning of the markets by the end of September and October".
He also said that if the increased volatility persists, the likelihood that the financial conditions of households and businesses will continue to deteriorate will increase.
Investors see these statements as a signal that the Fed is ready to deliver additional fresh shares of capital to the U.S. markets, and perhaps even further lower interest rates to stabilize credit conditions.
These remarks also helped reassure Wall Street amid further bad news about the U.S. economy, as apartment sales hit record lows in October.
The consequences of the financial confidence were underscored by Bear Stearns’ announcement that it will abolish 650 jobs, which is 4% of its global workforce, as part of the cost reductions due to the compensation of heavy losses caused by unintended bets on the supply chain.
Only 20 of these seats are expected to be cancelled in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index grew by 331 points, or 2.55 percent, and closed to 13,289.40, while the more-used S&P 500 index grew by 2.65 percent.
The London FTSE 100 index increased by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, and closed to 6,306.2, with the value of British blue chips rising by more than <0xC2><0xA3>39 billion.
The German Dax index grew by 2.6 percent and the French CAC40 grew by 2.3 percent.
Some time ago, loan tensions in the markets showed full force after these funds were lent to European commercial banks at a rate of 4.7 %, the highest since April 2001, at the auction of the three-monthly monetary packages of the European Central Bank.
Pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and the ECB and release over-standard money to the London monetary markets has increased as the rates of the three-month British interbank loans "Libor" rose after an uninterrupted growth of 6 per cent, down from 12 per cent.
England must decide: Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
We have two dilemmas, one almost as difficult as the other.
Who will be number six on the pitch for England this weekend in Kandy, Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopar?
And, in the wider context of nothing less relevant than the first Test against Sri Lanka, who is going to make this decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the chairman of the selection committee, who holds the best position in the loaned time, has Peter Moores, the head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain's office, with the decision to help, and because the chairman's chairman, Hugh Morrison's chairman, will be in charge.
He who is not placed in sixth place on the pole will be unhappy, but life is often not fair and sport no longer at all.
It is not easy to find what gets one to the top of his profession, while someone else will never get over the lower level, sometimes because of the lack of happiness rather than ability.
Not only in cricket, the choice is demanding and requires a judgment, which in the end must always be subjective.
Is it the right time for Bopara to move up?
Is it fair to Shah, if so?
We could ask the same question in another area, let's say that here: John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both smart young executives with good education and oversight in the field, should be promoted to the committee - the place is just for one.
Who's to say which level is right for cricketers if they can't drop or swim to the next level?
Of course, numbers have a big influence on decision-making, but they also have opportunities.
In the team, the cricketer must capture the captain’s view at the right time if he is to take the wicket, and the striker needs a regular chance at starting positions if he is ever going to make an impression as a one-day cricketer.
Capturing the view of the selector is more complicated.
For example, last season, there were many better players than James Anderson, whose place in the first Test seems certain, even if Stephen Harmison declared himself healthy and excelled as an artillery sniper.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets at 33 runs each.
Chris Tremlett took just 29 at the same low average, but both had their moments at the highest level and hoped for the next.
If he plays at Asgiriya Shah Stadium, or Bopara can be just a matter of opinion.
Choices can expand or affect both careers, or they may not have a big impact.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test and in the first class gave good performances, five wickets and 40 free runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, who at the same time fought for his place, who eventually became a stable stand-up stand, a stand-up stand-up stand, a stand-up stand-up stand-up stand, a stand-up stand-up stand-up cricketer.
It is more likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after another discussion in the wake of today’s training clean at Asirgia Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and prefer Shah’s greater experience to Bopar’s youthful luxuries.
There are arguments for both.
For Shaha, his brilliant and valuable debut Test Exchanges at 88 points in Bombay and 32 hundred in first-class versus six Bopars, who is twenty-seven years younger and has excellent statistics against spins.
However, Shah made only ten runs in two rounds in May against the Caribbean in the Lord's Test, his home playground in Middlesex, and that, along with the immediate rejection of the pickers, when Vaughan tried to take him back to the other side.
On the other hand, the Essex universal has joy of living in the bones.
On the cricket court, nothing leaks him, and his behavior outside the court symbolizes a newly-turned four-wheeled car on the exhibition day of the car sponsor of the English team, Volkswagen.
He got out with slight injuries and apparently shock, but the first thing he pulled out his Vodafone (of course also sponsored) and called Alastair Cook, his long-awaited companion, to ask him excitedly, "Did you see that?"
Bopara is definitely better in the field, its medium-fast loop caps on the playgrounds that seem to suit him, effectively distribute and lights up confidently and skillfully.
Choosing the right person is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Perhaps this is the real art of choice.
Personally, I’m inclined to get Bopara his chance right now, which is not to say that Shah won’t excel if, as the Ceylon tea leaves suggest, it’s him who’s going to play next weekend.
Buses Bring Refugees Back to Work - and Fight Al-Qaeda
The first buses full of Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday to wipe out refugees who had received money or expired their visas, and others who hoped the city would return to normal life.
Some even returned to fight with the armed men who drove them out of their homes.
The Mansour bus station was already before 800 people arrived from Damascus in the official government convoy of a dozen buses, full of refugees from Syria and Jordan, who returned by private transport.
“I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad,” said Sabah al-Kubaishi, a Sunni doctor.
“Today I came back because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers, because of what was happening in Baghdad and how safe it is now.
“They say that Mahdi’s army has stopped killing people,” he said, referring to the Shiite militia of militant spiritual Muktad al-Sadra, who temporarily ordered his people to stop fighting.
Kasim al-Atwani, an eighty-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni region of Amarija, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew the Syrian visa and because the regime there did not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amarija called on him with a local home defense, with the support of the U.S. military, to help push al-Qaeda out of its positions in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan is the leader of the Sunni and Shiite tribes, whom he expelled from his home in Sleikh in northern Baghdad after he urged his fellow citizens to rebel against al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
“Yesterday, a few friends called me and told me that they were going to be militia in Sleikh against al-Qaeda and that they needed me and the support of my boys.
That’s why I came back today,” said 25-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many spoke of the attraction of calm in the capital after the strengthening of the U.S. military presence and the growth of local "groups of engaged citizens" who defend their neighborhood with weapons in hand alongside the U.S. military.
But more was said that the return was caused by obstructions around visas and loss of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarraj, the father of three children, said in a loud voice of suspicion among the refugees that Núri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, had asked the Syrian government to lift restrictions on the refugees' visas and thus force them to return.
According to available data, more than two and a half million people have fled Iraqi sectarian assassins.
“Everything was fine before al-Maliki visited Syria and pressured the government to stop giving Iraqis a visa to have to return to Iraq,” he said.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house after I left."
A common reason for the weakening of violence is the fact that the Sunnis were expelled from Shi’ite areas and vice versa, which in many places reduces tensions.
There are fears that the sudden influx of refugees will again exacerbate sectarian tensions and lead to further fighting.
Small Saarland, good education
Germany’s smallest state plays a leading role in vocational education, excelling even with the international focus of its universities.
In just one area of education, Saarland is concerned about the same deficiency as the rest of Germany.
"To a man who is not from Saarland, I explained yesterday for the fiftieth year that we are not French" - this self-sacrificing slogan appears on posters in Saarland on the occasion of the 50th birthday of this smallest federal country.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the SAR education system, which is in monitoring the education of the Cologne Institute of Economic Research (IW) in fifth place.
Colleges have traditionally cooperated closely with the surrounding countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded by the French in 1948.
Today, students can complete their studies with a double or even a triple degree.
This corresponds to a fairly high proportion of foreign students, which is 15.6%.
After all, the above-average number of Sharia children are accepted to college – many of them without high school.
“In Saarland, a professional education system is being used,” says Axel Plünnecke, IW’s education expert.
By obtaining more than one in five young people authorised to study at a vocational school, Saarland is more than 7% above the German average.
Compared to the rest of Germany, Saarland has many options for combining practical and academic education.
Opportunities to study two disciplines are the second best in Germany in terms of population.
Despite practically oriented education and rising demand, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by one-third in recent years.
That is why the Saar Ministry of Education has now ordered the universities to create a promotional campaign for the engineering fields.
"After the first study of Pisa, we have carried out several reforms in general education schools," a spokesman for the Ministry of Education said.
Therefore, the government has introduced comparative tests throughout Germany.
In order for children to start learning as early as possible, the last year of parental school is free - a model that is also taken over by other federal countries.
If the student’s results improve significantly, they will only be shown by a future comparative study.
In the 2003 Pisa study, the share of risk pupils decreased from 29 to 20%.
Overall, however, Sardinia has not improved as much as any other federal country.
The Bavarians can count better.
And disappointingly, Pisa’s studies do not compare knowledge of foreign languages – otherwise, Sardinia could be in this area.
The language of the neighbors is compulsory at the gymnasiums – even if the inhabitants of Sardinia are not French.
Chávez moves clocks
What can't be seen will go clockwise in Venezuela other than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez will have his clock shifted in this South American country by half an hour.
In the meantime, in Spain, Chávez is becoming a funny figure.
The official Venezuelan newspaper reported that the clocks would be shifted by less than four and a half hours, according to the new law.
The South American state will be this step in the time zone, which does not exist in any other country in the world.
Chávez, the enemy of the United States, justified his decision, among other things, by imposing the United States on the world the division of time zones over the course of hours.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday that he was breaking relations with neighboring Colombia because of the case with the hostages.
The left-wing nationalist has stated that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe is the president of Colombia, he will not maintain any relations with him or with the Colombian government.
“I can’t do it anymore because of my self-esteem,” said Chávez, who is advocating a constitutional reform that the citizens of this oil country must vote on in a referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, Chávez would significantly strengthen his power in the country.
The controversy sparked Uribe’s decision to remove Chávez’s mandate to negotiate in Colombia with Marxist rebels about the release of hostages.
Uribe, with his decision Venezuela "put in the face", criticised Uribe Chávez on Sunday.
In Spain, too, everyone is talking about Chávez.
A new mobile call here triggered a stir: "Por qué no te llamas" - that's the phrase that more than half a million people have downloaded from the internet.
It was pronounced by Spanish King Juan Carlos, who at the recent Ibero-American summit was so enraged by the voiceful remarks of this leftist populist that he silenced him in this way.
Germans are at risk of lower pay in 2007
According to the forecast, German employees are facing a real wage cut this year despite a strong economic downturn.
Experts have reasoned their pessimistic prognosis for a number of reasons.
The Hans Böckler Foundation estimates that in 2007, employees can actually expect to receive a lower salary than last year.
“The blame is on small increases in wages, increases in value-added tax, and increases in food and energy prices,” Gustav Horn, of the Institute for Macroökonomie und Konjunkturforschung, told the Bild newspaper.
New burdens on employees may also be waiting for in the area of unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung that the planned reduction in unemployment insurance contributions to 3.3% for the new year is right and reasonable in this situation.
However, the Federal Labour Agency should no longer fall into such hardships that it would have to demand loans or contributions from the federal youth, the newspapers quoted as saying.
On Tuesday, it was announced that the price explosion of food and petroleum products pushed inflation to its highest level in the last 13 years.
In the year-on-year comparison, prices increased by 3% overall.
Venus is the Earth's hell twins
In spite of its hostile atmosphere, Venus Earth is more similar than previously thought. The European space probe Venus Express on Venus has recorded phenomena that appear on Earth in the winter as well: lightning in the atmosphere and winds on the poles.
For almost three decades, scientists have been imagining that Venus is flickering.
Now the European Venus Express probe has brought evidence - it has captured electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus, lightnings fly from cloud to cloud at an altitude of about 56 kilometers, wrote in the science journal Nature Christopher Russell of the University of California, Los Angeles.
According to a well-known theory, the formation of the original matter could have caused life on Earth by lightning. Storms allegedly triggered reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the basic stones of life.
“If life ever existed on Venus, it must have been a long time ago,” explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
Today, the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than the Earth, and sometimes temperatures are around 500 <0xC2><0xB0>C.
"There may be hell twins on Earth, but there are twins," Russel said.
Why Venus, which is the Earth's mass and size so similar, began to evolve completely differently, is a fundamental question of the mission of Esa.
Since no probe has been sent exclusively for the purpose of studying Venus since the early 1990s, the launch of the Venus Express in November 2005 was a milestone in the exploration of the planet.
According to scientists, the latest research findings, which brought together several articles in the journal Nature, did not only emphasize the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
“They also showed that our neighboring planet is more Earth-like than previously thought,” Esa said.
In addition to the already known winds on the north pole, scientists have found a cloudy winds on the south pole, which rotates considerably faster.
This phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents in the Earth's northern hemisphere, writes a research team led by Guiseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Astrophysics Spatiale and Physics Cosmica.
The second innermost planet of our solar system is made up of almost the same mass as Earth, and with a diameter of 12,100 km is also almost the same size.
This planet, known as the Morning Star or Evening Star, orbits the Sun in no less than 225 days.
However, it rotates around its own axis much more slowly, with a day on Venus lasting 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus does not resemble the surface temperature of 460 <0xC2><0xB0>C and the pressure of 92 bars of Earth, scientists believe that both planets were formed under very similar conditions.
The water accumulated on both of them, but on Earth it remained in the oceans, while from Venus it evaporated into space.
While carbon dioxide is bonded in carbonates on Earth, on Venus it forms most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel’s meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler calls for the end of party disputes over the acceptance of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellor’s office.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for its attacks on the chancellor after the September meeting.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany’s reputation and calls for a major coalition to end the fight to embrace the Dalai Lama.
“We should not present ourselves externally as a nation that is not unified on this issue,” Köhler told the Wirtschaftsblatt newspaper.
At the same time, he expressed his understanding of the decision of German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to adopt the Dalai Lama in September.
“Although I respect cultural differences, human rights are universal to me,” Köhler said.
While the Federal President stressed that everyone knows that Germany must maintain a reasonable balance in foreign policy, it did not prevent Merkel from stopping when she was charged with creating a new policy towards China.
“The Chancellor did not abandon the traditional policy of a unified China.
China knows that too,” Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) has indirectly expressed his disagreement with the acceptance of the Dalai Lama, and has been attacked by the coalition.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, about the coalition’s “preview” foreign policy.
After the adoption of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellor’s office, German-Chinese relations deteriorated.
Not only did the Chinese government cancel the invitation of German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to SPIEGEL magazine, it also froze the so-called strategic dialogue of foreign ministries between the two countries.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge that the acceptance of the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China disapproves when European politicians officially accept a Tibetan spiritual leader, Wen Jiabao stressed China’s position.
The words and actions of the Dalai Lama have shown that Tibet, along with other Tibetan regions also located in China, is trying to separate from China.
Schäuble warns of similar unrest that has erupted in France
Street battles with police, shootings, fired cars. Wolfgang Schäuble warns of similar unrest that erupted in France.
We must do everything we can to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not escalate into street violence, the Federal Minister of the Interior said.
Barricades burned, rioters shot at the police. After serious youth riots in France, Federal Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears similar developments in Germany.
“We must be careful not to create social tensions that will explode in violence.
We have to take it seriously," he said in the Hanover newspaper Neue Presse.
It is said that not every young person is able to cope with the rapid change in social reality.
The federal government, the country and the municipality are already working hard to solve the problems, Schäuble said.
This is not just about the integration of migrants.
"From the integration summit after the conference on Islam, we are recording the first successes."
However, caution is still in place.
At the same time, Schäuble pointed out that the planning and sociological problems of German suburbs are not comparable to those of France.
In the past nights, youths and police in the northern suburbs of Paris have engaged in fierce street fighting.
In Toulouse, cars and public buildings were burned.
More integration efforts by the German government were demanded by the Turkish municipality’s president, Kenan Kolat.
Taking into account the unrest in France, Kolat warned of a "image effect".
The situation in Germany should not be as explosive as in France.
Nevertheless, action should be taken.
Kolat pointed out that among people under the age of 25 who come from migrant families, the unemployment rate is "over-average".
In particular, it is necessary to provide a greater number of study opportunities.
Kolat stressed: “We must give youthful hope.”
The president of the Turkish municipality added, however, that in Germany, unlike France, there is greater social control over families.
In addition, many youths from migrant families do not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat urged, "Too often, but we have to be careful."
We need to allow young people "quickly to start working and educating themselves."
In the meantime, the night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel was mostly quiet.
Hundreds of police officers were deployed and a helicopter with lights flew over the area.
Authorities have reported three arrests and several incinerated trash cans and cars.
Since yesterday, about 1,000 deployed law enforcement forces have taken care of the peace.
Police will intervene as long as necessary, Michelle Alliot-Marie said after a visit to the suburb of the country’s interior minister.
Around 80 policemen were injured in riots in the suburbs of Villiers-le-Bel on Tuesday night.
The next night, the riots in Toulouse were overwhelming.
The incident was caused by a Sunday traffic accident in which two young people lost their lives.
According to the initial findings of the state prosecutor’s office, the police are not responsible for the deaths of juveniles.
Angela's "Windows" Empire
The chancellor’s far-fetched statement shows that the coalition is at the end of the program and that we can’t expect anything more from it either.
In what country does the Chancellor actually live?
After her relentless, indifferent and content-poor speech at the General Debate of the Federal Parliament, we must observe: not here - not in this country that she should ultimately manage.
On the premise that she is too focused on foreign policy, Angela Merkel once replied with a very arrogant sentence.
It’s provincial, she said, showing that she doesn’t want to understand what the critics are about.
In the House of Commons, she clearly showed everyone how much she deserved this clearance.
There was no real interest in Merkel, but a feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela "Oblaková" was presented: a politician who stands out over others, who runs into foreign policy and even there she expresses herself only blurredly.
For example, climate protection: he is constantly praising the conclusions of the Heiligendamm summit, but no longer says how the climate targets are to be achieved in Germany.
And in any case, such a praise – so much dishonesty would forgive the president of the CDU even two years ago.
Now it is limited to flat phrases that could increase her popularity among people.
With this approach, it damages its image of a pragmatic who does not need to lick, because it solves problems.
But in the Angela "Windows" empire, internal political problems are marginal issues.
Children's poverty and the worries of low-wage people?
There are a few other comments on these topics left to her.
It’s worth noting how often Merkel overlooks when it comes to children’s allowances.
Merkel has to start from the beginning three times before she can say at least partly the right sentence.
As soon as things begin to become very specific, they plunge like in a completely foreign terrain.
Attack Department
The debate of Republican presidential candidates on Youtube sparked a fierce debate over the favourites of Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney – and both now have to worry about an outsider candidate.
The tensions between the two candidates are already reflected in the first issue.
Mitt Romney reports to his rival Rudy Guiliani that he has made New York a “refugee for illegal immigrants.”
Giuliani reacts quickly with sharp whispers: "I think his own house was just one such refuge," he responds and suggests to the former governor of Massachusetts that he privately employed immigrant people without documents.
As the Republican base does not yet have a clear favorite, eight presidential candidates are using these debates on CNN primarily to discredit their rivals.
Half-minutes of videos recorded by internet users and sent via Youtube serve only as such key topic help.
“It is precisely this policy of isolationism that we have allowed Hitler to take power,” John McCain told his rival Ron Paul, who is the only one who promotes the immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
Vietnamese veteran McCain has not spared Romney or his bribery for refusing to condemn a tortured interrogation method called "Waterboarding", which simulates warming.
Public reactions in St. Petersburg, Florida, show that neither the war in Iraq nor the method of torture are among the important themes of the campaign.
The emphasis is sparked whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected.
Then it will show where the weaknesses of both favorites lie.
"I was wrong at the time," explains Romney, confused, and asks the party base and the television audience for forgiveness for his endorsement of abortions in 1994.
Giuliani is in despair when he is to express himself to the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf to rule in civilian territory for the first time
The day after his resignation from the position of commander-in-chief of the army, the Pakistani ruler Musharraf made a presidential oath.
This is the end of eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan’s President Parvíz Musharraf has sworn in a presidential oath on Thursday and will remain in office for another five years.
Pakistani television broadcast live at a ceremony held at the presidential palace in the capital, Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the constitution and strive for the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, his office as the commander-in-chief of the army handed over to his secretary, Ashfaq Kiyani, which put himself under international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after taking power in a bloodless military coup, a former general reigns for the first time as the civilian head of state.
With his resignation from the position of commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf met one of the main demands of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the cancellation of the state of emergency, which Musharraf declared on 3 November.
According to U.S. Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyuma, Musharraf will cancel the state of emergency soon after his oath, thereby fulfilling another of the West’s demands.
The country’s highest court, which Musharraf held after the declaration of the state of emergency at the beginning of November by lawyers in favour of him, rejected all objections to the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6.
In the meantime, five soldiers were killed and four others were injured in the attack on a military convoy in the tribal area of North Vaziristan.
An army spokesman said the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
My father's cockroach is back.
The famous German band of the '70s is playing again. Three members of Harmonia have picked up their electronic synthesizers again at a concert in Berlin.
Revival will also include Live 1974, a cut from the band's most successful period.
At the time, they were much more famous abroad.
The stated sensation then lies in the performance of three sitting gentlemen, who at first seem to be just enjoying dinner.
Everyone has a box in front of them, cables and, above all, buttons.
Thirty-three-year-old Dieter Moebius sits in a snow-white shirt in the middle.
On his left is seventy-year-old Michael Rother, who has a laptop and a guitar in front of him.
Thirty-seven-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius, who focuses on synthesizers, is on the right from the viewer’s perspective.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even beats.
Sometimes, by no means, a traditional song will arise.
It doesn’t seem to bother the musicians too much.
The revival of the band Harmonia provoked considerable agitation among the lovers of crautrock.
One thing is worth noting here. Repeated questions have shown that although this name is part of the collective consciousness of the pop, it is certainly not enough to make this band missing for twenty-three years painfully.
But why couldn’t a German celebrate his still-living legends of the 1970s?
And especially when you value a musical style, mistakenly called krautrock, in England and America more than in your own country.
When the music business awarded the remaining members of the Cologne group Can the Echo Award for life work in 2003, the hall was filled with questioning views of German pop fans.
In addition, when the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! for their speech, the spectators no longer knew the limits.
Michael Rother later sat on stage with them at the Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts as their old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and worship abroad is one thing.
Remembering the band Harmonia, we overburden the memory in vain, this trio existed only for two years, and there was no such influence at that time as others later attributed to it.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
Initially, they played in the basement of the Berlin Theater Schaubühne.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons at a gramophone company led by the church.
Rother briefly helped with the Kraftwerk group, but gained a reputation as a guitarist with Neu!, which was perhaps the most radical German group at the time.
In 1973, Rother followed musicians from Cluster to exile in Forst, Westerbergland.
There, in Old Weserhof, the ruins of the 16th century, lived as members of the communes who fled the city.
They did not live here as ideologically as in Commune I, where Roedelius was still allowed to steal as a nurse.
It was rather a life in such a spitzweg artistic being.
The name for the art is allegedly derived from the name of the song choir Harmonia Ottenstein, whose badge was allegedly found in the ash.
A lot of that has been maintained by Harmony.
The first album was called "Music by Harmony" and the next "De Luxe".
Although their music sounded so calm and modest, the band suffered financial difficulties.
Gathering roasts was not just self-recognition.
The now-released CD "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert in Griessum before a record-breaking small, barely fifty-member stage.
At that time, Rothera expressed a wish that the members of Harmony would be ejected and exercised occasionally.
For Roedlia and Moebi, that was a totally unpleasant request.
In 1975, the band announced their breakup.
Rother ended up in the esoteric sphere and secured his future with the album "The Burning Heart".
The Cluster band revived in the 1980s and has been more successful since then than Harmonia has ever been.
We can thank Herbert Grönemeyer for the live album from Griessemer.
His recording company Greenland aimed to take care of krautrock as the original German contribution to live music.
The band Neu! was considered to be Roedeli's solo work at the time.
The physical resurrection of Harmony will take place in the Berlin House of World Cultures.
The performance at the Woldtronics festival will be publicly sponsored.
There will be Brit, Julian Cope, an old jumper and the author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
The founder of Love Parade, Dr. Motte, is also involved.
That's how we've drawn the overall width of the influence of the cartoon on future pop music.
The empty seat of the famous group will fill the Harmony.
The story of Brian Ena, accompanied by the most amazing sounds, is told in the room: "The unique true music, it belongs to the future."
There are pictures on which the producer is with Harmonia in the farmhouse.
To create the legend is also contributed by the broadcasting of other black and white photos, on which the set of instruments are wildly connected cables.
Previously, the three veterans were again employed by improvisation.
No more gluing the microphones on bars and drums to evaporate the never-before-heard self-made tones from the instruments.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three in the technique of punching punches.
This does not change the House of World Cultures.
Under the leadership of Barbara Morgenstern, she whispers under the sound clouds and in one beautiful place she emphatically sings "Aaaaaaaaa!"
Krautrock has always been a very English term.
It was never about rock.
We would find roots rather than in blues at music colleges (Can), in technology (Kraftwerk) or in escape from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
The one who shouts "'68!" in this place is not so far from the truth, but even now the Harmony will not be left out of peace.
Even the most obvious thing is carefully thought out on the stage.
Where does music start and when does it end?
This question will either prepare a person for the nerves or allow him to experience passing moments of happiness.
Richard Gere is not cynical enough.
With the release of The Hunting Party and Mörderischer Frieden, two films about the war in the Balkans appeared immediately.
But none of them are convincing.
The presentation of the films either puts too much emphasis on action and shooting, or they are too impressive.
The Hunting Party is not going to stop an actor like Richard Gere.
The good news is that Karadzi<0xC4><0x87> and Mladi<0xC4><0x87> are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, but that’s where, in the cloudy background of the Bosnian War, actor Richard Gere arrives.
Recently, we have lost this most beautiful man of the 1980s out of sight, not only because he played many adorable, insignificant roles in comfy women's films, but in conjunction with his press conferences forever on the topic of Buddhism, man will take a taste of the next movie with that.
And yet, Richard Gere is suddenly the strongest argument for watching The Hunting Party - Where the Hunter Becomes a Curse (Why must the names of the films be so long and confused these days?).
Its war reporter Simon Hunt is essentially who Gere could become if fate and the film industry weren't so gracious: a man who's had his best years in the past, but as a little-like monument, he still keeps it.
But despite this trump, The Hunting Party, along with the German film Mörderischer Frieden, which also goes into theaters this week, is just a continuation of an endless series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
With the film Mörderischer Frieden we can make a short process: This film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who save a Serbian girl from a Kosovo shooter, and one of them falls in love with her.
Although it is commendable that the Serbs are not presented here as the cause of all evil, this tv movie turns too early into shooting and action.
There will be something very similar to the series of the 11th of November, without a motorway, but for the war.
In The Hunting Party, we can explore why a really good film about the Balkan War has not yet been made.
The story of three American war reporters who pretend to be a “little” Serbian top war criminal could possibly become a new “Apocalypse” at another time and under the leadership of another director and screenwriter (both Richard Shepard).
After all, both stories are surprisingly similar: small groups go to the forest to do something that the army is not capable of, but their journey becomes a path to madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of The Hunting Party is that Simon Hunt is not the disgusting and sentimental cynic presented at the outset.
On the contrary, the proposal also prescribes a romantic affair with a later murdered Bosnian Muslim woman.
The Hunting Party can be rewritten with final validity after the reporters in the last five accelerated minutes of the film are told what NATO, the CIA and all the criminal hunters of the world have failed in the last five years: to catch criminals and leave them to be punished.
This is so contrary to the logic of filmmaking that it would be worth turning to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
This film has a profound human message.
It condemns that Karadzic and Mladi<0xC4><0x87> are still free, and suspects that Americans and French (here they are exceptionally united) do not commit persecution enough on the basis of secret political agreements.
But good and evil are sometimes so similar that women attack us with the famous Brecht poem.
It is about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the writing desk of the writer: "I look compassionately at the swollen veins on the forehead, noting: how strenuous it is to be evil."
In movies like The Hunting Party, there are exactly those swollen heads that show how hard it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the issue of war in the Balkans.
Recently, it was written in these newspapers that all the Hollywood films about Iraq were big failures.
To add to this one thing: No good movie about South Africa has ever been made.
Almost always applies: When a star slips through a crisis zone or passes through a minefield, a film like Rangoon with Patricia Arquette, Borders of Breaking with Angelina Jolie or Blood Diamond with Leonard DiCaprio is created.
Maybe all those conflicts are just too close to the time.
After all, it must have been decades before Hollywood could make a good film about the Holocaust - Schindler's List.
Many films must apparently mature - films that are now considered classic Vietnamese works - "The Hunter of the Elves", "Apocalypse" or "The Hunted Vest" - were not in any way celebrated as masterpieces at the time.
But perhaps today, when every mass murder at home appears on two screens, we know too much about the conflicts of this world.
Writers then do not have the ability needed to make good stories flawlessly.
"To be or not to be" or "The Great Dictator" became so good, after all, because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how terriblely the Nazi regime actually ruled.
Maybe you don’t want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Perhaps he must form a sarcasticly measured artistic view as novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
Asked on a parallel between his historical novel "Lemprier's Dictionary" and "The Balkan War", he stated: "The image is only that some things never change.
Cities will always be very dangerous, people will always be killed in a terrible way, and there will always be war in Yugoslavia.”
Von Beust to Blame Criticism for Denying Olympics
The Mayor’s resignation from holding the Summer Olympics in Hamburg has faced sharp criticism of politics and the economy.
Many want to continue to fight for the organization of the water games.
Von Beust, however, calls for realism in the estimation of chances.
The chief executive of the Chamber of Commerce in Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, called the decision "unhappy from the point of view of the business".
No other project in recent years has aroused as much motivation in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this goal, it would not be possible to keep this sporting political enthusiasm to such a high degree."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to create for it a new long-term concept, "based on a changed schedule."
Mayor Ole von Beust stayed on Wednesday with his earlier statements that Hamburg’s Olympic ambitions are at least unrealistic by 2028.
"Not Hamburg, but the German Olympic Sports Association will decide on the Olympic nomination," von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
He pointed out that at the beginning of December the Sports Union will decide on Munich’s nomination for the 2018 Winter Games.
“This preference for us means that with the 2028 schedule, we have no realistic chance.”
Yet this dream has not yet ended, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Association (HSB) has called Von Beust’s statements regrettable.
It seems that Hamburg does not want to attend the Olympic Games in the next twenty-five years.
"It is too soon to destroy our chances by declaring the plans already in this early stage as buried," HSB President Günter Ploss said on Wednesday.
The resignation would be contrary to the statement made by the head of the Senate at the General Assembly of the General German Higher Sports Union.
Von Beust did not announce Hamburg's candidacy for the University in 2015 as a substitute for the Olympic Games.
Hamburg's high school sports union has only been nominated for a candidate city last week.
The SPD faction in the Hamburg Senate said it was wasting valuable time that could be used to build apartments in Hamburg.
"The development of the Klein Grasbrook area has been suspended by the Senate for years because it has been betting on the Olympics and excluding the construction of apartments," SPD MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast said.
While the SPD for the Klein Grasbrook area still planned the Olympics with the entire area being later used for residential purposes, the CDU unanimously opted for an "Olympic factor".
The admission to the 2012 Summer Olympics has been a source of great enthusiasm for its time in Hamburg.
Hamburg was lost in Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's boxes.
The person who combines the expressions of Sweden and the wooden boxes doesn’t mean Andy Warhol, but Ike.
Or is it?
Wooden boxes currently manufactured in Sweden are putting on Warhol’s Dark Shadows list.
Most of the ninety-four "Brillo boxes" of the Stockholm type are counterfeit.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" have been skeptical of the authenticity of the Warhol "Brillo boxes" of 1968, the internal research of the Moderna Museet Museum in Stockholm comes with the result that brought the disappointment to the "Stocknock", the six "Brillo boxes, the brooms of 1995" in his Modern rocket.
Previous events are an envelope, melting chain of artistic and curatorial events.
Warhol made his first Brillo boxes in New York City in 1964, softening wooden boxes that were based on the red-and-white design of Brillo soap powder paper boxes.
The exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet in 1968 presented - with Warhol's consent - hundreds of Brillo cartons. These were not (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo factory.
It was not about artworks, but about their templates, just exhibition pieces.
Warhol apparently also gave permission in 1968 to make several wooden Brillo bodies in Sweden, but those not exhibited in Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of that time are now talking about fifteen boxes, which at that time rightly entered art and auction history as authorised originals - "Andy Warholvy Brillo Box" labeled Type Stockholm.
Some of them were auctioned for more than <0x24>100,000.
The problem now lies in the fact that the legendary director of the museum, Pontus Hulten, later falsely claimed that in 1968, about a hundred bodies were produced and exhibited in Sweden, which Warhol left to him.
In fact, 105 Hulten bodies were produced in Malmö for the exhibition in St. Petersburg only in 1990.
At that time Warhol was already three years after his death.
Lars Byström, the top conservator of Moderna Museet, explored in addition to the six Brillo boxes owned by the museum, as well as three Brillo boxes from a Swedish private collection, two of which were made in Sweden in 1968 by a battered battered base and barbed with barbed wire.
From the structure of the 1990 copies, on the other hand, it was revealed that the paint was applied directly to the adhesive board without the previous basic coating - in addition, it is acrylic and not oil paint.
"These boxes weren't authorised by the artist and should be removed from Warhol's official Brillo box paper," Moderna Museet director Lars Nittve said: "If the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board doesn't come up with an "artist's record" in New York, it's going to have to be a bunch of other conclusions.
In July, the Authentication Board announced that it would deal with these "additional charges" that have been raised in the case of soap boxes.
However, the organization still remains in constant silence.
Insurgents in Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers resigned, who were fortified at a hotel in Manila and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Insurgent commander Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of manipulation and corruption in the election, told reporters at the hotel that he refused responsibility for the bloodshed.
Soldiers loyal to the government earlier attacked with tear gas deployed to the hotel.
A few hours earlier, about two dozen soldiers were stationed in the building.
On Thursday, about half of them stood in court for a shattered coup attempt in 2003, including Trillones.
He used the talks to get away with his about 30 sympathizers.
The military police officers who were supposed to guard him apparently ran to his side and joined the rebellion.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The government's loyal units closed the area around the selected hotel.
The president called for an emergency meeting of the security cabinet.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
"People are tired of it," Triallnes said.
"We call on the people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, the commander of the former elite unit of the Scout Rangers, said other military units would join the march in a short time.
Critics of the government called for a major demonstration against the president on Friday.
For months, she has been charged with corruption.
In 2003, the Manila financial district became the main hub of the uprising of some 200 soldiers against Arroy.
Because the rebels refused to join the army, the rebellion was lost after less than 24 hours.
Since 1986, the Philippines has tried to overthrow a democratically elected government at least seven times.
United Internet Becomes Majority Shareholder of Versatile
United Internet has secured more than 20 percent stake in the telecommunications company Versatel.
The company announced on Wednesday that the average price per share is 14.46 euros.
The company now owns 20.05% of its equity capital.
Previously, it was speculated about the acquisition.
The company still expects to further increase its stake in Versatile.
United Internet has announced that it is trying to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market.
After Berenberg increased its share of the Düsseldorf network operator by an additional 5 % to 15,1 %, an entry agreement was reached on Wednesday.
In the financial market, it is said that this monetary institution holds shares only for third parties.
Yesterday, United Internet had a nearly 10% stake in Drillish, the provider of mobile telecommunications networks.
As part of the capital increase, Drillish sold another 17.4 million new shares worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>106.4 million.
Of these, 5.15 million shares were purchased by United Internet for 31.4 million euros.
The companies discussed marketing co-operations in the field of DSL products and mobile networks.
“We are strengthening our partnership,” a United Internet spokesman said.
In order to take over the competitor Freenet, the companies together set up a joint venture for SMEs.
United Internet said on Thursday that the two companies are currently satisfied with a share of more than 10% in Freenet and will not exercise their right to take over an additional 18.49% of the company.
It is assumed that companies remain open to all options so far, in particular the possibility to further increase their share in Freenet AG.
The talks between United Internet and Freenet on the strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This months-long, hard-to-transparent game about Freenet is part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million contracted mobile network customers and 1.27 million customers with a complete or DSL connection.
Holding United Internet and Drillische had a 6.01% stake so far in Freenet.
Now it has been agreed that Drillish will get an additional 4%.
The right to purchase 18.49% of the investment company Vatas was agreed in August.
