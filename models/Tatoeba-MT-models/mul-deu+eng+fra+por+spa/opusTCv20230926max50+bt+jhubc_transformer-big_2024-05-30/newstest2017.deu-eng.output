28-Year-Old Cook Found Dead in San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old cook who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in a staircase in a local shopping mall.
The victim's brother said that he can't imagine anyone who would want to hurt him, "Finally he went up again."
The body found on Wednesday morning at Westfield Mall was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, the forensic department in San Francisco said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was classified as a murder and the investigations are ongoing.
The victim’s brother, Louis Galicia, told ABS KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a chef in Boston, had earned his dream job six months ago as a chef at Sons & Daughters’ restaurant in San Francisco.
A spokesman for the Son & Daughter said they were "shocked and destroyed on the ground" over his death.
“We’re a small team that works like a close family and we’re going to miss him painfully,” the spokesman continued.
Our thoughts and our compassion are with Frank’s family and friends in this difficult time.
Louis Galicia admitted that Frank initially lived in hostels, but that, "things finally went up for him."
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," said Louis Garcia KGO.
Louis Galicia said he couldn’t imagine anyone wanting to hurt his younger brother.
He was a friendly man with a big heart.
His way of connecting with his family was always cooking something for us, preparing us for dinner,” said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to take part in any kind of confrontation.
He was the brother who swam with the electricity.
"With everything that goes wrong in the world, he was this uncut diamond that lit brightly every day," he said.
Anyone who has information on the case will be asked to call the SFPD’s phone number 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I'm always stuck in drawers
Jennifer Aniston doesn’t always have to be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood star has made this clear in an interview.
“I’m always stuck in drawers or getting glued to external labels that usually have little to do with me and reality.”
“I myself don’t have the desire to always be perfect and successful.”
"Honestly, I think these things are pretty cool."
Jennifer Aniston, 47, can only laugh about her being considered "Miss Perfect", as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan".
The actress prefers to spend her time at home, in front of a TV with loose dutt and Mexican food, it says in the magazine.
To sum up, she raises the question of the child’s desire: “We women don’t have to be married or have children to be perfect.”
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love is not a children's play", Aniston is seen as a single-parent mother of two sons.
The film will run with us on August 25.
Golfer Langer gets the sport pyramid
His experiences on the horse are overwhelming.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues were looking for a bit of a variation with a walk on the beach.
For the 58-year-old, it was a premiere.
CHIO: "Golden Sport Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses remembered their celebration evening, they hunted home to the feeders in the fast galop.
A mile at that pace, I was scared.
"It wasn't a good experience," Langer says.
And then the riding career ends again.
On Saturday, Germany’s best golfer of all time – 101 tournament wins – was again close to horses.
He and his family were guided by the ALRV facility, and he did not even have to take pictures on a horse.
Longer was the first time in Aachen and thus also at CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German sports aid handed the Golden Sport Pyramid to the man from Anhausen as part of a small gala.
There is no shortage of awards for the sympathetic athlete.
Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...
Even the British queen has already crowned him.
Langer is the 18th winner of the Sports Pyramid.
In Aachen, he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it will be awarded not only for sporting success, but also for social engagement."
Langer has been promoting growth for decades.
And so he passed on the prize money of 25,000 euros equally.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US Masters winner was admitted to the “Hall of Fame of German Sports” on Saturday.
The awards include the lightweight athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the wrestler Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, the Bob-Fahrer Meinhard Nimmer, the Judoka Frank Alberhard der Springeckewin, the Wienerke.
Many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious company migrated to the Spring Stadium, where the Lavazza Prize ran.
Bernhard Langer kept distance from the big animals.
Clinton and Trump's economic policy in comparison: It's all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade deal – that is what both Clinton and Trump want.
However, the two U.S. presidential candidates are unanimous in tax and energy policy as well as in a matter of principle.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep those in doubt small and warns of how the state can harm the economy – with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.
He himself would be completely different, Trump says.
He will massively reverse regulations, and he is striving for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for businesses.
Clinton, on the other hand, says: The state has certain tasks to perform, it has disadvantaged opportunities to open up and needs money for it.
That is why taxes on the rich would be increased, she says.
Interestingly, they are both very close to infrastructure.
Investing in the musts, Trump and Clinton say almost equally.
The Democratic candidate has announced the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.
State investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical tea party wing of the Republicans.
There could be some internal discussions on Trump.
The differences in energy and climate policy are more pronounced.
Trump wants to build coal power plants and boost coal supply in the United States.
Oil promotion should also be possible in protected areas so far, he wants to announce the Paris climate agreement.
Clinton, on the other hand, expressly wants to expand renewable energies with her investment program, calling for “a country to become the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs.”
"It's probably going to be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be."
But not only in terms of infrastructure - even in terms of international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far away from each other.
TPP, the Trans-Pacific Trade Agreement, does not want to sign.
At the same time, however, the United States does not want to isolate itself from international trade – it just wants to better protect American jobs.
They should also be paid better, Clinton said.
The current minimum wage of <0x24>7.25 is a hunger wage.
He wants to raise it to <0x24>15 an hour.
What Trump wants to do on this issue is not quite clear: once he says the minimum wage must rise, then he says that he must not be changed.
But the big discussion over the coming months is likely to evolve around the tax policy of the two camps.
On the one hand, Trump is trying to discourage the economy and citizens to boost growth.
His critics hold him, so that the budget deficit would only be even greater.
On the other hand, Clinton, who at least wants to demand from the rich that they pay more taxes, and their critics say: More taxes are not the solution either.
Escape: "Every woman who has fled has experiences of sexual violence"
Sexual violence is common to women who run away on their own, almost every day.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
There are four women in a large kitchen.
Everyone has a baby that is at least one year old.
One of them put his little son in his arms.
He looks curiously into the room with big eyes.
His mother stared at the table.
Until she realizes she's being watched.
She smiles briefly and kisses the little one.
The scene seems normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is the Managing Director of Condrobs, a social aid provider in Bavaria, and deals, among other things, with the issue of women on the run.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the northern part of Munich in one of the few decentralized accommodations for single women and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs set up the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women’s Aid.
Recently it was officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men, not even as visitors.
The exception is a guard at the door.
“It is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has experienced sexual violence on her flight,” says Bahr.
“Men flee because of wars because they are politically persecuted, because they are threatened with torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as bearers of hope,” she says.
In women, other reasons for escaping prevail: “Many secretly steal from it because they don’t see any other way out.”
In their home country, they have experienced sexual violence, coercion, homicide, slavery or forced prostitution.
That's what drives them.
On the escape, that goes on.
“The fact that a tractorer, for example, demands a sexual act for a bottle of water is not uncommon,” says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Whoever believes that the end, as soon as they arrive in Germany, is wrong, says Bahr.
Here too, single women in refugee accommodations would often be considered to be of lower quality and at worst abused.
This results in around 90 percent of women living in the accommodation in Munich’s north being traumatized, she estimates.
"Some of the children were not born voluntarily."
Many women are so accustomed to saying nothing.
"Or they don't trust to talk openly about the experience because the shame is too big."
Since they often don’t know how to help each other, it needs more accommodation just for them, Bahr demands.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.
When asked whether they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction, some answered by no.
In Oberpfalz and Oberfranken, there is no such thing in government accommodations.
Even in Schwaben alone, refugees are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, a government spokesman.
In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle Franconia, some communal accommodations have floors or own homes only for single women and their children.
The exception is Lower Bavaria, where there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separately from men.
In a study published for the committee, it says: "It is very important that men and women are accommodated separately."
"If privacy fails or men and women are housed together, violence against women may continue to occur".
Especially the laundry rooms should be separate and easily accessible for women, says the study.
How much women feel of this need of protection can be read at the Andrang, which exists on the house in Munich.
"Since we've talked about it, we've got a long waiting list," says Bahr.
You could easily build a second house.
Assistant doctors strike: demands for new labour-fighting measures
Deputy representatives of assistant doctors have called on their unions to approve new labour-fighting measures in their disputes over a new contract.
The JDC (Junior Doctors Committee) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has asked its entire council to approve more work-fighting measures from early September.
The JDC said it had refused to address the concerns about the treaty.
Assistant doctors and medical students voted in July on the rejection of a contract agreed with BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to the members posted on Twitter on Thursday evening, JDC chairwoman Ellen McCourt said the government would remain "persistently calm" on issues, leading to the contract being rejected.
"In view of this, the JDC Board of Directors has voted to completely reject the proposed new treaty and called for official renegotiations with all of your concerns."
In response to the government’s silence, the JDC Board of Directors today filed a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating labour-fighting measures beginning in early September.
The disputes resulted in assistant doctors strike six times this year, the first overall failures in the history of the NHS.
BMA Assistant Doctor Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed contract terms recommended by BMA.
He informed BMA members during the meetings, which were held before the vote by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students, that the contract was beneficial and should be accepted.
After the vote, health minister Jeremy Hunt said the contract for doctors in England would be introduced by force.
Russia and Turkey: An “Alliance of Foreigners”?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end to the eight-month-long war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin welcomes his Turkish counterpart in the gold-plated hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most.
There was the handcuff, yes.
But Putin’s smile seemed narrow-minded and he hardly radiated heat, even for his reluctant relationships.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his “love friend” Putin – according to a report five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to its old pre-crisis level, but would even improve.
The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved as if nothing bad had ever happened.
His enthusiasm seemed to be the opposite.
But one of Putin’s radiant, sustainable colds showed that Russia’s head of state had forgotten nothing.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shooting down of a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border by Turkey.
Moscow’s reaction at the time was furious.
Putin dismissed and accused Ankara of falling Russia in the back.
The crime was even greater, as it was committed by an alleged friend.
Re-establishing confidence will be difficult, if not impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, state-controlled media carried out a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.
The most serious were the allegations by senior officials that Erdogan’s own family had benefited from the illegal oil trade in areas controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He has vehemently opposed this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official embassy said it was time to look forward.
Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received from President Erdogan the apology he wanted to hear.
Russia was able to book some sort of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clear.
Erdogan needs first and foremost all the friends he can get after being deposed in a failed coup last month almost from his office.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shocked him.
But there are also economic reasons.
Russian sanctions have severely affected Turkey – in particular the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has decreased by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be eased when the flights are resumed.
They count on a late-season hurricane to the Mediterranean.
This week, state television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish agrarian imports are allowed back.
A report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows: "Tourists long there, tomatoes long here."
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West as it sees its reaction to the attempted takeover as a weak response.
In addition to this, there is an ongoing grin over the timing of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is keen to benefit from the cold mood and reduce Turkey's relationship with the West.
The Russian head of state certainly won a bonus in Ankara for demanding support for the elected state bodies after the attempted coup.
This is well-known to Moscow as a self-evidence, which even has a deep fear of regime change.
The summit in this glamorous seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey, as an analyst once described me, to represent an "alienation of outsiders": two countries that are broken and ill-treated by the West and now allied.
Yet, despite the public reconciliation, there are still major differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently took on the role of peacekeepers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It could be significant that, after nearly three hours of initial talks, the two presidents said at the press conference that they had not even stripped the issue.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize them.
There is no unambiguous consensus on where a common denominator to Syria can be found.
But after months of open hostilities – and given the potential for a complete disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter jet – it is certainly better that the two heads of state at least talk to each other again.
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside of Scotland
The RBS brand is to be reduced to a back-office role, according to the bank’s CEO.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank’s global ambitions.
The bank has since distanced itself when it had to be almost collapsed and rescued eight years ago.
During this time, brand strategists used "RBS" to protect other end-user financial brands.
She supported the international sport with millions of pounds in sponsorship, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to focus more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralized headquarters and the stock exchange will change to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for the private customer business that will gain more importance – Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt’s Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: “The RSB brand will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed, as we will now become more a bank of brands.”
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I am now saying that we are not pursuing global goals, but local goals.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the visibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.
“It’s time for us to evolve into a bank of brands, because how do we focus inside (we asked) on making this a better bank for customers?” said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said we would be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands.
But with our work, focusing on customer needs and not our own, I think, you will see many changes.
We can re-launch these brands, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori wins 3,000 at Newmarket on Predilection
Dettori Sprays Champagne After a Double at Newmarket, Bringing Him 3,000 Profits
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th UK win at Newmarket on Friday.
He set a milestone on Predilection, which is coached by John Gosden, on his local race track with his second win of the night.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner Dettori, who previously won on Ghayyar, said, "It's something special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too.
I am very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday night with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very humble.
Dettori takes up the joy as he wins on Predilection
Two Jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race – Jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who achieved more than 4,300 wins in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time Derby winner, had 4,493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modernity and it’s no surprise that he has reached this milestone that only a few have reached before him.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intelligence that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have been enthusiastic fans for years for this sport.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have already won 6,000 wins if he weren’t just a weekend and big tournament jockey!
Frankie has been winning in the UK for almost 30 years, which is great.
He has a lively personality, which is good for a British race, but beyond that, he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the pendant of the British flat race for two decades.
It was nerve-wracking.
A whole series of major tournament wins, including his famous "Glorious Seven" in 1996 in Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban.
Three years ago, he had difficulties at first when he returned from his six-month lockdown, but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to challenge his doubters and return to his best form.
And he's not long over yet - Dettori has previously said that he wants to continue in competitions until he's at least 50 years old.
Russia's Putin fires Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly fired his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of Putin’s closest circle of trust for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport Affairs.
In a statement from the Kremlin, Putin stated that without giving reasons, “Ivanovsk ordered the dismissal of his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration.”
Anton Vaino, who was Ivanov's deputy since 2012, was appointed as his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
The Kremlin website says (in Russian) that he was later the chief of protocol and chief of staff of the government staff.
Speaking about his appointment, he said to Putin, “Thank you for your trust.”
I think that the most important task of the government is to support your work as Head of State regarding draft laws and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin told Russian TV on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his position and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Are the smiling faces convincing?
This move has made Moscow a secret place.
Sergei Ivanov was for a long time one of Vladimir Putin’s closest relatives and works as he does for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.
As chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, the two men claimed that the chief of staff would resign on his own request.
But despite the smile for the cameras, few are convinced here - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of a kind of power struggle?
No one knows that right now.
But the official claim - that a man once praised as a potential president wants to direct Russia's environmental policy at once - was skeptical.
In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin’s website, Ivanov said, “It is true that in early 2012 I asked you in a conversation to entrust me with these very complicated posts – you could almost say – for four years.
As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov assumed the position in December 2011.
Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the State Security Service KGB.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov as one of the five people he most trusted.
It was once assumed that after Putin’s second term, Ivanov could become the president of Russia, as a third term of office would have violated Putin’s constitution.
But these posts were taken by another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became the prime minister before becoming president again three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson fired after hitting producers
Gibson was involved last month in a physical confrontation at the series set in Los Angeles.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced its termination in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized publicly on Thursday prior to the announcement of his termination.
At the set there were artistic differences and a disagreement of opinion.
I regret the incident,” he said in a statement.
Details of how Gibson's character is extracted from the series, which follows a team of FBI agents, are expected to be released at a later date, according to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old, who previously played in Sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been involved since the first season of the series in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have instilled all my heart blood in the last 12 years," Gibson said in a statement released on Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that will no longer be possible.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and above all the best fans you can only wish for a series.
The planned broadcast of the twelfth season is set for September 28.
Mysteries about fish that landed in garden in Banff
A resident of Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks it could be the 75 fish sandals spiked by a spring well.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, posted a video of the show on Periscope in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the northern deck of the Queensferry Crossing to the viaduct – which means the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "deck blower" approaching the completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.
Fife’s bridge section is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 slopes.
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown made a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnesses to an engineering art of a truly epic dimension in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used for this part of the bridge alone.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for fitting.
Almost 79 percent of all bridge decks are in place, and the last section of the deck today in Rosyth receives a concrete casting for the deck, which means that the whole deck is ready to be raised to its place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, Project Manager at Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: “The first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure represents future-oriented high- and low-rise construction.
After the installation of the last section of the road deck and its connection with the north tower deck under construction, we then had to close the existing gap on the north or country side.
This was achieved by dragging the northern supply bridge 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.
Massively, as the viaduct is 222 meters long, it weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards with a climb of about 3%.
Heike, since the tolerances the team is working on were small - on each side they were only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men have 'luck to be alive'
Three men have “luck to be alive” after being thrown off their fishing boat in front of Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station hit BST alarm on Friday at 13:20 BST after a crew watched the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulty swimming safely as their boat moved on from their own strength.
“We saw the boat turning around in their vicinity and imagined the worst,” said Moelfre’s head of rescue station Vince Jones.
" Fortunately, the strong winds have already swept the boat beyond its reach until we left it in the water," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man, aged 60, was found exhausted and hanged on a boje without a rescue vest.
They all got on board the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station.
Mr. Jones said: "The three men who were thrown into the water are happy to be unharmed and still alive.
Although the boot engine had an emergency stop, it was released from the person who was controlling the boat when the boot was stranded.
Somebody's been waiting for these men today.
Severely injured - Man stitches on his ex-girlfriend
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and seriously injured.
As police said yesterday, the 50-year-old had got the key to the apartment to get his personal belongings.
Instead, the alcoholic offender cuts off his ex-girlfriend’s clothes.
When he came into the apartment, he hit her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured on her hand and body.
The police were able to arrest the perpetrator.
During the 50s, his ex-girlfriend's clothes were destroyed, he called his mother.
He then alarmed his sister.
Together with her partner, the 45-year-old wanted to reassure her brother.
But she couldn’t move him to leave the apartment.
That's why she left the house with her life partner.
On the street they met the man’s ex-girlfriend.
When the two women entered the apartment again, the 50-year-old pushed his sister aside and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who builds Braunschweig’s cheap apartments?
The SPD and the Greens believe that investors will be taken into account much more strongly in the future.
How do you respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years?
The SPD proposes a "action concept of housing" for the next Council meeting.
Conflict is programmed.
First and foremost, the question is: who is going to build the cheap apartments?
There is no regulation so far.
SPD Group Chairman Christoph Bratmann says: “We agree with the Greens: those who want to build on urban areas will have to identify 20 percent of all apartments as social apartments in the future.”
However, the inexpensive apartments can also be created in stock.
However, the main dispute in the town hall is, says Bratmann: "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private spaces?"
“We want investors to build at least 10 percent, but as much as possible 20 percent of apartments as social housing.”
A new urban housing incentive program, which will cost millions and still have to be financed, is intended to provide incentives.
The problem, Bratmann said: "There is currently no agreement between the factions."
The CDU wants investors to make as few regulations as possible.
The left wants harder conditions for investors.
However, according to Bratmann, there is an aggravation of the situation in the housing market.
If the concept of action is implemented, it will provide additional tasks in the construction administration.
More staff is needed.
It is unclear whether we will get the specialists.
However, the program is not yet complete: because about 1260 new apartments should be built anyway.
But how to compensate for the loss of another 1,300 affordable apartments, which will expire in the coming years?
By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.
To prevent this, according to planning policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm, outgoing bonds should now be purchased from the city.
In addition, it would have to be considered to bring housing back into the price chain.
This is possible in the west city.
In one stroke, the problem could be solved.
In the west of the city, deadlines expire at the end of the year.
Around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price list for cheap apartments.
That’s not what the owners want, not the housing companies.
After all, the number of social housing in the west city is again drastically increased, you are moving away from the so-called goal of mixing.
There is no longer a concentration of socially weak people in just a few districts.
The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion.
Group chairman Holger Herlitschke said: "For a large majority, the CDU must be on board."
They have focused on more construction sites for single-family homes.
But that does not mean that there is no compromise yet.
Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their free time staring at screens has been complained by many over the past decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people off the couch and getting more active.
The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then to video games and lastly to smartphones.
Therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.
Of course, I’m referring to the Pokémon Go Wahn, an app based on the characters first created for video games in the 1990s (later a comic book series, game cards, and other spin-offs).
Like many phenomena of pop culture, interest before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand declined somewhat in early July.
The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overloaded the servers.
Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémon that are tracked with a GPS and can be “photographed” (via a screenshot on their phone) or “captured” once they are found.
A generation who played the game when she was younger joined the madness and jumped for the sofa.
In the United States, the game led to a significant increase in steps that the "average" person puts back every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently announced the Washington Post that within two days of the game’s launch, the number of tracked people who practice 30 minutes every day rose from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data for performance enhancement.
Many public health education campaigns that want people to "take 30 minutes," "get out of the sofa" and "be active every day" fell on deaf ears because many public health messages are boring and come from people who look miserable.
However, the importance of sport cannot be overestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of getting cancer or depression.
Exercise helps in weight management, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people do something outdoors that makes them have fun.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.
Some people even make new friends on the hunt.
As always, there are noisy gamers who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could run against a door.
What's going on?
There's been a breakthrough.
Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity in the past, they gave us no reason to do sports like this game.
The new one will lose its excitement and use will cease over time.
However, due to Pokemon’s success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with real-world activeness, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles creates gold in dancing hours
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic on the jumping horse.
Effortlessly on the beam.
Awesome on the ground.
Brilliant on the whole line.
And now, at last, the Olympic winner.
The 19-year-old American tournament climbed to the multi-fight title on Thursday and increased the gap between her and the rest of the world in the light of the Olympics.
Their total score of 62,198 was clearly ahead of silver medalist and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
American woman Simone Biles will tour on the floating beam during the women’s single multiplayer final in the arts tour at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American to win a multi-fight title and the fifth overall while maintaining her reputation as the best of her generation or even at all.
She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey in this moment ended.
This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who have brought their sports to new heights:
For the past three years, Biles has dominated her sport, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic winner Mary Lou Retton said of her that she is "the best turner I've ever seen."
She was expecting a final exam in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.
Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be considered a disappointment.
The Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman hug each other after winning gold and silver in the women’s single multiplayer finals in the arts tour at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Biles received the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as a call sign at the farewell ceremony of retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles insisted that during her long journey to the top, never having planned for the future, that’s not really true.
Part of their grounding exercises – which include their typical Tumbling Pass – are tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic Arena in Rio.
That's not a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a young child and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman’s mother during a school trip to the gym where Boorman trained, became the force.
She hasn’t lost a multi-competition since the summer of 2013, a series of victories that will last as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafina led through two rotations lightly, the image was blurred.
Floating beams and ground tours - in which Biles holds the world championship title - were lauded.
She picked up again with 15,433 on the floating beam – and put another one on the ground with 15,933 on it.
Raisman embraced her gently as she expected her end result—a pure formality—and tears flowed on Biles’ shiny red, white and blue eyeliner, when the vision she once described in her book became reality.
Raisman’s performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a tie brake.
This time, the 22-year-old crew captain, called "Grandma" by the Americans, had a lead.
After her grounding exercise, she kissed the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed dubious.
As for Biles, the rapidly expanding tweet of the 19-year-old from the beginning of this week has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims shot in serial murder while listening to music in car
According to police reports released on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead in one of the deadliest attacks in a decade in Phoenix’s first serial kill while they were in the car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on June 12 while the car was parked in an entrance, authorities said.
The perpetrator fired eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car and then ran away with another vehicle, is to be read in the report.
Police said the triple murder did not appear to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the <0x24>2,900 that were in possession of one of the adult victims.
Phoenix police spokesman Sgt. Jonathan Howard said the shooting prompted investigators to take a closer look at whether it was linked to four previous attacks.
In total, seven people were killed and two others injured in nine attacks in predominantly Spanish residential areas within four months.
“It’s happening in a residential area in front of a house,” Howard told KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, earlier this month.
It is believed that the suspect used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to her injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis daughter Maleah are still deceased on the spot.
A witness told police that it was not unusual for her to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which targeted an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder, and it is assumed that it was the work of the serial killer.
Investigators found cartridge sleeves and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-Year-Old With Microzephalia: "It's Getting Better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But like the few of his peers, Edmund has microzephalia, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto did not know about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I can’t.
I can't do that.
I didn't let myself in.
What is not at all true -- of course, you have relied on it," she said.
Her husband Vincent and her were informed that Edmund might never be able to recognize her and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest institutionalizing it.
"My first answer to that was 'I didn't know people were still doing it,'" Picciuto explained.
Edmund can walk with help.
Edmund could not sit or crawl until he was three years old, and he still cannot speak.
But he is making slow progress.
He can walk with support and cycling.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund devised for "Please Sing Something For Me."
"We're teaching him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund has invented some signs on his own.
Microzephalia has a variety of causes: genetic as with Edmund, as well as infections with viruses such as measles or the Zika virus during pregnancy.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary greatly.
It is still too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with the Zika virus.
Picciuto recalls the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I was constantly asking what was going to happen.
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven’t been asking for the prognosis for a long time, because I don’t expect it to be able to actually tell me.
But Picciuto has a promising advice for mothers of infants with birth damage caused by the Zika virus.
It's getting better.
You know it will be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains, floods give rise to rescues in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rains and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to call the emergency on Friday, with more rainfall expected throughout Saturday.
Numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi flooded their shores and threatened large-scale flooding after extreme rains, the National Weather Service reported.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said that government officials are in constant contact with local authorities and that assistance to the affected communities is already on the way.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor’s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said demands for overseas vessels, boats and sandbags increased.
Steele said that only the municipality of Tangipahoa would have demanded tens of thousands of sandbags.
A flood warning system will be deployed across large parts of southern Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service reported that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area.
In southern Alabama, a flood warning system was deployed on Friday, while it continued to rain in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouges and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both of which are located in Louisiana, will most likely reach the weekend's record level.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann says both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a downstream flooding in Ascension Parish poses a danger, as these will only flow slowly into Lake Maurepas over the upstream rivers.
The Tickfaw River, south of the Mississippi State Border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached its highest level on Friday at 9 a.m.
Rescue teams are still feeding people from the floodwaters in the Amite and Wilkinson districts in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and step son were among those rescued on Friday near Gloster.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house, increased significantly overnight.
He said another step-son, who lives nearby, had warned him.
"We woke up and the water flowed and flowed in," Hansford said.
It reached my waist.
His wife Hansford said that in the 48 years she lived there, she had never seen such a high level of the river.
Hansford said he and his family members had all disabilities and he would be the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that emergency helpers had rescued all three in a large military truck and had taken them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they were housed by Friday.
Krautmann said the flooding had "spread rapidly" as there were still heavy rains and that authorities were considering evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil has been heavily sucked through the rains since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rains and flooding caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and school failures in five school districts.
CBS subsidiary WWL reported that a deputy reported flooding of 200 houses in Tangipahoa.
The residents were evacuated into two churches, now both flooded.
Mayor Robby Miller said the authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets that had been washed away by flooding.
Emergency accommodations were set up in the cities of Amite and Hammond to accommodate the evacuated.
"Once the water starts to go back, they will be able to go back to their homes," he said.
In the city of Hammond, Tangipahoa municipality, nearly two dozen roads were closed due to flooding and sandbags were provided for residents to take in, hoping to keep the water from their homes and shops.
"The last major flooding we had was in March," Lacy Landrum of the city council said.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississippi, emergency manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison County said it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast.
According to him, a handful of houses were reported to have been flooded on Thursday, but no reports have been reported so far on Friday.
Keith Townson, Manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen before," said Townson, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "perforated by bullets", survives shooting in Philadelphia
Police say the 6-year-old was shot in Philadelphia this week for the second time that a 6-year-old was shot.
The boy's grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents reported that Brown suffered several gunshot injuries, including in the lobe, leg, arm, and abdomen, but that he was consciously transported to the hospital.
"He's been through a lot, his little body was pierced by bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez told the broadcaster.
I just can't believe it.
The boy’s condition was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several surgeries.
The boy’s family informed the broadcaster that he was expected to recover.
He was supposed to start his first class in a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two aged 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old, who is in a critical condition, reports the broadcaster.
The other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether one of the injured men could be among the perpetrators.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that there appeared to have been a crossfire between several shooters.
Patron sleeves for storm guns, which were tracked back to various storm guns, oversaw the incident.
It seems that this has clearly been an ongoing struggle.
There were shells on the road, on both sides of the road.
There appear to have been several armed fighters here who were very actively involved,” police chief Anthony Ginaldi told the Philadelphia police station.
Several homes and vehicles were also hit in the area.
There were no arrests and police are currently checking the surveillance video, according to reports.
On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was hit by a crossbow on her arm while playing in front of her house in the residential area of West Oak Lane.
She recovers and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That’s what I imagine among the women’s Olympia team in the tournament and that’s for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been at every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And secondly, this team has three tournaments, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, which seemed to inspire many young girls of other skin colors.
The structure of this team, rounded up by Aly Raisman, who is a Jew, and Madison Kocian, who is a Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the United States.
It has consolidated the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years, the number one female tournament was an Afro-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were <0x23>1 and <0x23>2.
This shows strength.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic winner and America was cheering.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three-time world champions Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they provided unexpected but masterful gymnastics routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth heterosexual American to win gold at an individual multi-fighting event for women.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We experience the tip of this sport, but this is not how tournament classes look all over the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.
They are the "Last Five" because the next Olympic team will have only four tournaments in the team, and this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as coach.
But the reality is that tournaments are an expensive sport, and tournaments are primarily held in private tournament clubs, maintained by parents who pay for the training, decoration, travel clothing, competition and hotel expenses (for the coaches and their tournaments and families).
The majority of these tournaments are located in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.
In these associations, the Turners receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both coached their athletes since they started the tournament.
We need to enable countless young girls, inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, to have a more playable and accessible gymnasium.
I founded my 20-year-old tournament foundation.
At my events, we have offered free and affordable tournaments in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth (especially black and Spanish) and trained national and international winners.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high-quality tournaments that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Turning develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers lifelong health benefits as well as school and occupational success.
It’s the inspiration of this team to get thousands of young girls interested in the tournament and that’s great.
It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by getting the Olympic team gold and thank you, you have so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to start their way, healthy, strong and successful young women becoming.
Assistant doctors want to organize further strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt’s proposal
The ministers hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adopting a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistant doctors who voted in an election rejected it.
In July, Hunt had unveiled plans to forcibly introduce the contract, saying the NHS would be in a “nobody’s country” and any further delay would be damaging to employees and patients.
The first assistant doctors are expected to receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work to improve care at unpleasant hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, the chairman of the BMA Committee for Assistant Doctors, said last night in a statement: "Assistant doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will address the current employment crisis and deprive everyone of it."
With only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors falls under the new contract, progress must be made and time runs out.
Efforts on the part of the BMA to resolve disputes through talks with the government were based on reluctance to participate and sometimes on deaf-hearted silence.
This happened from a promise Jeremy Hunt made last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift the coercion and address the concerns of assistant doctors".
If he does not do this, the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further work-fighting measures.
The last strike at the end of April provided for a postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and specialist doctors were involved in providing coverage to doctors on the strike post chain.
The ministers had hoped to be able to end the dispute over the amendments by adopting the reformed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants a better weekly salary for the 54,000 assistant doctors who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, the director-general of the NHS staff, called on assistant doctors to end the strike.
Mortimer said: “Labour action does not reach anything of the few, but already overloaded teams and service providers, and only prepares patients, nurses and their families for worries, need and interruption.”
During the last two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Assistant Doctors and have responded positively to the Ministry of Health and other ministries on the concerns of foreskin and whistleblowing.
The employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as dispatch, flexibility in training, additional training for those who return from a workout, training courses, mutual recognition of the curriculum, health care, the education leave and the education leave in November and the medical leave in England.
The <0xC2><0xA3>2 per day medication that can reduce heart attack risk
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a <0xC2><0xA3>2-per-day medication after it has been recommended by the authorities to administer it to more people for a longer period of time.
The anticoagulant drug ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is already administered for 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
The NHS’s NICE regulator has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NHS’s NICE regulator has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Approximately 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year, and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fat-containing material in the artery walls that form linings.
When the lining breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that blocks the blood flow to the heart, thereby causing a heart attack.
When the blood clot loosens, it can flow through the blood stream and block the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, which is manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more unlikely.
NICE’s guideline draft, published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg of ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Center, said: “Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have had a heart attack, another heart attack or stroke – often with severe consequences.”
Fear of a recurrence of a heart attack can have a significant negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
Experience shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
With a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
Information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years. The draft guide does not recommend treatment that goes beyond this period.
Culture of Political Correctness Lets Election Fraud Blow Up in Muslim Territories
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year on the basis of a government report on corruption
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities knowingly being ignored, as a devastating government report revealed today.
Former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, election observers and council houses for ignoring evidence of election abuse due to "hypersensibilities about ethnicity and religion".
The former minister of integration and municipal government, now an anti-corruption king, said the intimidation of voters for religious reasons would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up blockade bands outside polling stations to intimidate scared voters.
He recommends that voters carry a passport with them to prove their identity in elections.
Currently, a voter only needs to name and address.
The report suggests applying non-removable ink to a person’s fingers when they cast their vote to prevent someone from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should get more protection, Sir Eric says.
It calls for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions from informal committees or working groups.
“This not only serves against election fraud, but also aims to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that is associated with it,” he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet election scandal in East London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that the incumbent mayor Lutfur Rahman should be suspended after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices in his office.
The court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical way" and that he had silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman is said to have "led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to elect him."
Up to 300 votes were either dubious or the result of an imitation in which one person chooses as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
In particular, he expressed alarm at the fraudulent letter choice - in which older members of the Muslim community had pressured people to choose a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, depicted, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including conducting passports to prove identity
The report states: "As evidence has been provided that pressure has been exerted on protective members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, to, according to the will of the elderly, especially communities with a Pakistani or Bangladeshi background,
“There were concerns that ... state institutions deliberately ignored such behavior due to ‘politically correct’ sensitivities regarding ethnicity and religion.”
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including banning political activists from editing letter-writing documents to stop "electors."
The report, which is being considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral directory from being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters for your ID before choosing.
Use non-removable ink on a person’s finger once they have cast their voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.
To carry out systematic checks on a person’s nationality to ensure that they have the right to vote.
A three-year limitation on requests for automatic letter selection.
Prohibition for political activists to edit complete correspondence and envelopes of correspondence.
The police are empowered to set up blockades for election stations.
A law amendment that facilitates an indictment for intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983 (People’s Representation Act 1983).
Prohibition of photography in polling stations.
Requirement that only English may be used in the polling stations (except Wales).
Intensify the training to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters go to the polling booth alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "astonishing" that no criminal record has been made after the Tower Hamlets case.
“The electoral court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputies inadmissible because of a litany of corrupt and illegal practices,” he said.
He was known guilty for a number of reasons - according to the high demands in criminal proceedings.
He also criticizes the ineffective "abhak controls" of the electoral registration departments of the town halls.
Sir Eric said: "The trial in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.
Our country bears a proud legacy as the mother of parliaments, but the alarming and concealed spread of electoral fraud and the denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation.
Insane for Kate Radler doubles and other famous doubles of Olympic athletes in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio are this week over French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proved to be an impressive double runner of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But this summer, the 24-year-old Olympionikin is by far not the only gold-fighting athlete to have his own famous doubles – at least not if one is allowed to believe in social media.
In honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are currently flashing on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympics that have more than a certain resemblance to Hollywood celebrities.
The Hunter and the Wolf: Team member of the U.S. team in the arc shot Brady Ellison, left, has been compared since his childhood to Leonardo DiCaprio
Aside from Kate’s twin on the bike track, many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain arch-shooter of the A-Promi twin Leonardo DiCaprio could be.
U.S. team member Brady Ellison in the arc shot caused a storm on Twitter after images appeared on which he looks remarkably similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star.
In fact, the archer got insane on social media and admitted that he had heard from his childhood that he looked like Leo.
"I don't see much resemblance, except for facial hair," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess I'll take that as a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be focusing more on this year: the striking resemblance between British midfielder Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian turner Aliya Mustafina, with her big, expressive eyes, is said to be able to go through as a double for Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the Glee Star Matthew Morrison for years.
One step higher: This user is of the opinion that Nathan is the "athletic version" of the Inception actor
Another lasting comparison was drawn between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similarly heavy eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova has more than just sun-brown skin and blonde hair like actress Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian has been certified by fans to resemble an "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
Strong women: football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar shape of face and eyes
Not the only one: A Twitter user was very happy that others noticed the similarities too
Theory put in space: According to this user there may be a reason for the similarity of the pair
A Twitter user explained her satisfaction that “the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical.”
In fact, American football star Hope Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as the gold medalist in the tournament Gabby Douglas, who has her own beautiful, wide-ranging smile, similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC commentator for the Olympics apologizes for his statement that a Chinese swimmer "died like a pig"
Byron MacDonald’s analysis of the fourth place of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at the dr 4x200m freestyle swim squad angered viewer of the CBC live broadcast of the Olympic Games on Wednesday
Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologize after one of its commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer “died like Mief” and died during the race like “a pig.”
Commentator Byron MacDonalds thought his microphone was off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m freestyle swim squad.
MacDonald, who had been brought on board the CBS commentator team to give more "color", could be heard saying, "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
Too excited, he went away like a squirrel, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second stage of the swimming season 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck, allowing Canadians to open the gap to China.
Viewers across Canada responded quickly online after being shocked by the sound and the language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "like a pig died"????
The idiot didn't realize they were still on broadcast."
Ai Yanhan from China was described as follows at the final 4 x 200m women's freestyle swimming cup: "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
The criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and hard, with many speaking to him.
Twitter users did not hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow, <0x23>ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all look like racists.
Shortly afterwards, Scott Russell, who moderated the CBC broadcast, apologized live for MacDonald's comment and said, "We apologize for the comment about a swimming performance broadcast."
It was an unfortunately chosen formulation, we're sorry it happened."
CBC finally apologized more than 90 times to people who responded to the comment via Twitter
Commentator colleague Scott Russel apologized on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and posted its apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald’s comments.
The network also apologized quickly and issued a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that it has been made possible for them to be broadcast.
We apologized to our broadcast audiences and to our followers on social media very quickly last night.
To clarify one thing, Byron’s comments related to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person.
However, they were inappropriate and a poorly chosen wording, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized in the broadcast and tried to justify his remark by stating that it was not his intention to interpret it as a personal attack.
“I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women’s swim season at the CBC Olympics,” he said.
"I was referring to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person."
Of course, there was no intentional disrespect and I'm very sorry."
Buyer in Primark angry about woman trying shameless underwear in the middle of the store
The buyers didn’t know where to look when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a Primark to try underpants.
To exacerbate the situation, she showed how she looked in it, pulled her out and put her back into the shelf.
She went on and tried four pairs of underpants in a shop at the Bouverie Place Shopping Mall in Folkestone.
The Primark store at the Bouverie Place Shopping Mall in Folkestone, where the woman tried the underpants before she put them back into the shelf
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear, "she pulled back and left the store without buying anything."
She said, "People couldn't believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the sales area, she took a pair of underpants from the exhibition, pulled out her own panties and pants and tried them out.
"She didn't even try to find a slightly more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, dirty like Oskar."
"Everyone looked at her when she pulled out the underpants that she obviously didn't like, as she put them back in the shelf."
She repeated the same thing with three more underpants before finally deciding that she didn’t like anything, pulling back and going out.
"She didn't seem to bother that she was watching someone - or to think about the person who might be buying the underpants she had tried."
Mrs. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said, "How disgusting to think that someone would take home underpants that had annoyed another person and that weren't washed."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Mrs. Davidson added, "As I have realized, the staff have been trying to pull the clothes out of the sale after she left - which is just as good."
“I’d hate to go home with a new pair of pants and find out that another woman hated them and pulled them out again and they weren’t washed.”
A spokesman for Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday, August 9 at our branch in Folkstone."
All the products in question were withdrawn from the sale.
How to protect yourself from gun attacks with Krav Maga
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Regardless of whether you are approaching you from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the trigger for your robbers.
When approaching you from the back, you should be the first to turn around so you can see your attacker and “get out of the line of fire,” Mizrachi says.
Then grab the gun between your forearm and your shoulder before hitting him in the face with your free elbow.
Then hit him with the knee in the strap and turn as the attacker curves off the gun from his hands, hit him in the face with the run and move backwards as they point the gun at him.
For attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shooting line, grab the gun and twist it so that the attacker cannot shoot.
At the same time, move the weight on the gun and hit the attacker on the chest, then turn the gun out of his grip before they move backwards and point the gun on him.
Sounds difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi is doing.
But remember that in the case of a robbery, it is safer to hand over your money - unless you are a Krav Maga Grandmaster.
Traveler Ian Wright creates his tongue for a guide in Europe’s dirtiest places
A British traveler underwent a serious examination of his immune system and gypsum flex – by rejecting some of Europe’s dirtiest and most disgusting places.
The moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, created his train on a Euro ticket, a shelf on the Piccadilly Circus, a washing button of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.
Before dyeing each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he would be able to do.
But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", brought some surprising results to light.
The idea of removing the dishwasher button of a toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact, there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
On his journey through Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he rejected left behind more than a bad taste in his mouth.
Mr. Wright was known for testing the resilience of his intestines by traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public railings at railway stations to washbasins of toilets, the task put his immune system definitively under a test
In the film, he said: "Already as a child, I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms, and mud."
In the film, he was well known for his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His sample plot showed a luminometer number of over 4,000 units.
In comparison, the luminometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to leak after its luminometer number was over 4,000 units, while freshly washed hands had one of less than 60.
Mr. Wright and the Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom
In the movie, he says, "That comes close to the worst thing I've ever smelled in a toilet."
There is nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not going to stick anything here because it's disgusting in here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio.
The company provides Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamins C and D to support the promotion of gut bacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Juices and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.
We performed crazy brainstormings that ended up saying, "Let's call Ian."
They claim that interest in intestinal health will become a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who led the film, added, "Let me say this - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had leaked some of the things I had instructed him to lick, such as the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film."
Of course, there were things where it was easier to get Ian to stain her and others where it was quite difficult.
I’m glad that we’ve recorded some of these dirty delicacies on film.”
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all lactic acid bacteria were associated with the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58 percent said they used at least occasionally products that contain lactic acid bacteria.
Social family destroyed before delogging social apartment in Saltash, Cornwall
An associate family left their social home after a de-login with a damage of <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 because they had terrorized their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall.
After being forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing association found the property in an irreparable condition.
The walls showed clapping holes, wooden pieces were broken up, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated to the walls.
The family was relocated and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for the house administration at Cornwall Housing, said she fears the apartment will no longer be repaired.
She said, “It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think people don’t have to live this way.
There are many things to consider, as this property will probably be considered as not so beautiful part of Cornwall.
The family is famous and their reputation is as well.
The couple had three sons who were living in the apartment in the meantime, and police said the terror that the family had added was street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking, and excessive screaming, fighting, and flushes.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an order for antisocial behavior in June.
In some rooms of the house, which may be demolished, old garbage was found
It was in the property where drugs were traded in the past that wooden pieces were ripped up.
Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and had to be called to the police regularly.
Cornwall Housing delocated her and her partner violently from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to withdraw voluntarily.
The de-login was hailed by eased neighbors who said their life was turned into hell.
One said, "They didn't kick anyone."
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times we tell the police here are unbelievable.
“We couldn’t sleep this morning.”
We stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, it'll be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Cornwall Housing’s Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager, said the family had refused to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house to which the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years.
On the overlooked side of the town hall were dumped garbage and old toys
He added: “It’s a shame that the tenant refused to accept any responsibility for their behavior and that of their family, as a de-login is always the last step that Cornwall Housing is considering.
This was a very difficult case, as the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be terrible to see for their neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, and the members of the community who bravely accessed us and provided us with the information.
I hope that this development will comfort some neighbours and convey the message that antisocial behavior is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress that is left in one of the bedrooms of the house after delogging on the floor
Workers of the house administration will now have to clear the garbage mountains that surround the house
In 2014, police raided the house and found over 70g of cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash worth <0xC2><0xA3>1,700.
Skeldon received a fine after she found herself guilty of possession of a class B drug for commercial purposes.
She claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being homeless, Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many room walls of the house were lubricated with graffiti.
Police say they will delograte tenants who do not comply with the House Rules
Angela Crow of the Devon and Cornwall police said the de-login was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not comply with the House Rules.
"This applies to those who think they can behave without self-defense, as well as to those who have been harmed by such behavior," she said.
The police of Devon and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behavior, which will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal panic after a deep-flying military jet overtakes beach
Sun worshippers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese P-3C Orion Air Force aircraft set off an incredible crash flight
The Air Force said it was on a training flight, but insisted that there was no security risk.
This was the moment when frightened tourists began to panic after a deep-flying jet crashed over a full beach.
Dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew almost in the tangible vicinity over the sunflower on the beach section of Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers jumped up as they understood to begin to worry about the noise of the nozzle engines, without first seeing what came to them through the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many vacationers who posted videos about the dramatic fly-by on social media, said: "It flew two times really very deeply past and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash."
Nuno Arroja added: “I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was going down on me.”
Tourists on Aveiro Beach were panicked when the plane came out of darkness and incredibly deep flew
The Portuguese Air Force today indicated that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so deep that this was the only way to recognize them.
The spokesman said the jet flew slightly deeper than usual due to poor visibility conditions due to nearby surface fires, but the air force insisted that safety was not compromised at any time.
Surface fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer, killing four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force today indicated that the pilot had to fly so deep due to the conditions - strong fog and fire smoke - that his vision was limited.
The plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise.
Supercup: Barca worrying about Sevilla
Seville - FC Barcelona is fighting for the first step to the first title win in the new football season on Sunday.
The Catalans will face FC Sevilla in the Spanish Supercup duel, with the rematch rising three days later at Camp Nou.
The winner of the doubles must give up on Neymar, who competes in the Olympic football tournament with Brazil, among other things, in the power trades with the lower Cup finalist and governing Europa League champion.
Goalie Marc-Andre is also missing.
The German suffered a knee injury during the training, so the questionnaire at Barca has been clarified at least for the first time in favor of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean International and Ter Stegen have been competing for two years in Barcelona for the status of number one.
Coach Luis Enrique has so far given up on a clear decision and left Bravo in the league, but Ter Stegen in most other applications.
Before the first mandatory game of the new season, the Spanish champion has doubts about the fitness status of the team, which was humiliated by 0:4 in a test game of Liverpool on Saturday.
Lionel Messi and Co. didn’t really know how to convince them at the 3:2 in the trial against Sampdoria on Wednesday.
Seville, in turn, has to digest the 2:3 defeat after an extension in the European Supercup against Real Madrid and aims for the second triumph in the "Supercopa de Espana".
Barcelona has been the record-breaking winner in this competition with 11 successes so far.
Ma Long in his own league for table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic winner.
The 27-year-old defeated his countryman and title defender Zhang Jike 4:0 (12.5.4.4) in a one-sided final in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday.
With this, the world rankings first got the "Golden Grand Slam" with successes at the World Cup, World Cup, World Tour final tournaments and just Olympia.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese teams managed to play in the finals as expected and played each other’s title.
This made it clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would win the single title in the sign of the Five Rings.
The last non-Chinese on the top Olympics was former SVS-N<0xC3><0x96> Legionary Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left alone on the plate, between the sets and at time-outs they had no coaches with them.
They had retreated to the stands and let their defenders go in a fair race alone.
"The matches so far I have played for my country."
"I play for myself in the finals," Zhang had rightly said.
After the match, gold and silver medalists placed with the China flag.
The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided.
Ma had to really fight with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first sentence.
After that, he set the pace on the record and left Zhang with only 13 points in total.
Due to Ma’s superiority, the expected thrilling match did not evolve.
However, there were quite a few stunning changes to the ball.
Mizutani won the bronze game against 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonow 4:1.
The Belarusian had suffered a rib injury in his quarter-finals against German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, after which he was under medical treatment, had to "finally" be satisfied with sheet metal.
By the way, the Swedish Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) had become similarly high table tennis quarters.
Donald Trump admits "violent problems" in election campaign
The leadership of the U.S. Republicans is plagued by massive concerns that even in traditionally conservative states their majority will be overthrown.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump now admits weakness in his election campaign in the former Republican Highburg Utah.
A rare moment when the usually generous and self-confident multimillionaire expressed something like concerns, as correspondents reported.
After throwing 16 rivals in his own Republican camp out of the race, doubts are growing about his success in the White House fight.
“We have huge problems in Utah,” Trump told evangelical Christians, asking for support in key states like Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
Due to false reports of his candidacy, he resumed his well-known media skepticism.
Weaving Republican High Castles
Utah is usually a safe bank for Republicans.
According to a June survey by SurveyUSA, Trump and his Democratic competitor, Hillary Clinton, were on the same page.
Other institutes see Trump ahead, but not with the distance that is common for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also considered to be at risk.
In an interview with CNBC, Trump responded to the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton’s move again: “Just as I have done so far.”
And she said, “Either this will be a success, or I’m going to have a very nice, long vacation.”
He doesn’t do anything other than “tell the truth.”
If it’s not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that’s okay,” Trump said.
Then I go back to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the Trump Party has threatened to scrape funds to support its election campaign should it not be able to present better polling values.
Instead, the Republican candidates for Congress are more likely to be put under the arms.
Olympia: Threeth Fraud in Doping Test
The IOC intends to establish a disciplinary commission on the case.
Kenya's lightweight athletes are threatened with a second doping affair at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
After a fraud attempt at a doping control in the Olympic Village, Kenya sent a trainer home.
The International Olympic Committee announced that it would immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official said the former sprinter and today's coach, John Anzrah, had passed a urine test in the Olympic village under the name of 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich.
This was reported to the team leadership of Kenya by the doping controllers.
The IAAF World Federation has asked the IOC to provide information on the case in order to conduct its own investigations, an IAAF spokesman said.
“Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent actions of the IOC, the IAAF will carry out an assessment,” the IAAF said in a statement.
“He (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and went out as Ferguson Rotich, handed the sample and signed it,” said Kenya’s Chief of Mission Stephan Arap Soi.
He was in the possession of the accreditation of the athlete who was on the World Anti-Doping Agency's training checklist.
Ferguson Rotich was over 800 metres in the Beijing World Cup quarter in 2015.
Four days earlier, Kenyan Leichtathletics Delegation Chief Michael Rotich had been withdrawn from the Rio Games.
He is reported to have informed athletes of upcoming doping tests against cash payments.
According to media reports, he was arrested on his return to Nairobi airport.
Kenya has been under special observation at the IOC after numerous doping offences for a long time.
The announcement of the more than 2,000 doping target controls imposed by the IOC before the Rio Games was unusually previously pointed out that athletes in particular from Kenya and Russia will be taken into custody.
Before the Brazilian Summer Games, the World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was passed a few weeks before the start of the Olympics.
As a result, WADA took Kenya from the list of countries whose doping is in compliance with WADA rules.
Kenya is considered a great runner nation.
The country's lightweight athletes won the most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.
A series of TV reports from the ARD have repeatedly raised allegations that doping funds are easily accessible in Kenya and that there is a significant mentality of sport fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had employed them in Russian athletics.
In this case, it was possible to prove that in this type of sport, the area was covered and systematically doped.
Russia's lightweight athletes were then excluded from the Summer Games.
Salzburger "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the year of Shakespeare, the Salzburg festivals present the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic love couple, similar to Romeo and Julia.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leonard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical to the Temple of Classics and fulfilled a youth dream with the role of Maria.
In the orchestra, the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he whispers.
We always say that it is very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and melody.
It is a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this play, Bartoli plays an older Maria.
She remembers her love for Tony with courage as the younger Maria plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First of all, because it is musically extraordinary.
And then there was Mary’s personality.
She says in her song, "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright".
So she's smart, of course she's naive, and she's very passionate.
"She is very similar to me, to my Italian character, which I have as a Roman," Bartoli laughs.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It is such an honor to work with her.
She is an immensely generous person.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Driving is a necessity for him.
You see it in each of his movements, in his eyes, it is his life!
It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a joyful approach to life, which is very important at all!
For American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the “West Side Story” is top-notch: “This play is about prejudice and fanaticism.”
Today we have the refugees, at that time the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the New Yorkers didn’t want them.
They are the same topics, and they are just as expressive today as they were at the time.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
London schoolgirl who joined ISIS was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, has reportedly died in Syria.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee said that her family learned a few weeks ago of her death in Raqqa, Syria.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air strike in Raqqa, the group’s bollard in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and died, according to her family, shortly after she planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
"One can only hope that the only good thing is in it - as a reminder and a warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone - to keep people from ever making this decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from East London boarded a plane heading for Turkey and then boarded a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultan's family was informed that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months.
Reid says Clinton will remain a candidate for the Supreme Court in case of election victory at Garland
Harry Reid, Democratic leader in the Senate, is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the deceased judge Antonin Scalia in the Supreme Court.
Reid said at a telephone conference on Thursday that he expects Clinton to select Garland "with a certain degree of certainty".
A spokeswoman for Reid later said he hadn’t spoken to Clinton yet if she would nominate Garland and he speculated.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton’s team would not cause turmoil with a new candidate.
Garland is the Supreme Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Raid said Republicans blocked Garland's nomination, including Lakai and aide to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump is unsuitable for the presidency.
Treats Wants Naked Calendar for "Women and for Men"
Treats Magazine is working with photographer David Bellemere to produce a Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats chief editor Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude magazine is different from old school playboys because "playboy is for men".
I do this for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar does as well.
“We must return to the depiction of timeless and classical nudity, where both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body,” Shaw said in a press release.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their pictures online or in person at open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish municipality expects mass evacuation
“Whoever does not adapt and praises Erdogan sits on packed suitcases,” says Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-near Foundation for Dialogue and World.
The Kurdish municipality of Germany expects to see tens of thousands of asylum seekers fleeing from Turkey to Germany in the short term.
In the medium term, it could even be "a few hundred thousand", believes the association's chairman Ali Toprak.
Due to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s tough move after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community in Germany is expecting a mass flight to Germany.
“In the short term, I expect tens of thousands, in the medium term a few hundred thousand asylum seekers from Turkey in Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition,” said Ali Toprak of the “World” on Friday.
Since the government overlapped Kurdish fortresses with penalties months ago, 500,000 Kurds are fleeing within Turkey.
After the defeated coup, more secular and opposition ethnic Turks are added.
Many will want to start over in Europe if they are further suppressed in Turkey.
“It cannot be that a state that hosts refugees itself produces refugees in its own country,” Toprak said.
The head of the association complained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Alevitic cities.
Erdogan wants to increase exit pressure on the remaining Kurds.
"They are the last large minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been eradicated or displaced in the past hundred years," Toprak, who is also a member of the CDU, said.
The head of the union called for the federal government to "position itself as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and his supporters."
Also in Germany, a "witch hunt" against Erdogan critics is taking place.
For the first time in recent months, I have not felt safe in Germany.
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and opposition.
Brand marking as a Gülen supporter destroys the professional existence of teachers and other academics.
"Whoever does not adapt and praises Erdogan sits on packed suitcases, by the way, also the chemists and secularists," said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-next Foundation for Dialogue and Education, the "World".
As the newspaper reports, referring to figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks were already the largest group of asylum-seekers in Germany recognized for political persecution before the coup.
As of the 30th of June, this number had been 11,386 people and thus nearly 29 percent of all asylum-eligible applicants (39,625).
This survey does not include those fleeing from war, poverty or hopelessness.
Asylum entitlements under the Basic Law are exclusively political, i.e. on the state side, individually pursued.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Go where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: Locals are not getting anything from the summer election campaign - and holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country day.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, they understood.
The election will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays in 2021, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
Because it’s no worse than before: summer holidays, heat and country day election campaigns – that’s a bitch.
The locals, who are supposed to be convinced by the voters, are on vacation.
Most vacationers who are in the country, on the way to Usedom, Rügen or Hidden Lake, are not locals, so do not choose the country day.
This includes practical problems: In the holidays, helpers who hang posters, blow balloons, distribute flyers, and at the end count the votes are just hard to push up.
Until September 4, 2016, the election and last holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern must once again pass the election campaign by the people.
The hot phase, if you can say it at all, has just begun.
And it’s also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD/CDU coalition, must fear for his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.
It becomes exciting how strongly the new AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of the coalition taboo.
Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, is making an almost indiscriminate election campaign, one can see from his big posters.
He travels through the country, distributes roses and talks a little with the people, just as his legendary word-carrying predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Otherwise, Seelering has got cold feet and blames Chancellor Merkel for the AfD’s blooming.
Their refugee policy, their "We make it" has accelerated the rise of right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful office now.
The CDU, with its top candidate, Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it is like to campaign in the right place at the wrong time.
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large public gatherings; Merkel's Bundestag constituency is located in the northeast.
But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berliners and Saxons there than Mecklenburgers and Vorpommerns.
"There was probably the majority from other federal states," Vincent Kokert, the CDU's general secretary in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently complained in the NDR.
But it hurts no one from other parts of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.
Otherwise, the Northeast CDU largely relinquishs the usual campaign stands on markets and in front of shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons.
That, according to Kokert, only plays a "subordinate role".
The Union has also noted that you are tearing the ground apart on the ground, that it must work hard to find a wire to the people again.
You go like the Left, the SPD, the Greens: they are barely present in the vastness of the country.
However, the CDU campaigner Kokert’s advice to his comrades is also self-evident: “You have to go where it hurts, namely where people are: villagers, golden weddings, every birthday party has to be used.”
Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called for his SPD to take on a particularly committed election campaign.
In surveys, the Social Democrats last stood behind the CDU (25%) and just before the AfD (19).
In the 2011 election, the SPD had clearly won 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).
The Greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, are expected to create the leap into the country day.
They make the holiday emergency a modern virtue and place their campaign largely on the Internet.
"Online election campaign," says the president of the country, Claudia Müller.
Otherwise, green voters go on a search for local voters among the holidaymakers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is just riding a houseboat through the Mecklenburg Lakes and still enjoys it.
Your impression: "White holiday in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment".
B27 Sanitation: Guest accommodations suffer from blockade
The speed at which the B 27 is refurbished has nothing to soften.
For those responsible for the construction work, which starts at 5.30 a.m. and ends at around 8 p.m., there is praise everywhere.
"They've made everything pretty sucky," says Elvira Tetzlaff of the Jet Tank Station.
This is a super team.
There is also no delay.
The construction site was planned to be moved south by the beginning of the week, until the end of October.
The reception of those responsible for the construction works is also praised, for example when it comes to the setting up of remedial entrances.
Since the construction site moved south on Monday and the blockade of the Aspergstrasse in Ofterdingen has also been lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg continues, the traffic situation within the town has relaxed.
Citizens can now drive from Otterdingen from the B 27 again on both sides.
The traffic around the place seems to be going backwards.
“There were some significant complaints,” says Florian King, Deputy Chief Executive Officer responsible for Transportation Management of Rehabilitation.
The inhabitants of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to deal with more traffic noise because many were looking for dirt roads and were more familiar with their ship than the signage.
This led to a number of trucks racing in residential areas.
Since the speed limits were not observed, the municipality also called for the Mössingen measuring vehicle to be reinforced.
"There were significant breakthroughs," says King, who once made himself aware of the situation on the spot.
There have been two to three flashes per minute.
The fastest one was on the road at 77 km/h in the Tempo-30 zone.
Since the construction site has moved on, it has become quieter.
For business people on the B 27, it is only a small comfort that the road is now open again for customers from Rottenburg.
Business people don’t like to look at the maps.
But the fact that B 27 sanitation has led to sales breakdowns in them lets everyone you ask see through.
However, some are more and some are less affected.
Those who have less to do with the "end customer", i.e. produce for other companies, for which the renovation has little effect.
Thomas Sulz also speaks at the Maier car house of a "highly slight decline", but also admits that, of course, "the running expertise is lacking".
The most crowded are the locals along the road.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the steakhouse, formerly Krone, finds clear words.
This is already a threat to existence.
Not only him, but all the restaurants have "hardly hit".
There was a lack of customers from witchcraft, balling and rottweil.
We have to be happy with every euro turnover.
Revenue cuts are estimated to be "more than 50 percent".
The road renovation has "rejected its operation by two years".
Half of his employees had to be fired.
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half had been fired, the policy would have reacted differently.
Instead, Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt replied to a question from payees as to whether there could be a financial compensation, stating that the guest house would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation at B 27. Now it must also bear the disadvantages that result from the rehabilitation.
Göhner knows from other counties where something like this has been handled more generously.
With all complaints, Göhner is sure that his guest house will continue to exist.
After all, the family business has been established here since 1715, he points to the long history.
He can understand that other regular guests are now less likely to miss because of the complicated traffic management.
If you can’t drive, it’s nice elsewhere.
Göhner has no doubts that his regular clients will return after the restoration work has ended.
Despite the crises with BSE and avian influenza, Göhner holds the impact of the B 27 construction works on his customer base for the biggest crisis his guest house has experienced in its long history.
Six months of construction work, that's brutal.
In the name of counter-terrorism, laws are constantly screwed up.
Following the recent attacks, the Interior Minister de Maizière is now presenting a thick security package.
But what does a tolerance status have to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the conciliator.
All of his proposals are "politically reliable" to the coalition partner, the Federal Interior Minister said in the presentation of his new security package.
You don't overwhelm anyone.
Other, further points would first be discussed within the parties.
I am also involved in it.
As Minister of the Interior, however, he was placed on results and on a "accessible consensus" within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizière took some time off before presenting his conclusions on security in the Republic.
But now they are all the more extensive.
One thing is already known, announced, challenged: that a new security authority should take care of cracking encrypted communications is not new.
Nor the fact that Germany has to implement several EU requirements on passenger data and gun rights.
The call for more video surveillance and staff for the security authorities is not surprising either.
In part, de Maizière is launching a second call for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD: he wants to punish terrorist groups and punish jihadists with dual citizenship for the German passport.
“These will be difficult points for the SPD,” the CDU man admits.
He still considers this to be reasonable and demands nothing that the coalition partner has no chance at all.
A few new ideas are also presented by the Maizière.
They have it in part: He plans quick procedures for deportations and more opportunities for detaining people before deportation.
Refugees brought to the country are expected to have their smartphones checked in advance and open social media accounts for a security check.
In the case of tolerances for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than before - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to hide their identity.
One of them is politically and legally delicate.
Some still seem to be inexhaustible and leave questions open.
And on some points - in the case of inequality of patients, for example - the question arises: what does this actually have to do with security and terror?
Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terrorism.
But it cannot be said that the perpetrators of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were concerned about safety given the high number of refugees.
And things that were deeply occupied by the people were not allowed to be ruled out even during the election campaign.
Internal security is very much in focus.
Only the attacks in the neighbourhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The uncertainty is great.
And yes, there are election campaigns.
Union and SPD are therefore increasingly positioned on the issue of internal security.
In the past few days, there has been a rise between the two parties.
First a lengthy dispute over the equipment of the federal police, then about a security policy collection of some Union interior ministers, in which the head of the resort also calls for a ban on burkas and a departure from dual citizenship.
De Maizière is also concerned here with conciliatory tones.
He doesn’t hold anything back from a double pass.
We have satisfied the discussion in Germany.
Re-opening them, it doesn't make sense.
And with a Burka ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package is constitutional in all corners and whether it’s actually “acceptable” for the coalition partner has yet to show up.
There are some things that could cause a dispute.
However, the SPD is also currently trying to profile its internal security.
Party chief Sigmar Gabriel first carefully signals a willingness to talk and says, "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increase security."
Volkswagen is still glimpsing.
Despite diesel scandals, the number of deliveries is increasing worldwide.
However, not all markets are running around.
In the revocation, there are vertebrae about a term.
Volkswagen starts in the second half of the year with deliveries of more conductive vehicles.
Europe’s largest automaker can continue to have a plus in the course of the year, despite the diesel fares, thanks to its many brands and some well-running markets.
However, in July, the core brand VW weakened mainly in Western Europe and thus again charged the total sales, according to the company noted in the Dax.
Worldwide, VW sold 1.8 percent less cars in July with 449100 cars than in the previous month.
In Western Europe alone, after China, the second most important market, sales were 14 percent below the previous month.
In Germany’s domestic market, deliveries dropped by almost six percent.
Brand sales manager Jürgen Stackmann reduced the weaker figures from July to two days less in Europe.
In addition, there has been a retention of purchases in some core markets due to "changed economic framework conditions".
In addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey, the British vote to leave the EU has also been burdened, a spokeswoman said.
In the U.S., where exhaust gas issues first escalated, there is also a minus on the line.
A big support for VW is the Chinese market.
Overall, the mainly affected Lower Saxony brand is still glimpsed by the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, only a delivery minus of 0.9 per cent to 3.37 million vehicles is available.
Sales manager Fred Kappler was able to show a further sales surplus from January to July.
1.3 percent more vehicles were delivered by Volkswagen during this time, 5,904 million worldwide.
Volkswagen had manipulated exhaust tests with a software.
In Germany alone, VW calls around 2.5 million cars to reequip the workshops.
In the course of the refurbishment, VW confirmed that the refurbishment of the cars had no negative effects.
After the reequipment of the vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power.
The automaker issued a "equal guarantee" certificate to the customer after the reequipment, but did not speak of a "guarantee", as it was called on Friday in corporate circles.
The reason is legal clarity.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen has now granted its German customers a guarantee for refurbished diesel models.
This was confirmed by VW representatives at the Federal Ministry of Transportation last Monday.
The Ministry of Transport has confirmed that there was a meeting.
"VW has to fully comply with the requirements of my Inquiry Commission and the KBA."
"Derogations from this are not accepted," Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) said in a statement.
VW has assumed the guarantee that there will be no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power after reequipment and all vehicle-related approval values remain unchanged.
Volkswagen itself uses the term "guarantee" but not, as it was called in corporate circles.
With the broad term "guarantee", Volkswagen sees the possibility that, for example, six months after reequipment, customers will come to a workshop with an engine damage – and this could be due to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
It is also in the interest of the customer to avoid any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust gas scandal, there is an uncertainty regarding possible guarantee schemes, as it was called.
Therefore, VW does not use the term "guarantee".
The Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee demands from wealthy savers a penalty interest in the future - as the second institute in Germany.
Bank chief Josef Paul said on Thursday: "It's only about 139 customers who park <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>40 million on day-to-day or day-to-day accounts."
The Bundesverband Deutscher Banken talks about an individual case and sees no signal in it: normal savers should "not be afraid to pay for their large penalty rates".
If banks store money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they will have to pay their 0.4 percent penalty interest.
This fee will be reimbursed by Raiffeisenbank Gmund from September onwards by private and corporate customers for deposits of over <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100,000 on day-to-day or day-to-day accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 will cost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 a year in the future," Paul said.
He has been holding <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>40 million for a long time, which could be raised from one day to another and which he could not use.
“They’re on my central bank account and they’re causing 0.4 percent of costs,” the bank chief said.
"I can't put <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4000 for every million."
The costs are now going on according to the polluter principle.
Putting the cash in the safes of the Raiffeisen Bank would be too dangerous: "I've already experienced four attacks, I don't want the fifth one yet!", the bank's board said.
Most customers would have understanding and switched to other forms of investment.
Few have moved to other banks.
The Bavaria Cooperative Association stated: “The ECB’s extreme monetary policy rate is causing significant costs for all banks.”
Wearing it alone is “an economically not permanently possible”.
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or transfers.
With penalties for deposits starting at <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 million, the Thuringian Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made headlines with its Skatbank branch in 2014.
Michael Kemmer, Chief Executive Officer of the Banking Association, said: “We do not expect private customers to pay surface deposit fees, because the competition in Germany between banks and savings banks is too strong.”
A banker said that at Lake Tegern there is "a client who is slightly more luxuriously equipped by wealth".
"This can become a problem for a small bank" if they keep money for free.
Founded in 1911, the Cooperative Bank Gmund has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
Renowned actors, athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region.
"No other banks are currently known to calculate a dividend for deposits from private customers," said spokesman Ernst.
Uwe Fröhlich, president of the German Federation of Volksbanken und Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), said in late June: "The threshold to go negative towards the private customer is very, very high".
Competition is hard, and it threatens the displacement of investors to competition.
Customers in Germany will not like this in the widest possible way.
Destination records: who actually buys sound records?
Lonely middle-aged men love records.
Before you rush to the comment section to overlook him under the pseudonym Not All LonelyMen of Middle Ages with harsh insults, this statement derives from current data.
According to YouGov, the so-called resurrection of records is not due to a boom in millennials that want to welcome the news of physical objects, but due to middle-life nostalgia.
Those who recently bought a record are all expected to be between the ages of 45 and 54.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.
It’s also not a horde of hobby collectors – it has an emotional significance: older record buyers keep their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But are the results of YouGov correct?
If this blog were a news report on TV, the camera would follow me as I walk in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest grey suit and slipping wildly before I stand up, holding my hands and saying something decisive like, "So, let's get someone close to that B."
So, let's take a look at it.
Even though Soho’s heart is slowly falling into its charm – hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where formerly independent sellers were based – there are still a handful of fantastic record stores.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part where I stand in close proximity to different men in such stores and try to assess their age and mood by observation.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, followed by Sister Ray (data: two young women, three middle-aged men) on Reckless Records (data: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably around the 20s), is meeting in London for a day and is walking around the shop.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I guess," he said.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These soundtracks, depicted above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I didn’t follow him home), dress out the walls of his living room.
The reason he owns such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he couldn’t afford when they appeared and bought again items he sold when he was young and pleated.
"Many of the things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. Things I was probably a little too young to buy them for me," he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are more introverts and like to spend time alone, adding: “I don’t smoke and I don’t drink much.
That's my truck.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he meets will meet the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media rush, people who have heard about the comeback and are inclined to buy their old records again.
From the conversations I have held, people have usually discarded their collections around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again,” he says.
This would explain the boom to fans of the record revival of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional significance of records?
It only takes a few seconds in a store like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers took advantage of the contactless payment system.
Some disc fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar sound disc shells, from objects that evoke happy youthful memories.
“I think sometimes it can be filling a void or possessing material possessions as a kind of comfort,” says Wez.
This is the case with me as a collector and I think it is the case with many people.
It’s an easy way to get mentally engaged.
"We're like their social workers!" a staff member shouts out from a stack of records.
A survey by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month have not yet heard it.
The survey also found that 41% own a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not own a record player.
At this point in the news report, I would probably look very worried while browsing a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works for Sounds of the Universe, has noticed a "trophic aspect" of the revival.
"Someone came in here recently and said, 'I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a radiohead soundtrack so I can put it on the shelf,'" he says.
This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
More product load, less music load.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older people, who come in slowly.
Fopp, who has devoted almost a whole floor to the soundtrack, has a more colorful audience when I go in.
There are couples around the 70s, tourists taking pictures, teenage girls and women of middle age.
Even if the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the aforementioned stores – Wild Beast’s latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz pushes out of the speakers – it’s good to see such diversity among customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but close psychological traumas are hard to detect when you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running around in the store for a few minutes and looks at the variety of records available for sale.
She's more likely to make a showcase than a grocery store.
She doesn’t earn much, so collecting records isn’t a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It’s easy to hear music from a computer or in another way, but the beauty of records is...”
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I seem to pattern the jeans hot pants, I observe a group of young teenage girls grouping around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter consider buying a Crosley record player.
On the left is a staircase, a wall full of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.
No one looks at them—perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far up that it is impossible to touch them.
It's pure "platform art".
But considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about.
It’s no surprise that a population that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends most on luxury items such as records.
Even though my research found that YouGov’s results are true, they ignore, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lovers that exist in reality, record stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard at school or in offices.
They certainly don’t spend their Thursday morning bumping through Berwick Street record stores and sliding through records, while avoiding the staring look of an odd, 30-year-old fake moderator who raises nothing above the shoulders of no-thinking middle-aged men.
The Greenland Thai is the longest living vertebrate - video report
Scientists say the Greenland shark has the longest life span of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who investigates the shark, says the record was with a female, assuming that it is between 272 and 512 years old and five meters in length.
French court rejects bid on demolition of shops in jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an offer from the authorities in Calais to sweep down dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
In a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be empowered to break down 72 provisional stores in which people within the warehouse sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, simply offer hairdressing services, or tea for 50 cents per hour in restaurants (40 pence).
The prefecture of Calais argued that these places should be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which poses a fire and sanitation risk.
Humanitarian groups informed the court that shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state-backed association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also stated that the temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people operating the 72 provisional businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were "absolutely understandable."
Judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than simply feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the downturn was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is run for the benefit of non-profits and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum matters for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in Lazarus.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.
In a letter to the Guardian, it was stated that the closure would be "for these children a disaster, of which the youngest are eight years old."
The two aid organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp had increased to over 9,000 - the highest number so far - after a steep increase in new arrivals during the summer.
Despite Olympic disappointment, Martin remains a fighter
Despite his disappointing appearance in the Olympic race, cyclist Tony Martin does not want to be undertaken.
"I keep watching the World Cup, stay confident and keep fighting," the 31-year-old wrote on Facebook on Thursday before leaving Rio de Janeiro.
He has no explanation for his miserable twelfth place on the sugar hat.
"I honestly find it hard to comment on yesterday's time driving," Martin said.
He had to calmly analyze the reasons for the debacle.
At the World Time Driving Championship in Qatar in October, Martin actually wanted to compete for the title.
“I’m going to look at everything we’ve changed lately.”
"This also includes my position," wrote the three-time timer world champion, who lost more than three minutes to Olympic winner Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland) on Wednesday at the 54.5 km.
Olympia: Tennis Profi Siegemund misses semi-finals
Laura Siegemund’s win ended in the quarter-finals of Rio: Metzingen’s 32nd World Ranking missed 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA No.
34) the semi-final of the Olympic tennis tournament clearly.
Siegund, which was plagued by back problems, was only able to pass their suspension once and was powerless compared to the previous rounds.
On Thursday, medal hope Angelique Kerber (Kiel/Nr. 2) had the chance to jump into the final round.
The Australian Open winner met the British Johanna Konta (No. 10).
As the last German tennis professional, Tommy Haas had won a medal (silver) in Sydney in 2000.
Two German DTB starters in the quarter-finals of the Summer Games were last played in 1992.
There has never been a German duo in a single Olympic semi-final.
Group rises at start-ups for live video game streaming
Watching other people play video games is a huge trend - Microsoft also wants to benefit from it.
The technology group buys the start-up Beam, which specializes in this hobby.
How much money is flowing for the acquisition, Microsoft did not announce on Thursday.
Beam started with its offer only in January and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can look at others while playing, but also intervene yourself.
For example, they can give up missions to players and confront enemies and provide equipment items.
Activision Blizzard launches a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sports.
Facebook is on its way to a global media event.
The advertising industry is already on the rise.
Employees of the startup, which has so far been based in Seattle, Washington, move to Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, California, as Beam co-founder and chief executive Matt Salsamendi said.
Therefore, nothing should change for the customers through the acquisition.
According to Microsoft, Beam will be integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console.
The market for live streaming of video game activities is currently growing rapidly.
Renowned platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was bought by Amazon in 2014 for nearly <0x24>1 billion.
YouTube Gaming is part of Google's parent Alphabet.
Here comes the Enforcement Trailer
Germany’s lawnmowers have to adjust to the next generation of speedometers: In various federal countries, including Hesse and Brandenburg, new flashing devices are being tested to be particularly efficient in speedometer transmission.
Vitronic’s futuristic enforcement trailers from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, in accident areas where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, on highway construction sites or bridges to be renovated with a temporary speed limit, there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that the speed limit is complied with there with a stationary flash.
However, a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or expensive.
The Enforcement Trailer is authentic: its battery holds five days in continuous measurement operation, the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.
With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can be detected simultaneously across multiple tracks.
Variable speed limits as well as passing bans by time, driving strips and vehicle class can also be monitored.
In the high-risk state, you can move the trailer with any car with trailer coupling, according to the manufacturer.
In order not to be simply stolen, it is lowered in measurement mode, so that the wheels in the armored and also fireproof outer shell disappear.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is designed to protect the flasher from vandalism.
Since 2015, according to Vitronic, the trailer has been tested in different states and is currently being used.
Foreign authorities are also flashing with the new technology: France recently ordered 100 copies, following an order of 150 copies last year.
UK gets silver in 7th rugby after Fiji Masterclass gets gold
Britain’s impressive performance at 7-Rugby came to a steep stop in the final on Thursday night at the Fiji final hurdle when they were beaten 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji awarded a master class in handling, side-stepping, backstage, line run and raw power to win gold – its first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was sweetened by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament where they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear defeat of the boxes, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day, could fall back on them in the final.
But regardless, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in the best form in this form.
It could be a consolation for GB – but it probably won’t – that at least one Brit will have a gold medal hanging around his neck tomorrow: Fiji head coach Ben Ryan, former England manager from Wimbledon.
GB had a hard way behind it.
Eight years ago, they lost each game to the Adelaide Sevens under Ryan.
They only lost one here.
This slap will hurt, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji started out wonderfully and let the attacks kick off GBs out of fun.
The World Series winners went 5-0 up for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. when Osea Kolinisau crossed the corner.
With four more minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuwai launched another attack from the right-hand corner, which he transformed.
12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.
A striking tackle by Mitchell stopped Leone Nakarawa's mountain to reach a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua scored a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the rebound and there was still more than a minute of playing time ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou scored through other weak tackles of the GB team and stormed to the line to make a goal.
The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.
It’s like Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB is still learning to play.
That's the way it is.
GB made basic half-life changes and closed the Fiji gap for four minutes, which was good for the first half, until Joshua Tuisova went through after a brilliant interplay from Fiji.
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game had long been in favor of the South Sea Islanders, whose fans sang, swinged flags and danced on the stands.
It was not difficult to admire Fiji’s playful approach.
Mata Viliame put the i-tupple with another try in the last seconds.
The whistle sounded, Fiji hugged and GB kicked devastatingly beaten in the lawn.
Earlier that day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-finals with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa out of the race in a bare semi-final match - Britain's conversion of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the boxes forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal under the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackle by Marcus Watson, Anthony's brother of the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by fighting the coach’s cancer to win the race
There will be no more emotional gold than these games, and that means that.
From the first to the last, 220 hard Hieve who entered history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found additional significance in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
The echo of coach Robin Williams was present when they rode to the second consecutive Olympic gold in the second round without a driver, the first women in the history of British sport to set such a benchmark.
Their dominance was absolute, after all, their 39th unrivalled bet, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes gliding over the surface with the elegance of the swans, which does not reflect the kind of triumph to each other.
Behind every gold in the ruder lies a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that makes the difference, and there was no one more helpful than the trainer 30 months ago who did not know if he would survive that day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
As he said, he was risky.
I had bladder cancer, which is surgical, and they did.
If you don’t, it spreads everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes the outlook a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was fortunate to be able to start treatment in early 2014, outside of the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if that is in such circumstances the right term at all.
I needed money, so I had to get better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walked around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would be enough.
That's how it starts.
Rowing in itself is already a challenge, but that makes it even bigger.
In the immediacy of the victory, her first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking about it more than anything else and trying to process his own fears.
Stanning, who was a captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment in an operation in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week. That's maybe something extreme, but it means so much."
It just repeats how much that means to me, how much I and Helen and Robin have worked.
It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anyone, so a huge thank you to him, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t have wished for a better person to train or a better coach.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.
The couple had a tough rhythm that their opponents couldn’t cope with.
Even in the last 500 metres, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to unlock, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very caught at the moment.
Helen called "keep in the process, stay in the process".
It is really important not to get involved.
We had a good start and at the same time we weren’t ready to do something great.
We didn’t want a fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, whatever we did.
The couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about their future.
Glover is due to appear at a wedding next week, her own with TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn’t mean to say it was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London, it took about six months to realize that I was an Olympic winner.
Everything was so new to me and I was so stressed.
Here it took about four minutes.
It feels so much better," she said.
31 years of exemplary clarity
Ruppert Göller, Managing Director of the Water Purpose Association "Veitensteingruppe", is retired.
The association is considered "exemplary across the Bayern".
A small French water supply as a model for the large water producers.
This was said some time ago in the original tone in a contribution of the Bavarian radio.
Shortly thereafter, the Water Forum of the Government of Lower Frankland honored the purpose association.
The work of the roadblock group is considered "exemplary across the Bay".
Rupert Göller, who has worked for 31 years in the purpose association, has been a managing director for 28 years.
He is now retired at the age of 65.
The water supply association of the roadstone group based in Kottendorf, Breitbrunn, annually supports about 150,000 cubic meters of water and supplies 32 places and villages with about 5500 inhabitants.
The municipalities are Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the town of Baunach.
There are water supply agreements for other cities and municipalities.
The current chairman, Mayor of Breitbrunn, Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was hired as a water guard in 1985 and was appointed as managing director of the purpose association in 1988.
"His tasks have been very diverse and they ranged from water pipeline construction and maintenance work to office and organizational activities, budget planning, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency interventions on weekends," she said.
As outstanding events, she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells (1994), land purchases in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation to farmers, the renovation of the high tanks (1999), the new acquisition of a central computer control (2004) and the partial renovations of water pipelines.
There has been no stopping and innovations have been constantly absorbed, because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her laudatio she praised Göller’s faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He has used a lot of heart blood for his water purpose association and he has lived the water purpose association as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the concept of success of the nitrate reduction group in front of the water forum of the district of Unterfranken.
He has received a lot of recognition and praise for this.
Rupert Göller, for his part, praised Waterwart Alfons Griebel, who has worked with him for 28 years.
He is the best water waiter and he was a faithful butterfly.
Together, we were an unbeatable team.
From his point of view, he referred to the construction of the fountain and the restructuring of the purpose association.
But the biggest challenge and the most difficult deployment was the pipe break at the high tank at Kirchlauter on January 3.
Here, at minus 17 degrees, it would have to work all night long so that the localities could be supplied with water.
The supply of neubrunn could only be maintained once, because the high tank of Pettstadt was filled with hoses.
The management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who is the successor to Rupert Göller.
Sopranist Anna Netrebko openly deals with her son Tiago's autism - and addresses other affected parents: "They must have the courage to talk about it."
"The medicine has made great progress," the 44-year-old told the Italian newspaper "Corriere della Sera".
When the disease was recognized by her son, she believed that she had to die.
But now eight-year-old Tiago has progressed well and is now studying privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example: when I ask him something that is two years back when I sang at the Milanese Scala, he remembers nothing," Netrebko said.
But he is the happiest man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's connection with the bass baritone Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to Tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship status in Bargteheide - Man shoots comrade
A 35-year-old man shot his partner at a multi-family house in Bargteheide (Kreis Stormarn) on Friday at 10:45 a.m. and wounded her deadly.
"The man himself called us and reported that he had shot his lifemate," a police spokeswoman said.
The perpetrator is on the run, after which he is publicly imprisoned.
In the meantime, Sven S. could have been on the road.
The man is about 1.80 meters tall, muscular, bruised and has a smoothness.
In the meantime, the police have published a photo of him.
However, it is a few years old.
In the meantime, the man wears a smoothie.
The man should not be addressed directly.
He could still carry the gun, the police said.
Anyone who sees Sven S. should call the 110.
The police are talking about a "relationship status".
The victim was born in 1988 and the perpetrator was born in 1981.
The police in Lübeck initially did not want to provide information about the tathering or the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim; however, it confirmed that a person had been killed.
"It's a murder crime."
"We're not saying more at the moment," said a police spokeswoman in Lübeck.
According to eyewitnesses, there was a Special Operations Command (SEK) on the scene.
Steel - lighting for the German steel industry
The crisis-stricken and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared from additional costs in the amount of millions.
The financial burdens that threatened the industry from the eco-power promotion are off the table.
It remains in the release of the renewable energy conversion at the stockpiles for so-called own electricity production in the German steel industry, said German Minister of Economy Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) to the "West German General News" (WAZ, Friday issue).
“I’m really happy that we were able to finally achieve this after two years of negotiations.”
Accordingly, the European Commission had initially planned to ask steel producers who use the gas from the furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.
According to the German Industry Association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>120 million and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>240 million per year.
Gabriel told the WAZ that there is now a principle agreement with the EU Commission after talks with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators are replaced in the steel mills will an EEG conversion rate of 20 percent increase.
But this is also not going to be raised in the steel industry.
IG Metall welcomed Germany’s agreement with the European Commission on own electricity generation.
Thus, the status quo of the previous regulation is largely defined.
Gabriel’s successful efforts are of particular importance to the steel industry.
“In terms of our ‘Steel is the Future’ campaign, this is a first step.”
"More have to follow."
“Even in the reform of emission trading, climate and employment targets must be balanced,” explained IG Metall CEO Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
Since the financial crisis of 2008, the steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity and significant price pressure.
Last year, the situation continued to intensify as the world’s largest producer country, China, put mass steel on the world market in the face of weakening domestic demand.
European producers accuse Chinese steel companies of price dumping.
Over the course of this spring, the situation has relaxed somewhat.
On the one hand, import duties imposed on import steel, on the other hand, the economic outlook in China has become clearer.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
The German industry prime Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
At the end of the day, prices would have stagnated again.
The industry reacts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Lastly, Thyssenkrupp did not want to exclude closures of individual works.
Around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015.
In July, German steel manufacturers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.
They produced 3.4 million tonnes of roughly six percent less raw steel than last year, the Economic Association of Steel said on Friday.
After a brief increase in May, the production volume now declined for the second month in a row.
Since the beginning of the year, production has fallen by 2% below the previous year’s value.
The association expects an increase in emissions in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation.
Community, Mind, Health: Singing is good for seniors
The singing has been accompanied by Ursel Kipp her entire life: as a young girl she was in school choir, in the teacher's studio she occupies the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.
"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.
After a test, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall more alive, she says.
At the same time, she does something good for her health and spirit.
Because singing is a great hobby for seniors from multiple perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German Senior League.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like-minded people, describes Hackler.
Through regular relationships, seniors can establish and maintain social contacts.
Because social and family structures often dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "to communicate and organize, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of unity."
Singing can be stressful in a positive sense, says Hackler.
In this way, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.
Those who regularly demand their lungs do not breathe so quickly in everyday life.
Even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.
Singing often has a very special effect on older people, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Working Group of Senior Organizations.
In the older generations, singing together had a much higher value, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, she explains.
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people arouses many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
Through lyrics and melodies in particular, people with dementia are able to remember long-standing events.
When singing, the head is also asked for a special performance, explains Lenz.
At the same time, focusing on your own voice and a predetermined rhythm and adapting to the other singers – this is a big cognitive challenge.
Older people, who live alone, practice not just to focus on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition that is experienced by singing in the choir, says Hackler.
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
Self-esteem also grows by singing in the choir.
Showing yourself: If I practice for something for a long time, I get better and grow beyond myself – this experience strengthens.
There are good reasons to start singing, so there is enough.
Anyone who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, advises Lenz.
You don't sing alone - with 50 people singing, who listens when a tone goes next to it?
Looking for the right offer, seniors have different options, Hackler says.
If someone from the circle of acquaintances sings in a senior choir, you can simply join.
Many cities also offer overviews of the choir in the surrounding area.
Anyone who wants to sing in a church choir can contact the church or the church leader directly.
Many senior choirs can also be found via the Internet.
If you do not have access to the Internet, your family, friends or neighbors can ask for help with your Internet search.
Anyone who wants to sing should definitely join a choir, advises Hackler.
Singing does good to the soul and has something liberating - this applies to every age.
Cats react more sensitively than cats to cries of young animals
Biologists in Hannover have investigated the effect of calling cat babies on adult animals.
To their surprise, the miauen did not leave the males cold either - however, unlike the females, they always behaved the same.
Female cats can recognize the degree of excitement of cat babies at the miauen of the little ones.
They react by 10 percent faster to the noise of cats who are in great need, as scientists from the Veterinary College and the Medical College of Hannover (MHH) found out.
Although cats also respond to the calls of kittens - but always the same.
"Obviously, the acoustic differences between the miau of less and strongly stimulated male boys are either not perceptible or not significant," said biologist Wiebke Konerding of MHH.
She is the first author of the study published on Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology".
In a previous study, the research team had already found that the duration and tone of a kitten’s cry differs with the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult cats and eight cats from the animal holding of the MHH were observed.
They were pre-played for one call of little ones, taken from the throw-in box for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with cries of more aroused kittens, who were additionally raised.
The researchers consider their findings to be meaningful despite the small sample.
"All women, even those who have not yet had their own offspring, responded differentiatedly to the cry," Konerding said.
They turned to the speaker faster when this call of the very excited kittens played.
This ability may be congenital or may develop with the maturation of the sex.
“It was a surprise that the males reacted at all,” the biologist said.
In the past, scientists have studied the reactions of women and men to baby noises in humans several times.
Some studies also showed that women reacted more sensitively to infants, whether they were already mothers or not, reported biologist Marina Scheumann.
Podolski strikes with "Gala" after Supercup
Hakan Sukur is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, an arrest warrant has been issued against former football star Hakan Sukkur.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time since the coup attempt, an important football game will take place in Turkey.
Before the duel of competitions between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul for the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual" is fashionable.
Even when the state of emergency was imposed after the coup attempt in July, the government insisted that the everyday life of ordinary citizens should not be affected.
But this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is held responsible for the coup attempt.
There is no stopping in front of football.
Against the former Starkicker Hakan Sukur, the prosecutor issued a warrant of arrest.
Accordingly, Sukkur, who is currently living in America, is being accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
Sukkur is said to be a supporter of preacher Fethullah Gülen, who will be held responsible by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt.
Although the state of emergency, initially imposed for 90 days, is still up to October, in fact it has almost no impact on the lives of most Turks.
The nightly “democracy watch” in public places across the country ended Erdogan on Wednesday.
The sport, like the whole country, is divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogan.
Particularly fans of the Workers’ Club Besiktas have traditionally not been among the president’s friends.
What the majority of Turks do, however, in the face of dramatic experiences in history, is the strict rejection of military crackdowns.
There even the fans agree - whether you beat your heart for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
With the winner of the "Gala" Cup, Lukas Podolski will come back in particular.
The Cologne team proved its sporting value in the past season: with 17 goals and nine goals in all competitions, the 31-year-old finished his first season as the top scorer of his club.
In the final match against Fenerbahce, he scored the 1-0 win.
The newspaper "Fanatik" cheered him up: "He was the best in the square."
He finished the season in an excellent way and secured the cup to his team.
Thanks to "Poldi", the disappointing season for the record champion found a conciliatory conclusion.
After the preliminary round of K.o in the Champions League, the "Lions" also emerged early in the Europa League.
In the Super League, it only reached rank six.
The season was not good.
The cup was the only way to win something.
“We’ve done that and that’s the most important thing,” Podolski said.
For Master Besiktas, the year of play was better.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who set the foundation for the 14th title with 26 season goals as Super Lig goalkeeper king.
This is also the reason why fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old.
Gomez, who was under contract at AC Florence and only lent to Besiktas after the coup attempt, had announced that he would not return due to the political situation in the country after his European holiday.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it," said Fikret Orman, head of the Kicker magazine.
However, the storms should be ready to give up about a third of its estimated annual salary of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.5 million, Orman said: “We cannot pay his salary at Florence.”
Despite doping, these athletes still have medal opportunities at the Olympics in Rio
34-year-old Justin Gatlin has been suspended twice for doping (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanowa is not allowed to start in Rio.
Other supervised athletics probes can only laugh about it - they are fighting in Rio for medals.
The topic of doping still determines the headlines at the Olympic Games in Rio.
Russian swimmer Julija Jefimowa, who had complained about her right to start shortly before the games after a doping ban, was mercilessly kicked out and kicked out at her start (100 metres).
There was a cowardly scenario: with a smile set up, she was still proud in the hall and had provoked with her appearance.
When she realized she was not going to get gold, the audience burst into a hurricane.
However, there are a number of other athletes who, despite the past of doping, start at the Rio Olympics.
Here is an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m-Staff/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.
He was suspended twice for doping (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his ban, the 2004 Olympic winner and former World Champion has been running even faster than before, he is the number one in the world in over 100 m in 9.80 seconds and is considered the biggest challenger by Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100-m-staff/Jamaica): The two-time Olympic winner and seven-time World Champion had to sit a six-month lockdown in 2010 after she was shown to take the painkiller Oxycodon.
She had severe tooth pain after surgery, the 29-year-old defended herself.
Sandra Perkovic (discuss/Croatia): In 2011, the Olympic winner from 2012, World Champion from 2013 and European Champion from 2010 to 2016 was tested positive for the banned stimulant Methylhexanamine.
Perkovic contested the deliberate intake and was suspended for six months.
The four largest throws this year go to the account of the big gold favorite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m-Staff/USA): The Beijing Olympic winner and double world champion over 400 m, was tested positive in 2010 and locked for 21 months.
A means of penis enlargement was responsible, Merritt said.
This year, the 30-year-old over 200 and 400 m is the fastest man in the world.
Ivan Tichon (Hammerwurf, Belarus): It is unlikely that so many medals were later recognized by an athlete.
Thus, Tichon lost his 2005 World Cup title nine years later after he was diagnosed with testosterone doping.
The now 40-year-old also had to give up Olympic silver in 2004 due to steroid doping and the 2006 European Championship title due to testosterone abuse.
He was awarded the Bronze Medal at the 2008 Olympics, which was also recognized by the International Sports Court of Cassation.
With 80.04 m, he ranks second in the world rankings.
Liu Hong (20 km walk, China): The world record and gold favorite was tested positive only in May, but is still allowed to start in Rio.
The 29-year-old world champion found evidence of taking a banned dietary supplement, the WADA World Anti-Doping Agency’s lockdown fell mild and ran off on July 13.
Bombing attack in Thailand - Austrian woman injured - Multiple dead
The Austrian embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, Foreign Ministry spokesman Thomas Schnöll said on Friday.
She suffered cuts and was treated in the hospital, but has already been able to leave her.
She planned her trip home in early September.
Whether the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also affected by Austrian citizens is unclear.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities in this regard, says Schnöll.
About 200 kilometers south of the capital city of Bangkok, Hua Hin, two bombs exploded in an outskirts district on Thursday night.
According to police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including three Austrians, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
On Friday morning, two more explosives were lifted, with another person being killed, according to the authorities.
A bomb blast was also reported from Phuket in the early hours.
In the detonation near the popular beach in Patong, a taxi driver was injured, according to police.
Then another bomb exploded in Surat Thani on the southeast coast of the country, killing an urban employee.
According to the authorities, the bomb was blown up in a flowerbed in front of the coastal police station.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast and in Chumphon on the southeast coast claimed several injured.
It is assumed to be related to the blasts in Hua Hin, he said.
"The bombings carry the same handwriting," Army General Danai Kritmethavee told reporters Friday morning.
"We assume that this is a coordinated attack."
It’s too early to speak out about possible motives – but it’s probably about the actions of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
The Thai police, on the other hand, said the attacks were not related to the Islamist uprising or international terrorism.
“This is only local sabotage, which is limited to limited areas and provinces,” a spokesman said in Bangkok.
Instead, it is assumed that the bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military junta.
The authorities had received intelligence alerts over the past few days about upcoming attacks in the south of the country, but had not been informed about the exact time and location.
It is unclear which group is behind the attacks.
The police advised their officials across the country to strengthen security around important government buildings as well as airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and amusement areas.
There are always smaller bombings in Thailand, but they don’t usually target tourists.
Hua Hin is a palace used over the years by King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand.
Following the bomb blasts, the Austrian Foreign Ministry strongly recommends following the instructions of the Thai security authorities on its homepage.
High safety risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla, as well as Preah Vihear and the surrounding area.
After clashes between security forces and Muslim populations, unnecessarily trips to these provinces will be discontinued.
Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.
This will have a great influence on the military in the coming years.
President and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to spark chaos as the country moves towards stability, an improvement in economic conditions and tourism.
The military round, which had taken power in 2014 after a phase of bloody unrest, is in favor of bringing the kingdom back to stability and order.
However, the military has also failed to cope with the years-long uprising of Muslim rebels in the far south of the country.
More than 6,500 people have already been killed in the conflict.
Almost a year ago, 20 people were killed in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine in Bangkok, most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest attack in the country’s recent history.
The right "Identity Movement" is in the vision of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.
After several country offices, the constitutionalists in the federal government have also placed the group under observation.
"We see at the 'identity movement' hints of attempts to violate the liberal democratic fundamental order," said Hans-Georg Maaßen, head of constitutional protection of the German press agency in Berlin.
Thus, immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are defamed in an extremist way.
That's why we're watching the movement now too.
The "Identity Movement" is a group with French roots that has also been active in Germany since 2012.
It turns against "multicultural madness", "uncontrolled mass migration" and the "loss of one's own identity by alienation".
Constitutional defenders in nine states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hesse, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - are already observing the "identifiers".
Maasen said his authority had closely agreed with the country authorities on the decision.
"Groups like the 'Identity Movement' are trying to get their target group to where it stands," the head of the Constitutional Protection said.
In general, extremists try to address them with youthful language, often with pop music.
Islamists do the same thing as right-wing extremists.
This is not a testimonial advertising for your own business.
Propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable there in a way.
That's dangerous.
Recently, reports of contacts of “identifiers” with AfD politicians came from several states.
Maaßen said he had no knowledge of it.
For constitutional protection, possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point of view.
It is about whether the party in question - in this case the AfD - is being targeted by certain extremist individuals and thus becoming extremist.
It is therefore crucial whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.
This is not recognizable.
In view of the sharp increase in law-motivated crimes and attacks on asylum-seekers and refugee accommodations, he said he would not talk about new right-wing terrorism in this context.
But in recent years, we have found that there may be right-wing terrorist structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freitaler group.
There may be other right-wing terrorist groups or minority groups that plan attacks on asylum-seekers, against refugee homes, or attacks on other right-wing extremist motives.
However, a German or European-wide control of legal terrorism is not recognizable.
The previous groups have emerged at the regional level or in social networks.
Concerned, Masses expressed concern that many attacks were on the account of people who had not appeared in the right-hand scene before.
That's the worrying thing.
Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum accommodations have not previously been known as criminals, politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right-wing scene.
"So many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, who were perhaps politically indifferent or for example elected CDU, SPD or the left, who have radicalized themselves by right-wing extremist sentiment."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes an Internet hit
It is not always the Olympics or world records that determine the headlines of the Olympic Games.
This shows the courageous performance of Robel Kiros Habte at the Rio de Janeiro Summer Games.
At the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that he was temporarily no longer visible in the TV images.
He simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected.
In social networks, Habte became a viral Internet hit.
In fact, the 24-year-old finishes with a 48-second lead and ranks 59th out of 59 starters.
But it was rather his not exactly sporting figure that drew the attention of the international media.
Why is the 24-year-old still participating in the Olympics?
The Ethiopian received a special start-up right from the International Swimming Association.
This is distributed to make swimming more popular in underrepresented countries.
Since most athletes run in Ethope, had just wanted to do something different.
Preparation is everything: Robel Kiros Habte is getting ready for the big race.
The first nicknames quickly made the round.
Some media described him as "the whale's robber."
In addition to a "prosperity belly", the English boulevard newspaper "The Sun" with "Dad Bod" made fun of him.
His time, he only scored with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 metres freestyle, did not matter.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also made.
At the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Eric Moussambani's running gave media attention.
Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea when he had to perform alone in a 100-meter freestyle run.
Frenetically, Moussambani was fired at the time.
The 22-year-old at the time only learned to swim eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.

Geretsried - The owner of a shop in the new place has been robbed.
According to police, the 67-year-old Geretsriderin had left her shop at around 5:30 p.m. on Monday, forgetting to close a window on the ground floor.
When she returned the next morning at 8.15 a.m., about 250 euros had disappeared from the cashier.
Traces of the perpetrator could not be found.
There is also no video surveillance.
Trump doesn’t see the election loss so close.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at an election campaign in Florida.
If there is nothing to do with the U.S. presidential election, Donald Trump already has an alternative.
He then goes on vacation.
If Donald Trump loses the November U.S. presidential election, he doesn’t care: “In the end, either it’s going to work, or I have a very, very nice, long vacation,” the Republican candidate said in a telephone interview with the U.S. television channel CNBC.
If it’s not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that’s okay,” Trump said.
He called U.S. President Barack Obama and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton the founder of the Islamic State terrorist militia.
Within his party, more and more resistance was formed.
Post Increases in Trade with Electric Carriers
An electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the journey is apparently large.
The Post plans to sell its electric vehicle StreetScooter as well.
Soon the company will start trading with the transporter.
The Post wants to offer its electric transporters on the free car market from next year.
"We want to get into third-party sales," a post spokesman said on Friday.
The company has been testing for months to sell its self-developed StreetScooter, which delivers letters and packages to other companies.
Post-President Jürgen Gerdes had said that there are repeated demands, for example by craftsmen.
According to the news magazine "Der Spiegel", the Bonner Group will soon enter the mass production of the vehicles.
In its post-production production, the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and layer.
Gerdes had announced that the Group wanted to significantly expand its fleet of electric cars and to make a complete transition to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long run.
"We are going to take a very, very robust step towards 2020," he said at the end of July.
I can imagine we're switching the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on the streets of Germany since 2014.
GfK leadership resigns after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK replaces its chief Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations came suddenly, but not surprisingly.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK suggested that the more unsafe the chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann is, the longer the successes promised by him remain.
Turbulence at the top of the Nuremberg market research company GfK: After again disappointing business figures and the resignation of the company’s management, the world’s number five in the industry is faced with a personal reboot.
GfK CEO wants to leave the company by the end of the year.
The chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board, Arno Mahlert, will leave the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September.
The board of directors was already taken over by former board member Gerhard Hausruckinger on September 1st, the company said.
He will officially take on the role of a "President Speaker" until a successor to Hartmann is found.
As a reason for the resignation, the company called "different views" on long-term business policy orientation.
A company spokesperson didn’t want to mention details on Friday.
Who will run the market research company in the future is still unclear.
In investor circles, it was said on Friday that the shareholders were the last to be disappointed by the continued success of the restructuring initiated years ago.
Mr. Hartmann has been at the top of GfK since 2011.
"But the fruits of the restructuring are not to be seen even after five years," he said.
Given the recent poor GfK turnover figures, any shareholder will at some point become restless.
“If that were the case with BMW, the Wanndts would do the same,” he said.
The company was unable to stop its losses in the second quarter of 2016 even after rebounds in the previous quarters.
With <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>361.2 million, revenue was 6.1 per cent below the level of the comparable quarter of the previous year.
Relative to the first half of the year, sales decreased by EUR 721.2 million by 3.4 percent.
Profits in the second quarter have been particularly burdened by the company’s declining value given its difficult economic situation.
The <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>139 million company securities, which became necessary in the Consumer Experience business, provided the Group with a loss of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>148.2 million.
In the second quarter of 2015, GfK had still generated a Group profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus slips in Krummhorn in graves: Eight injured
Eight people were injured in a travel bus accident involving 43 passengers in Krummhorn (Arich County) on Thursday.
Two of the inmates suffered serious injuries, police said.
The 66-year-old driver of a travel company from Eisenach, according to her, had to escape from a hit truck that was partly on the opposite track.
The bus left the street and slid into a grave, a police spokeswoman Aurich/Wittmund reported.
“Due to the location of the bus, people were unable to leave the bus independently,” she said.
The fire brigade frees the occupants.
Six ambulances and a ambulance arrived at the scene of the accident on Landesstrasse 2.
The unharmed passengers were taken back to the Krummhorn district of Pewsum by a bus.
There they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company.
The investigators called on the truck driver and possible witnesses to report to the police.
The charges per cubic meter of sewage from 1 October 2016 for the Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl sewage system area are 3.44 instead of 2.10 euros; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp 3.36 euros (up to 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3.64 euros (up to 2.18 euros).
At the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater charge will be increased again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are needed.
After a surplus calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic meter.
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, it was found that when the budget was approved by the Land council of Kulmbach, there were undercovers for these wastewater plants.
The Kasendorf market is obliged, on the basis of legal grounds, to operate the facilities at a cost-effective level.
From 1 October 2016, citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to take deeper into the wallets.
The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.
As Administrative Head Herbert Schmidt showed to the Board, a re-calculation of the fees for the sewage systems of the market community was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over and under covers from the previous calculation period should also be compensated.
Schmidt argued that all three sewage systems are relatively small installations with a very small sewage attack, which is between 6800 and 12,000 cubic meters per year.
Thus, due to the low distribution basis, for example, costs for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a significant impact.
In addition, the rise in sewage in all three plants is slightly decreasing.
Furthermore, in the subsequent calculation period, the three plants have, not least because of their age, experienced significant renovation and repair costs.
The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the plants for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp are almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that in the Azendorf sewage system the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage.
At the Welschenkahl pump plant, the almost 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be overhauled from scratch, and at the pond clearance plant Lop had to excavate the first clarification tank after almost 20 years of operation, the clarification sludge was removed and an additional ventilation option can be installed in order to keep the hydraulics straight.
Schmidt: "For these extraordinary expenses, the continued maintenance and maintenance costs, which must be taken into account accordingly in the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs, which were still significantly below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011/2012.
Steinhäuser made it clear that in the case of a small wastewater attack in the three plants, the costs for operation and maintenance were "completely exceeded".
In doing so, Schmidt added, the market community has been spared from major maintenance costs in the wastewater plants over the past 20 years.
The situation for these plants will continue to be precarious for a long time, especially since the supply area of the Friesenbachtal wastewater association cannot be expanded around these plants because they are more deficient facilities.
Bulgaria Reserves Inflation for First Time in 8 Months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% on a monthly basis in July.
This is the highest value (since June 2012) and the first above zero since October last year, when a positive 0.2% was booked.
The average annual inflation of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, prices of the following groups of consumer goods increased compared to the previous month: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and footwear (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and routine maintenance (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; apartments, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication; as well as education unchanged.
Snapchat "Anime" Effect Criticized as Asian Cartoon
Snapchat says this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.
With its filtering tool, Snapchat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in a way that already borders on absurdity.
You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The filters are unmistakable, proprietary tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All misunderstandings come to the public.
Snapchat filters have in the past attracted criticism, accusing them of the app promoting Blackface or white skin as a beauty ideal.
When it suggested a filter to some users this week that gave them slits, false teeth, and blurred cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "yellow face".
They wondered whether these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and the outrage were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced it had deactivated the feature.
The company offered an apology: The filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters and not as a cartoon by Asians.
But outsiders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of hurting clichés.
Others strongly rejected the anime comparison.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student, tweeted about the photos that the filter was "insulting and, to put it, unpleasant."
She added that "it's difficult to argue with the contrast of a very disgusting Asian caricature and filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-faced, but that the yellow-face has been pulled into the devalued extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural stalper wires.
American culture seems to be engaging in an endless struggle for diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in our hands.
And Snapchat’s large audience of young people—who are racially diverse than their older counterparts—could rather assume that they expect sensitivity.
If one of Snapchat’s filters generates an image that is offensive to a user, “it’s much harder for such things to remain unnoticed than it was before,” 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, a product manager and media engineer, decided to delete her Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In an essay for Media and in a phone interview, she said she believes racial controversy reflects a lack of diversity in Snapchat recruitment practices.
Zhu criticized the largely white, only male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: <0x23>DeleteSnapchat.
"Either they don't have a diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors working there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say what to do."
Others share their opinion, a complaint that has left Snapchat largely unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its employees and points to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a staff manager focusing on under-represented population groups and internal integration efforts.
Zhu, for his part, said that she will leave her Snapchat account closed and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to be able to say that this is not OK."
Military leadership falsifies ISIS intelligence, Congressional committee establishes
Military members of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than it would have allowed the actual conditions on the ground, a congressional inquiry committee reported in a report on Thursday.
The preliminary report, compiled by a Task Force of Republican members of the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Defense Budget Committee, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how officials assessed the efforts of the U.S. counter-terrorism efforts in Kashmir.
The Central Command, or Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence information typically denied by high-ranking Centcom commanders regularly drew a more positive picture of U.S. efforts against terrorism than it would have allowed the actual conditions on the ground and were consistently more positive than the analysis of other intelligence services."
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, a Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The leadership errors at Centcom reach the top of the organization.
The ten-page report shows in detail persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in training Iraqi forces.
Although there is no direct indication that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts viewed themselves as exposed to pressure from their bills, a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before Congress were significantly more positive than it corresponds to the facts," the report noted.
For example, a Centcom employee publicly announced that a military recapture of Mosul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigations, it's so clear," said Mike Pompeo, a Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the leaders of the Central Command changed the intelligence reports to minimize the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans brought the Task Force to life after they were told that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.
The report, published on Thursday, will be supplemented by even more detailed findings as the investigations continue.
In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports by the Inspector General of the Department of Defense are underway.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday, which coincided with some of the findings of the Republican Task Force.
“In 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created an excessively restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi security services,” said Adam B. Schiff, a member of the House of Representatives.
This process, said Schiff, "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," damaging morality among analysts and "laid excessively little room for divergent opinions."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they did not find any evidence of intervention by the White House with the Centcom analysts regarding a "certain political opinion".
The preliminary results of the congress’ investigations were published on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, the New York Times reported on investigations by the Pentagon Inspector General, which were recorded after complaints by Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on reports from Congress while the Inspector General's investigations are still underway.
“Experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions about the interpretation of complex data, and the intelligence services and the Department of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense.”
The investigations have repercussions on the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim now made by a growing number of members of the Defense Ministry).
But last year’s accusations raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
Criticism about the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of hesitations from more than a decade ago, when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a paper about how the then government under George W. Bush did not respond to the recommendations of many analysts in 2003.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting on Islamic State.
Last year, the team around Mr. Hooker, according to government agencies, noted that contrary to the government’s statements, airstrikes against the Islamic State-held refineries had no significant impact on the terrorist group’s financial situation, as these temporary refineries had been taken over by the <0xC3><0x96>lwart.
However, this finding was not published, the Times reported in September.
Centcom’s then commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the Legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.
USA win fourth match in women’s field hockey, a showdown with the UK is ahead
One day after she scored three goals over Japan during a 6-1 victory, Katie Bam also scored the first two goals for the American women's field hockey team in a match against India on Thursday that the American women won by 3-0.
Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she couldn’t remember having done that.
"I have no idea," she said.
I'm not one of those people who keep their gates in mind.
But she knows that: the Americans are 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are in the same place as the British in their group who remain unmatched after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of the two within their group of six teams will gain the first and second place respectively.
The first-placed will go a little further away from the strong Dutch women who lead the other group.
No matter how the game starts on Saturday, the American women have triggered a surprising twist through their success story, four years after landing in the last of 12 places at the last London Games.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had a hockey bat in her hands for the first time at the age of three (her two older sisters played sports at Drexel University), at the age of 16 she became a U.S. national player, the youngest in the team's history.
She missed the Olympics in 2008 because she could not qualify for the team.
Then came the year 2012 in which everything went wrong for her and her team.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became the coach of the national team, and so things started to get better.
“A cultural change, a mental change, and a physical change,” Bam said.
We didn’t have the work in London we have now.
We've been able to completely wreak havoc.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the towers in the first half of the game with a backstroke from the nearby area.
India had gone into the game without winning the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tense and kept the game stand from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game in their hands.
She performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then pulled in the middle and kicked the ball into the goal to give the American girls a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.
The shuttle was the first of the entire tournament for US goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who had to book a goal in each of the previous games so far.
She has a run.
Just like Bam.
"We are in a good position," Parnham said, but how well will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday.
In the midst of the rage of the Olympics, the Zen of the trampoline
No matter where you are, no matter how late it is, it’s the Olympics.
Events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly and inevitably a racing race between competition and pursuit.
It’s as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning staff that is delivered from the armrest shooter to the swimmer to the turner to triathlete.
You can’t turn on the TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor’s conversation in the waiting queue in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is at the Olympics for the first time and is a woman’s swarm of worms, could have been well-known under those names sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-being television advertising if he were a swimmer, turner or even scumbag.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampoline tour.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event the same.
Far from the center, partly in the shade, are the sports that are not generally recognized: air pistol shooting, bow shooting, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have the breast swimming and let it dominate for a long time.
But if I should modestly make arguments for my particular favorite, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it debuted in Sydney, it has been so sparsely perceived for the last 16 years that many of those I interviewed did not know it was an Olympic sport at all.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the U.S. sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline jump, and until 2012, it had an athlete who managed it until the final round.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians the prices for the women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
The trampoline jump has a certain external charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unclear ear for a clown school than it sounds for the Olympics.
At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but just a ground-based enthusiast.
It has humorous potential – the cartoonical shaking of its never-ending impact – but also the grace of turning and diving, the two sports that essentially unites it.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as "spring board."
Ascending winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a series of downward movements (turning, heels and salts) before landing on their feet.
They are assessed according to the official Olympic program by execution, difficulty level and "flight time".
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will face each other in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight.
In their pursuit of gold, medalists have to go further, faster, up and above, sometimes to the goal, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.
They pursue not only the target line or the starting wall, but also another high-profile goal in television broadcasting: that of the world or the Olympic record.
The targeted striving is noble, admirable, even fanatic – and it’s enough to make even a spectator cry.
But it’s also what I feel a bit tiresome when I watch these games myself.
Of this, the trampoline offers a breathing break.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is at the top.
A move forward is not the goal.
He or she peels off, seemingly as heavy as an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.
There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.
It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympics can only be.
The women’s qualifying and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men’s on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days starting at 2.00 p.m.
In the midst of the Olympia mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in general turmoil.
If awareness can only be achieved by identifying and targeting male athletes — as the male U.S. tournaments recently suggested by The Wall Street Journal — then Mr. Dooley expects his new fan community to air.
"One generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters demanding political change in Ethiopia have faced violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say zig protesters were killed during clashes with police during shootings.
Is Ethiopia going to break up?
Over the past ten years, it has been one of Africa’s most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, protests against the government shook the country and spread to more and more areas.
Last week, thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
According to human rights organizations, the government’s response was merciless.
Witnesses reported that police shot and killed unarmed protesters on zig.
Videos circulating about the protests, probably from last or early this year, show how security personnel beat young people with sticks while they were forced to stand against a wall.
The head of the UN Human Rights Agency is now demanding an in-depth investigation.
“It has always been difficult to keep this country together, and in the future it will be even more difficult,” said Rashid Abdi, project manager of the Horn of Africa at the International Crisis Group, a research group.
After Nigeria, Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.
U.S. military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians to combat terror threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia. Only a few countries in Africa, if any, receive so much Western aid.
Ethiopia’s economy expanded at a remarkable pace.
Its infrastructure has improved drastically - there is a new pedestrian train in the capital Addis Ababa.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Even though Ethiopia was nothing but a model for democracy – human rights organizations have consistently led the oppression by the government – the opposition in the country has been restricted, effectively silenced by dissidents.
Many were sent to exile or prison, killed, or driven into the vast desert.
But that could change.
“If you oppress people and these have no other options than to protest, it breaks out,” said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia.
The whole youth is protesting.
A generation of protesters.
There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to smuggling regarding the power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea; a fight for this ugly, controversial line claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less oppressed in recent years, could exploit and rearm the turbulence.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness are now exploding after years of pre-cooking under the surface.
The first one seems harmless: smartphones.
It was only in recent years that very many Ethiopians were able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones became more and more frequent and Internet services improved.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially during protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies hiding where they are.
Several young Ethiopians reported that they had gathered to protest.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since the Eons, the Amharas, who came from Ethope mostly Christian highlands, prospered in politics and economics while exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in flatlands.
But that's changing, too.
"We are about to coordinate under a shield," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The biggest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, who make up about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia’s prime minister for 17 years until his death in 2012 due to an unpublished disease.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.
Analysts say he was particularly versatile in seeing early signs of dissatisfaction and using special commissioners to handle opponents and make them harmless.
"The current regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively unclear reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he does not enjoy the trust of the Tigray-controlled security services.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such a uprising was in 2005, after thousands protested against elections, which, according to analysts, were apparently stalked and subsequently stolen by the government.
During the subsequent raids, many protesters were killed, even though it was less than in recent months and this time of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia’s leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new train, as well as for their measurable progress in the fight against poverty.
But obviously, this has not prevented the intensification of the internal discontent of the Ethiopian government.
And it takes on a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters attacked Tigray-led shops in Gondar, an Amharic city, and hatred of Tigray is becoming more and more common on social media.
Analysts say the protests put the U.S. and other Western allies in an odd position.
The U.S. government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it had closed that base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile region.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin stone wall."
Donald Trump declares Obama’s claim to have founded ISIS was “sarcasm”
Donald J. Trump on Friday tried to disperse the last controversy surrounding his campaign by stating that his repeated claims that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founders” of the Islamic State group were not meant to be serious.
This clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate’s ability to communicate clearly and understandably with the American public.
It also brings his comrades, who are trying to protect him during an eventful phase, into the odd position of having to explain statements that he might not have meant at all.
After making the statement at an election campaign event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump turned back on Thursday’s claim and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to imply that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Trump said he was simply sarcastic.
The tweet was the opposite of the previous day, when Trump said in a series of interviews that he meant the accusation was completely serious.
When Conservative Radio Moderator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump weaken the statement slightly by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it.
The last storm of criticism sparked down on Mr. Trump as he tried to focus his campaign on the economic situation due to declining survey values.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave talks on the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this issue again.
Reporting on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton’s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already proposed sarcasm for his defense.
At the end of July, he drew strong criticism when he thought the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later declared, "Of course I meant that sarcastic."
This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the linguistic boundaries in politics, and then to redraw back as needed.
“I think it’s one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans, how they arrive, and then, if necessary, ‘clarify’ depending on how the reaction will be,” said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates.
But I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of sharpening the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has adopted an even heavier tone as his poll values have further declined.
A new survey by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed a guided tour with great prominence in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor.
But while he is increasingly focusing attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Trump’s jokes have brought his loyal competitors into the uncomfortable situation of having to stand up to him, no matter how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former New York mayor and one of Trump’s most prominent supporters, made great efforts to defend the candidate in a CNN interview on Thursday.
“I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments,” Giuliani said, so he was asked about the accuracy of Mr. Trump’s statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
In this sense, it is true that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backstops, completely wrong, and that’s why it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, in which Mrs. Clinton served as foreign minister, allowed ISIS to expand by undermining the situation in the Middle East aggressively.
Before the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of revolving around and being biased against him.
He praised the “poor, miserable” TV experts who were trying to understand him and said, “You can’t do it!”
Some of the Democrats mocked Mr. Trump’s apology as just another proof that he was inappropriate for the presidency.
Once pushed above the price from the market, Café returns to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a barbecue cafe in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash, which did not have Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, he was pushed away by the prices from his Bedford Avenue storefront.
The soap shop Cherie, which replaced the verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals mourned it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.
Artist Molly Crabapple tweeted, "I know New York is a change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is excluded, and Verb is now a soap shop."
But if New York is change, then it is also reinventing.
A revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same employees and a similarly simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old cafe, the owner and manager of the new cafe.
He began working at Verb in 2001 and remained there until the end.
When a customer offered him to provide money for a new outlet, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot.
Verb used the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu are sandwiches with baking and cheese and there are garnishes such as capers and sautéed onions.
There are natural rice bowls.
The cafe no longer serves beer, for which there are fresh juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.
"Many old customers were also pushed away by prices from Williamsburg," he said.
Recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.
Even after she was moved to Greenpoint, she would take the road.
After the verb had closed, she stopped drinking coffee for a while, she said.
“I realized that it was in the coffee and the culture in the verb that I liked,” she said.
Now she’s drinking coffee again, even if she ordered a blended Chai Tea instead of her usual Iced Coffees, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been another longtime and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.
He went there before work and inevitably ordered the same thing.
“I came fourth after seven, every day like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Everything bagel with butter,” he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and include new ingredients in the menu.
Nowadays, Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he replaces his Everything bagel with bacon, eggs and cheese.
Rodriguez said he didn’t care that the soap shop had taken over the old business room.
In fact, the owners of the soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for verbs with the coffee’s cold-broken coffee as an ingredient.
"I think we're going to get into their offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoints have also accepted the café.
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he intends to exhibit it soon so that his new neighbors feel welcome.
The location also has other advantages.
A local juice shop wants to fill and sell the cold-brown coffee in bottles.
There is a chance that the cafe will expand to a neighboring building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a commoner and said he was destroyed on the ground when the cafe closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the premises and ordering a new coffee felt like a return home.
"I had to smell it," he said.
The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a rich meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his rise to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
As a fine taster, President Roosevelt had a fab for refined Fifth Avenue delicacies such as Pâte de Foie Gras and Maryland Water Turtle Soup.
His menu on that day was a bit more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potato purée and a plum pudding as a dessert.
“It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people,” said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."
The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coe's last book "Chop Suey" was about Chinese cuisine in the U.S., while Ziegelman in her book "97 Orchard" tells about living in a residential house on the Lower East Side from a food perspective.
Her latest collaboration, "A Decent Meal", which will appear at Harper Publishing on Tuesday, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at Eisenberg’s Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, snorkel-free snack in Flatiron District, which has been in the store since the stock market crash in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, ate truffle with potato purée and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered hackbraten, the couple found this appropriate for a discussion about food in the era of the Great Depression.
"Fulfilled foods were very popular," said Ziegelman.
There was potato bread, liver cheese and bean bread.
They were prepared from an ingredient and something inexpensive that stretches the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many strawberries that they serve them as dinner.
Coe laughed.
"It must have put itself in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table in an American household, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women cooked for male field workers and freshly baked pasta was served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War. "A Square Meal" records the ways that the country was dealing with not being the Slaraffenland anymore.
“It was a time when food became a central, tense topic for the Americans,” Coe said of why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budget diet was just as tense: mysterious foods such as bread and casseroles became basic foods that casseroles recycled as "a wonderful way to recycle food residues," according to Ziegelman, as cooks could hide unpleasant ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dry fruit.
Meat, which has been the centerpiece of American cuisine for years, has become a rarely served luxury.
Typical mixtures were tried, as a high-calorie and nutritious satisfaction had precedence over taste or even common sense of cooking.
During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this era, baked onions with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition at noon," Coe says.
Ziegelmann continues: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and baked onions do not match each other.
It was typical for many of the household recipes.
As never before or since, household economists – including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 – pushed the country’s eating habits in such a way.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become “budget politicians” and to meet the challenge of turning Pampe like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a feast of historic delicacies.
Particularly tasty are the reports of the government’s response to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover’s Lass-Mich-Cake-Eating attitude.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he ate like the millions-heavy man of the world he has become.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate in a nearly gold-plated dining room and wore a smoking.
He was wonderfully alien to reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor hadn’t asked him to make an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, the hiring of a housewife with no interest in tastes by Mrs. Roosevelt led to the fact that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most reassuringly prepared."
Many of the species from the era of the Great Depression, dealing with food, were rejected as soon as the land came back to its feet.
The legacy is based on our continued focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as on how science was applied to food.
At the time of writing the book, the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law - for example, how she could not throw away food.
"She had a real fear of wasting food," Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, "She actually made people sick."
There was the wind bag incident.
After the dishes were cleaned at Eisenberg's, Coe and they pulled out a dessert that they had prepared at home: the strawberry dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called Prune Whip," said Biegelman, adding that it was a common trick to miss a chic name for modest recipes.
There was no beaten cheese, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everybody was a little reluctant to dip a spoon into the brown glyphs.
Surprisingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe got a hit three times.
As a can-do budgeter said to his wife, "A couple of chopped walnuts would help."
Killed in bomb attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life at risk to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save the lives of others.
Now the 30-year-old has died even in a fascist bomb attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the White Helmets, a civil protection group that has saved nearly 60,000 lives so far, according to the photo magazine.
2900 volunteers are putting their own lives at risk to pull people out of bombed homes and provide first aid in the war zone.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: a video of the Civil Protection Officer showing him in an 11-hour rescue of a baby from the wreckage of a house, went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrian a luminous symbolic figure in the horror of war.
As a hero, however, he never saw himself, according to the picture, "For me, this is the real jihad."
“When I die to save lives, I think God sees a martyr in me.”
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack, he had spoken in a video about the last bombings in Syria.
The helicopters threw four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district, one of which was filled with chlorine gas.
One woman and two children died, seven people suffered from shortness of breath.
“We are now removing the toxic remains of the bomb so that children don’t play with it,” the picture quotes his last words before he died.
The deadly Assad regime bomb was supposed to hit terrorists.
Greenland: The oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.
This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna.
He was born in 1624 and swims well at 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - to this day.
Greenland sharks are only born with 150 years of age.
Gradually, the Greenland shark swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it reaches an average of just 1,220 meters.
Only when it comes to it, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to a saturated 2.6 km/h – and at this peak speed is half as fast as a robbe.
However, this style of life characterized by slowness seems to be a patent recipe for a high age.
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at least from a Greenlander who could be 392 years old.
"Crazy," Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock comments on this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates.
Although evolutionary biologists have long suspected that Greenland sharks are being stoned.
Only the evidence was lacking.
Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, after all, they live mainly in the ice lake off the thinly populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzenbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter.
Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks accordingly.
They measured their time-lapse when they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitzenbergen.
These sharks still make prey: In the stomach of one animal, researchers found the remains of a robber, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young ice bear.
They may be chasing sleeping animals or patrolling at the bottom of the ice lake and looking for corpses swirling down from higher water layers.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues are now examining 28 Greenland sharks that caught fishermen from the depths of the North Atlantic between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Spitzenbergen.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest measured 502 centimeters.
To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens cores of the sharks using the carbon-14 method.
This center of the lens is formed before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein are no longer renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had a remarkable amount of carbon-14 in the lens core.
Its birth, therefore, should be after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons experiments spewed larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
In the third smallest animal with 220 centimeters in length, the lens core, on the other hand, contained a small excess of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons experiments, so it was believed to have celebrated its 50th birthday in its 2012 study.
All major Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal amounts of carbon 14 in their lens core, which is generated by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon 14 clock for a 493 centimeter long Greenland shark showed a age of 335 years, while the record-breaking shark at 502 centimeters is expected to be even 392 years old.
It was known that Greenlandish females only have offspring when they are more than four meters long.
Now the researchers were able to assign the length to an age.
Since one of the animals at 392 centimeters may have stood at the threshold of maturation and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland sharks with breeding can obviously be at least one and a half centuries of time.
This is also expected to be a world record for vertebrates.
It is no coincidence that such Methusalemes live mainly in ice water.
The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland Forest, in whose neck was a 120-year-old harpon tip, was also captured in front of Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals that live there often runs on flames.
So they mature later – and age more slowly.
In order to keep them warm in cold water, the animals often become particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal deposits heat.
The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much greater than that of one gram of elephant.
Another advantage: they have fewer enemies.
“So a smaller animal lives more dangerously and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as soon as possible,” explains evolution biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal, on the other hand, should invest its resources in a long life.
Building ground in double pack
The topics of construction have been discussed by the municipal council at the recent meeting.
With relief, the committee took up the announcement by Mayor Robert Putz that "finally the marketing of the recently designated residential areas can begin".
After the land plots, parchment and settlement issues could be clarified and the applications for measurement were made, the sale of the land in the residential areas "Straßlweg" and "Schönau-West" (Bereich Binderstraße - construction section 1) is no longer in use.
The municipal council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential municipality of Schönau are equally appealing to young families and well-equipped seniors.
As it was said, construction volunteers can report to the town hall from now on, the allocation of the parcels is expected to be consulted by the municipal council at its September session.
In order to be able to respond to requests for the settlement of further commercial establishments, associated with the creation of jobs, the municipal council decided to amend the new plot of land use plan in sub-sectors, which was not created until the spring of this year.
For example, the commercial area already indicated there is expanded in the area of undertime lars by two plots in the direction of State Road 2112.
Frankfurt Benefits from Brexit
In competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg, the city of Main has the best chances of attracting jobs and companies displaced from London.
“It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit vote,” says Michael Voigtländer, head of the IW’s field of competence financial markets and real estate markets.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether monetary institutions can continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU.
For the so-called EU passport, they have so far been sufficient to obtain admission in the UK.
This is being used by large US banks.
Several banks have already announced the relocation of jobs.
The lobbying association "Frankfurt Main Finance" expects to have 10,000 new jobs in main within five years.
For Frankfurt, the IW, the headquarters of the European Central Bank (ECB), which is responsible for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervisory Authority EIOPA and the ESRB.
While the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is headquartered in Paris, it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
“The proximity to the notary bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with supervisory authorities,” says IW professor Voigtländer.
While Luxembourg is home to a large fund sector, as well as Dublin, the infrastructure declined.
Thanks to the large airport, Frankfurt is much easier to reach.
In addition, it points the city with easily available commercial real estate.
“It’s not so easy to find free, high-quality offices in Paris,” Voigtländer says.
On the Seine, the rents for first-class commercial real estate are also 50 percent higher than on the Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime.
In a Mercer Consulting ranking, the city ranks seventh, Luxembourg ranks 19, Dublin ranks 33 and Paris ranks 37.
Even though quality of life is a matter of preference: “With its already strong position as a financial venue for the European Single Market, Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors,” the IW concludes.
But despite Brexit votes, London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe, according to economic researchers.
This is also what the power ratios say: in London, according to figures from Landesbank Helaba, at the end of 2015, about 144,000 people worked in the banking industry, in Frankfurt there were 62500.
Gilead receives legal costs from hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A U.S. judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbursement of the legal costs arising from the Hepatitis C lawsuit with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from a compensation payment of <0x24>200 million for the violation of two patents by Merck, which were related to the blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead, after a U.S. judge had a pattern of misconduct on Merck's part, including a hand-in-hand and other Meckthi's.
In filing the lawsuit on Thursday, U.S. Justice Beth Labson said that Gilead is entitled to the costs incurred during the defense of the case.
Merck is trying to match Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck complained about each other and claimed ownership of laboratory works based on sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead’s medications.
US-backed troops say they have regained full control of Manbij from Islamic State
US-backed troops have regained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last ISIS fighters in the city left, a group spokesman said on Friday.
The Democratic Forces of Syria (DKS) are currently fighting through the city after the withdrawal of the remaining group of fighters who have been buried inside the city.
They have liberated over 2,000 civilians who were held hostage by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish told the DKS Allied Manbij Military Council.
"The city is now under complete control, but we are doing cleaning up," he told Reuters.
Clintons earn <0x24>10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday, which resulted in an income of <0x24>10.75 million for the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband, and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated <0x24>1 million for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton earned nearly <0x24>5.3 million in speech fees; the former foreign minister gave <0x24>3 million in income from Simon & Schuster’s publishing house minister for her time in Ausch.
Clinton’s vice presidential candidate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, together with his wife Anne Holton, has published his tax returns for the past ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency,” Clinton’s campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In a sharp contrast to this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and retreats regarding his previous promises to release his tax returns.
It is common for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although they are not required by law to do so.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have indicated a tax check by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal.
"They're on the train," Clinton's campaign assistant Ian Sams wrote on Twitter, referring to the release of the Democratic presidential candidate.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump’s special advisor, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything before the tax checks are over.
Trump’s critics, including Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney of 2012, have already made it clear that his refusal raises questions about wealth, donations to charities, business executives and various other ties, particularly with Russia.
Clinton has already stepped on the subject and posted a video on the internet on Friday in which senior Republicans call on Trump to publish his tax return.
On Thursday, she also addressed the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax returns," she told the crowd.
Politico reported that Trump paid no or very little taxes during the 1990s, and an economic journalist from the New York Times cited on Friday a number of tax lawyers and tax advisers indicating that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme named after billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that people who earn more than <0x24>1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama supports the proposal as well.
During an election campaign for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate has its seat here, demanded Trump to exchange their tax returns at a meeting.
Buffett said he had also undergone a tax check by the IRS and Trump was “fearful” of the voters and not the tax authorities.
Clinton’s campaign has issued a tax return dating back to 2007.
The Clintons now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The 2015 Clintons tax return showed that they only paid <0x24>100 of their income as a salary, unlike most Americans.
Their main investment was a cost-effective index fund, from which Clinton’s dividends and revenues of <0x24>109,000 were taxed.

Condoms with Chili Powder, Fireworks Promote Tanzania Elephant Protection
Conservatives in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to deter elephants from going to human-inhabited settlements – they throw condoms filled with chili powder on them.
The method has proven to be effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea for years ago, along with the U.S. nature conservation, has intensified its promotion by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania, a non-violent four-stage method to protect their homes and harvest them.
In the past, many spears have been used to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, which is dedicated to animal welfare.
"Since we developed the ... Toolkit, we have been able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities, with them being much more confident that they can keep the elephants from their fields without harming the elephant," said the CEO of Honeyguide Beltie.
The first two steps include illuminating the elephant with a torch and blasting into a horn.
If it is not distracted, a so-called "Chiliwolke" is thrown.
Chili powder mixed with soil is packaged together with a fireworks body into a condom, the end of which is attached to the ignition cord.
When ignited, the condom is placed with a knock and sprays fine dust of chili powder into the air.
A touch is usually enough to chase the elephant.
A last option is a firefighter who shoots a gold rainstorm into the air and causes a loud, bright explosion.
City Council unanimously decides: No kiosk building at St. Goarer Rheinufer
Normally, St. Goarer’s investment projects are accepted by commercial operators with kissing hands – but it is the retail trade in the core city that is considered to be expansive.
However, the city council now unanimously rejected the request for the new construction of a sales kiosk on the Rhine River near the Rhine balcony under construction.
“Basically, we welcome new business owners, but at this location in an exposed location on the Rhine River, this kiosk does not fit,” Michael Hubrath told the CDU group.
Jewish director smashes Berliner hotel after Israeli pre-election removed at "Arab" request - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unveiled a media outlet after telling him that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had not listed an Israeli prefix, as it had “demanded Arab guests,” according to an employee.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah" released his trouble at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel’s country list.
However, the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and eradicated?
It was written by Lanzmann.
Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol offers a way to select Israel via its own call center.
Looking for an explanation, the director contacted the hotel reception.
The answer he received there “shocked him,” as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said the measure was "a deliberate decision to manage the Kempinski hotels."
The reason behind it triggered even more anger in the director.
"Most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the prefix be deleted," Lanzmann said.
The Israeli ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, called this a “great shame,” reports the South German newspaper.
We were shocked and terrified by this event.
That's really very embarrassing.
The fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is an even greater shame.
That doesn't require an explanation.
We expect the hotel to "draw the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident triggered a fairly large resonance on the Internet, where people called the whole thing a scandal.
Some submitted to the Kempinski Hotel that it had "received" the alleged requests of Arab guests.
"Shame on you," another post said, pointing out that the hotel, which is located on the noble Kurfürstendamm, is close to a synagogue.
The hotel quickly showed all the allegations of itself and called the incident an "accident" and "excused" at Lanzmann, reports Der Spiegel.
"There was never a direct instruction not to include Israel on the list of fast-track elections," a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel quoted the South German newspaper as saying.
It adds that the country prefix has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber shots against protesting Brazilian students
Students met with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to protest against government reforms for the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber shots against the protesters.
Difficulties began as police officers tried to discourage students, which led to the police employing rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their consternation about the plans.
According to Sao Paulo Governor Geraldo Alckmin’s proposals, less than 100 public schools will be closed, while 300,000 students will be deployed to save money.
Some of the protesters saw graffiti sprayed against interim president Michel Temer on the walls.
The recent protests took place a few days after mass protesters took to the streets to support the suspended president Dilma Rousseff, who had been suspended by a vote of the Senate on her resignation.
Trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71% - RT Business
With the lifting of sanctions, according to the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 percent in comparison to the year.
Since the lifting of international sanctions against Iran, the interest of Russian companies in business in the country has grown sharply, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are taking on existing connections with Iran, while new companies are ready to gain access to the market.
Of course, further trade expansion is one of the top priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that trade turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and was <0x24>856 million.
In particular, Russian imports to Iran jumped by 91.5 percent and amounted to <0x24>697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to <0x24>158 million.
The trade boom was achieved by deliveries of machinery, land vehicles and weapons,” the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan is set for this year with a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia.
Last year, the Russian foreign delegation issued around 35,000 visas, primarily travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, Iran reached the top 20 of the countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia.
One could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia from last year will be broken,” he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians are visiting Iran, something the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have kept the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Witness sought: Beverage market in Waldbröl attacked
A robbery was carried out on Thursday night at the Rewe XXL beverage market at Waldbröler Gerberstraße.
In the presence of a gun, three dark-dressed persons, who had hidden their faces, demanded the employee of the beverage market the release of cash and then fled on foot first and then probably with a silver-coloured VW golf.
How much money was earned, the police did not report.
The perpetrators are said to have been between 1.60 and 1.70 meters tall, so relatively small.
The beverage market is directly accessible from the park deck of the Rewe market and is poorly accessible.
After the attack, the perpetrators must have fled in the direction of Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and from the car park opposite the parking lot, possibly in the direction of B 256 (Schladernring).
Anyone who has made observations at the time (against 7:45 p.m.) related to the robbery should urgently contact the police.
Nagold: game and fun in summertime
Eight beautiful and happy days were spent by the children and young people of the social education day group/social group work of the Children’s Protection Federation Nagold with their caregivers on their summer vacation in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In the quiet recreational home Hardtwäldle, the lively group was located during the first school holiday week.
Several full-day excursions were on the program.
On the one hand, it went to Bretten with the visit of the Streichelzoo.
On the other hand, to Maulbronn, where there was a special children's guided tour in the world-famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
In the Celtic Museum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about the everyday life and food of the Celts.
On the hot days, the group enjoyed the lake in Maulbronn, which invites you to jump, swim and board.
Culinary children and caregivers were served with their own prepared body meals such as the Sauren Spätzle, the Seebrunnen Pfännle, the Iselshauser-Bloff, the English breakfast and the Tubinger Bolognese.
In workshops were baked, beautiful jewelry made of pearls and stones or made of wood a Roman mill game.
Other highlights of the leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond, the evenings on the fire and the final "Bunte Evening".
On the day of the journey home the sun laughed and the children and young people returned home satisfied.
Haigerholch: Pilgrims to the Gate of Mercy
The ministers from the Eyachtal-Hagerloch St. Anna were on the way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Together, four stages were completed.
In order to bridge the time until the next Rome Wall trip of all ministers in an estimated two years, the St. Anna’s Round of Prime Ministers has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.
Various wall trip destinations were checked and finally decided for the Bishops’ city of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage was offered with the gate of Mercy at Freiburg Münster.
16 Ministries from prayer-bronze, gruol, hail-hole and halls set out on the way.
The evening before, the priest Storost sent the pilgrims out in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim cross and granted the pilgrim blessing.
From Horb, a train was taken to the starting point of Villingen, where a Münster of Our Lady stands, and the pilgrimage was started from the Münster.
The individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening by a short impulse each with various prayers, songs and lyrics.
But even on the road, the ministers at field crosses, chapels or churches repeatedly rested to sing together a song from a specially compiled pilgrim songbook.
For the overnight stays, parish houses of the local parishes were available.
At the stage goals, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty as well as strengthening dinner and breakfast.
On the second day we went over Furtwangen to Güterbach.
After that, the stage was reached to St. Peter, which was the most difficult route, but when the heat was hot, it was necessary to descend about 500 meters above sea level and then climb again.
The deserved reward was a shared barbecue at the bathing lodge in the evening.
After the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, it went to the final stage to Freiburg.
Visibly relieved and happy, the minis met at the Freiburger Münster later in the afternoon and passed through the gates of mercy.
With a little impulse, God was thanked.
At the evening fair in Münster, the minis arrived at the pilgrimage destination by co-operator Markus Obert.
After worship, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the altar.
The next day it was time for the Breisgaumetropole.
In the afternoon, we returned to Horb by train.
In the end, all the participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong community experience.
Scottish Callum Skinner Storms Home as Brite Gets Gold for Cycling
Scotland's Callum Skinner rallied to fame last night in the men's team sprint at the Velodrom in Rio when the British team defended the London 2012 title.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took on the anchor role that his countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made of himself. The little boy made the legend proud when he stormed home to capture a victory from New Zealand's favorites.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.
They repeated the trick after winning only a modest sixth place at the London Rail World Championships in March, despite Hoys’ resignation.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of driver Jamie Staff.
They did this in time as a hindsight.
Today's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the Scotland that has now unfolded.
Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
Hindes was back shortly after his round, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.
A change of strategy was a big part of the transformation, with Hindes driving in a higher gear to slow him down, allowing Kenny and Skinner especially to keep pace.
Today looked out of his position as a BBC expert and fell Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they climbed to the podium.
The 23-year-old skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a sluggish comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final round and defeated the world champions.
It was just unbelievable.
There is no better way to win this.
After the 2012 triumph on the side of Kenny and Hoys, Hindes admitted that after a weak start he fell on the track intentionally.
He withdrew this statement later and there was no objection from England's rivals.
With such an overwhelming victory, there was no such problem this time.
Hindes said, "It feels like London with all the GB flags on the stands."
We have been together as a team for the last three months.
We have gone so bad with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of our progress over the past five months, we expect successful five days in the velodrome.
With the form of Kenny, it is possible that he repeats Hoys victory of three Olympic gold medals in one competition.
That would mean for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (an apparently sacred date for British sport; on that day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were also born) - a profit of six gold medals and a silver medal.
It's coming from today.
Kenny next takes part in the sprint, which starts today and will go in three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I'm enjoying this only for the moment."
The team event is always the best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels a little lonely to win alone.
He said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten as a knight."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified for the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race.
They reached the target in 3:51,942.
The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was 3:51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will certainly be in the focus.
Yesterday, he had a fight with officials before qualifying, when officials called him to measure his body size.
Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in a world record time of 4:13,260.
The GB team relies on its strong track team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a bunch of medals.
After a truly extraordinary display of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio were declining.
Dramas played out in the background, including the resignation of technical leader Shane Sutton in April amid allegations of sexism and bullying, as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, when you look at the first night of the competition in Velodrom, it looks like the now legendary reputation of GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated.
The future of Portland’s melting due to the cancellation of the energy contract in question
The future of Portland aluminum melt in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - is at stake as the plant operator cancels the energy supply contract and will therefore cancel all supply contracts, as the supplying energy company said.
This was followed by the government’s decision in Victoria earlier this year not to grant further subsidies for the operation of the facility.
A grant set for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs at the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.
No less than 2,000 jobs, either directly or indirectly, could be at risk of closure.
In addition, there could be domino effects as the melting industry consumes about 10 percent of Victoria’s total electricity generation.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry melting plant, leading to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
The Alcoa melting plant in Portland is losing money and risking a closure.
This step follows years of speculation about the future of the plant, initially as a result of the strong Australian dollar, and lastly because of the electricity price for the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminum melting plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it is expected that three other owners will terminate their contracts.
The plant is in majority ownership of a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means a further physical demand for electricity from the melting plant," the company said.
AGL further stated that the contracts were so-called "securities transactions" that were supposed to enter into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month termination period, so they will end in 2017.
"Therefore, AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenue in fiscal year 17," said the electricity supplier.
All potential impacts on AGL revenues from GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL noted that it had already depreciated the value of the contracts in its <0x24>187 million annual settlement in “expecting a termination”.
Alcoa said that the decision to break out the contracts, the "ability of Alcoas... to operate the melting plant or to ensure the power supply to the melting plant" did not affect.
The U.S. company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which should have entered into force from November this year, even though it is still due to explain why it has withdrawn from the contract.
Analysts warn against the possible closure of the Portland melting plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the industry’s poor economic conditions.
Speaking to analysts earlier this week, Chief of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes about 600 megawatts per year and Tomago consumes about 900 megawatts of electricity.
If both facilities disappeared from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [electric market].
And for us as generators, that would not be good,” he said.
More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September edition of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner clan Kris is on the cover of the coveted September edition of the US Vogue.
Kendall, the brand ambassador for Estee Lauder and running at Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to tears," Kendall wrote.
The reveal of the cover followed a bizarre (or just Keeping Up with the Kardashians similar?), scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of Rob and Caitlyn’s problem cases), and in the presence of Weaverestern, they ended up with one of the most popular shows of their kind and upbringing.
This represents the cliché-like action of almost every birthday episode of a children's broadcast (Seacrest brought the sentence, "Did you think we forgot you?"), with the honesty of a cartoon queen on a show at 8 a.m.), but Kris had to take her other girls to this one somehow.
With regard to the September edition of Vogue, a new era of Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall’s older sister Kim likes to have beat the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were watching it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself.
The September edition is the best-selling edition of the year for Vogue.
With a scope that resembles an image tape rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (according to Fashionista were of the 832 pages of the roller 615 pages of advertising).
The disclosure of his coverstar is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years, the magazine’s images have been blurred even before the official announcement.
Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have clearly been more "family models" than "family models" on the cover.
Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga was honored.
But even with the slight chance that Mrs. Jenner - described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the previous category, she is in good company.
These celebrities are not related to celebrities or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to shoot a good snapchat video (even if it all applies to Jenner).
They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, Jenner’s success doesn’t appeal to everyone.
With her reality TV story, Jenner’s position in the fashion world has always been somewhat tense.
In June, former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized her and called her "the mischiefs of the moment."
These feelings boiled up again when the news of Jenner’s appearance on the Vogue Cover came out.
But it seems to pass the point on the mischief.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of Vogue.
It is, in the true sense of the word, a supermodel.
She runs for Marc Jacobs.
She advertises for your foundation of Estee Lauder.
They and all their sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective Paywall apps.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time she's seen on reality TV, probably just to see her sister Kourtney and their children.
Municipal law centres dismiss 160,000 people annually
More than 160,000 of the country’s most in need are rejected annually by municipal law centres, while the industry is focusing on the impact of further cuts in funds on already overburdened transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people — mostly elderly people, immigrants, needy workers, victims of violence, and those who do not have funds for unfair deployments and the like — are rejected in their requests for free legal advice and legal assistance.
The community’s legal services, which are already overloaded, are preparing for further cuts.
As of June next year, these centers are expected to lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Municipal Rights Centres, said the latest survey of the National Association of Municipal Rights Centres found that thousands of people are already being rejected each year.
Farrell said the situation would only get worse without a repeal of the federal government’s decision.
"Queensland's community law centers are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people will be denied the essential services you need," he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with overwhelming and oppressive debts, families that go through separations, workers who have been unjustly fired – all these people have problems of a legal nature, and this survey shows that they can’t get the help they need.
As of June 2017, the federal government will cut funding by 30 percent, which means that thousands of healthier people from Queensland will be forced to deal with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the Federal Attorney General and Federal Justice Minister and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately lift these cuts so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of municipal law centres and their customer communities and that the government of Palaszczuk is investing in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign accused after employee allegedly pulled a gun
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign has been charged with alleged inactivity after she was informed that her campaign leader for North Carolina targeted a gun on an employee while they were on a jeep in February.
The incident is described in an indictment filed Wednesday in Charlotte County Court by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in this state.
Bordini said he had waited months for the matter to be settled internally before realizing that "it wouldn't happen."
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "draw a pistol, put his right finger on the detachment, and hit the run in Vincent's knee," Bordini said in his accusation.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign leadership, Bordini noted that at least four other people had already had the same experience with Phillip, he said in the indictment.
"Weapons do not need to be fired to cause damage," Bordini said.
The charge comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate sparked a riot when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment People" - gun owners and gun friends - should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton becomes rivals.
Trump’s campaign made it clear that the media had pulled his words out of context and that he would not push for violence.
Bordini’s complaint demands compensation from the campaign for the violation of the duty of care and from Philip for bodily injury and sustained soul damages.
Trump’s spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, was unable to reach an opinion.
Attempts to contact Philip failed as well.
WCCB, a local news broadcaster in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer a campaign employee.
Calls from his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, were not responded.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has conducted a controversial campaign so far.
The proceeding is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Sweden: Poll before country elections: SPD and CDU lose
In the upcoming elections in the states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September), significant losses for the SPD and CDU government parties.
This was the result of representative surveys by the opinion research institute INSA for the "Image" newspaper (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition in the north could barely continue to govern, this is not possible, according to the polls in Berlin.
In both states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and thus have good chances of continuing to appoint the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD fell from 35.6% five years ago to 24%.
According to the poll, the party is just ahead of the CDU, which could return to 23 percent.
The third place is disputed between the left and the AfD.
The left is 19 per cent (previously 18.4 per cent), while the AfD would be represented with 19 per cent for the first time in the country’s parliament.
The Greens, despite slight losses of 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent), are returning to the Schwerin Landtag.
NPD and FDP would not be represented in the country's parliament with 3% each.
According to the poll, in the Berlin House elections, the SPD is only 23 percent (2011 election: 28.3 percent).
The CDU only reached 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
It is still behind the greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but ahead of the left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented in the House for the first time with 14 percent.
With 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, but pirates would miss the entry as opposed to 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
E-mail and Internet in Time: 20 years ago, the Nokia Communicator came on the market.
The successors now dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and larger, so it was not well in the hand either.
On the contrary, it was pretty clumsy.
The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which would now be enough for about two high-resolution selfies.
An iPhone is currently being delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came into stores exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996 - and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they are somehow from the stone age of the Internet age.
Twenty years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hannover as "Office in the Western Pocket Format".
In fact, the new mobile phone was able to reach a lot of standards at the time: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax was the communicator.
Even access to web pages was possible via HTML browsers, though painfully slow.
A pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the phone could be folded up similar to a laptop.
Then a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen were found.
Pretty proud was the price: 2700 D-Mark, that is about 1400 euros.
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany in 2015 was 392 euros.
In August 1996, no one could imagine that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.
Since then, everything has been different.
The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.
The Finns’ mobile sector experienced an unprecedented disaster, was eventually sold to Microsoft and settled.
Today, the market is dominated by suppliers, all of whom came much later than Nokia.
To be online always and everywhere, this is today for a lot of people everyday.
In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.
Approximately 1.4 billion devices have been sold to Samsung and Apple, of which only 555 million are missing.
Worldwide sales of the equipment amount to around 400 billion euros.
This includes the well-run business of countless app providers and telecommunications companies.
Around the smartphone, an entire industry has now emerged.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only in early 2007, when Apple CEO Steve Jobs on the Mac World announced the introduction of the iPhone.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone, and an Internet communicator, to operate everything easily via a touch screen.
Apple’s win started, and today, the iPhone is the most important product of the group.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who dominated the market, were looking forward to it.
They finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
That’s what Apple and Asian companies like Samsung have to say.
Twenty years after its invention, the smartphone is a matter of course.
On average, every German now looks at his phone 88 times a day.
"We all have to learn to put the smartphone away," said Janina Kugel, chairman of the Siemens staff.
Permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and a blessing at the same time.
England must lead the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local municipalities and throughout London, but throughout the country.
For me, it was Heathrow’s biggest attraction, just like in 2012 in London, when we made a big effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympics brought great advantages to Stratford and the East End.
And this will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for locals and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will already create 10,000 new teaching jobs, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.
As they predicted in London in 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of Heathrow’s enlargement is too big.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be blaming ourselves on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question he is asked.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many and not for individuals.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, create <0xC2><0xA3>211 billion in remarkable growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment around the airport as well as throughout the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow that has implemented a <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from the T5, which for five years in a row was chosen as the world’s best airport terminal, to the T2, which was built amidst the two most frequent running ladders in the world.
Now they are ready to deliver a third step, which is supported by <0xC2><0xA3>16 billion in private investment.
The 2012 London Games were a huge success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.
It is time for us to lead this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, while securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment on which England can be proud.
Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "cat and mouse game" about ad blocking
For companies that make money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers, attempts to avoid ad blocking are similar to a "cat and mouse game".
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad blocks on its desktop page, Adblock Plus posted a blog post announcing that users could update their filters in the program to again block ads on the social network.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the encoding of its ads to make it harder for ad blockers to recognize which part of the page is ads.
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that “this kind of fight between the ad-blocking Open Source community and the surroundings is already underway since the invention of ad blockers,” and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how worrying the industry has become advertising blockers.
According to a recent study by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people worldwide use ad blockers, almost four times that in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook’s advertising revenue.
The company has opted out of ad blockers on desktop PCs as mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook’s mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a spokesman said.
Advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a large enough share of revenue, so Facebook appears to be worth investing in such a step.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its “ad preference tool” to give people more control over targeted advertising.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock’s new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the page that is not advertising.
“This is not a positive experience for users, so we plan to address the problem,” a Facebook spokesman said in an email.
Ad blockers are a dumb tool, which is why we have instead focused on developer tools such as Ad Preferences to put more control into people’s hands.
Woman crosses Swiss highway in case of suspected suicide
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are calling witnesses after a woman was overtaken early in the morning on Thursday in a suspected suicide by several vehicles on a highway.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Waadt shortly after midnight.
A woman lay on the street in the dark "in an act of despair" and was hit by several cars, police said in Waadt.
It is obvious that a 49-year-old Swiss woman, who was overtaken by several vehicles, including a truck, tried to kill herself.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been detained, but some have still not been identified, police said, urging them and any witnesses to report the incident.
An investigation procedure was opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter told the Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be expected if one of the drivers will be shown.
Was a collision avoidable?
That’s something the prosecutor must decide,” Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not being held accountable.
In each of the two cases - in which a person walked on the highway in the dark - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian runs on the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper said.
Last year, a policewoman was released after she overtook and killed a man who was lying on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and became unconscious on the street, the court said.
The court found that the policewoman — who had responded to an emergency call — was driving in a justified manner and that the presence of a man on the street was a “completely extraordinary and unpredictable situation,” the judge said.
Anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA Climate Model: Venus Was Once Inhabitable
The Venus was probably once habitable, according to projections of a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere, could have once exhibited Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and still slowly moved forward.
The model also illuminated the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably had more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and protected against rapid evaporation.
The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposes its sun's day-side for almost two months," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio said in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like a umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heat.
The result is average temperatures that are some degree cooler than the Earth today.
The model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution previously suspected by planetary scientists.
Although it was once probably habitable, Venus — over the course of several billion years — was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.
When hydrogen was developed, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide was left with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy Resigns as Avalanche Coach
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday as coach and vice president of Colorado Avalanche Operations and led a little co-determination in the team's decision-making process.
Vice President/General Manager of Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the club will immediately look for a new coach.
“For the past three years, I have been serving as head coach and vice president of Colorado Avalanche Operations with energy, passion and determination,” Roy, 50, said in a statement.
Over the course of the summer, I have long and thought a lot about how I could improve this team to give it more depth, it takes it and bring it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey operations must be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.
He must also have a right of co-determination for decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are not currently met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick informed me today about this decision," Sakic said.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future.
During his debut season at the 2013-14 Avalanches, Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the best coach in the league.
He led the club to 112 points and first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Minnesota playoffs and missed the postseason in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches scored a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season and dropped behind the wild for a second wildcard spot in the Western Conference by five points.
As Hall of Fame Torwart, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, set off strike
Work struggles regarding compensation for North Sea oil workers will be suspended, as all parties to the dispute sit on the table for a new round of talks, the negotiating leaders said.
Strikes against oil field service provider Wood Group were sporadic on North Sea platforms operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group, as well as the Unite and RMT trade unions, can confirm that we have agreed to restart the settlement process of the current dispute," it said in a joint statement.
We will hold a few full-day sessions in the coming weeks, which will start early next year in order to tackle the problems again.
The unions said their last strike, the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
This year, Wood Group cut rates for its North Sea contractors by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure.
The company’s rate cut follows a 10 percent decline for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional cuts give the company the space it needs to get through the market swing.
For its part, Shell has fired thousands of people and announced plans to quit its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlined its operations as a result of its mega merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to the lower crude prices, an economic situation that had been heightened by the British decision in June to leave the European Union.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with workers’ leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that have been taking place in the North Sea for a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
“In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few,” he said in a statement.
In 2016, spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected to be less than <0x24>1.4 billion compared to an average of around <0x24>7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler Measures Rotation Rate of Stars in the Pleiades
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates under the stars of the Pleiades.
The new data will help astronomers understand why stars in the cluster rotate at different rates and what the rotational periods are related to planetary formation.
“We hope to learn more about the relationship between a star’s mass, its age, and even the history of its solar system by comparing our results with other clusters of stars,” said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech’s Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena.
The stellar cluster of the Pleiades is 445 light-years away from Earth.
Many stars in this cluster, which formed about 125 million years ago, are now reaching adulthood.
They are now turning fastest.
At peak rotational rates, these mature stars produce large amounts of stellar winds.
As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a slowing effect on the stars.
As a star agees, its rotation rate begins to slow.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by detecting the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot—such as sunspots.
The latest catalogue of rotational rates indicates that massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to dancers, with larger stars rotating slower pyrouettes than smaller ones.
"In the 'ballet' of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotors tend to be massive, while faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.
Since the stellar cluster of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotational rates.
"The stellar cluster of the Pleiades provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
There’s still a lot ahead of us that we’d like to learn more about, how, when and why stars slow down their rotational speeds and hang their dance shoes.
Rebull and her colleagues have detailed in three newspaper reports their latest analysis of the rotational rates of the Pleiades, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
A Controversial Baseball Star Resigns
Alex Rodriguez’s tears ran faster than the US baseball star on best days from base to base.
After his emotional resignation announcement, the 41-year-old professional will be wearing his New York Yankees’ shirt for the last time against the Tampa Bay Rays on August 12.
“I love this game and this team.”
"I say 'goodbye' to both of them," said the 14-time All-Star Game participant of the Major League Baseball (MLB).
Rodriguez was selected three times as the most valuable player in the league, and in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.
His signature under a ten-year contract has donated him <0x24>27 million annually since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on December 31, 2017, he will serve as a consultant and youth coach – at full salary.
As a player, Rodriguez paid back for a long time with performance.
With 696 homeruns, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004), and since 2005 for the Yankees, he made some milestones.
With Hall of Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players have similar values in the main statistics.
However, the 41-year-old should not be admitted to the Hall of Fame of Baseball.
Because so successful Rodriguez - nickname "A-Rod" - was on the field, so his appearance outside the square is controversial.
Already in 2009, the superstar admitted to having taken banned steroids between 2001 and 2003 at ESPN.
In August 2013, he was suspended for 211 matches in the so-called biogenesis scandal until the end of 2014.
Rodriguez is believed to have been the main suspect for years in an anti-aging clinic in southern Florida.
After a legal dispute, the barrier was reduced to 162 more matches.
"The league could have even done me a favor for 2014, because I played for 20 years without a break," Rodriguez said.
Even his farewell days did not go quietly.
While many baseball legends in their last games once again got to the big stage, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.
"My job doesn't include a farewell tour."
"My job involves trying to win every game," Yankees coach Joe Girardi said.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to actress Cameron Diaz and is said to have been in a relationship with pop star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, received sympathy from the fans of the Boston Red Sox Yankee rivals.
"We want A-Rod," the fans sang in the 4:9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.
Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are the first doping cases
Captured: Due to a positive doping test, weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland is not allowed to start in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympics are overshadowing the first official doping cases.
A well-established athlete would have almost won a medal.
Before the seventh day of the competition, the first official doping cases became known at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter obstacle runner Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski have been tested positive and excluded in Brazil - just before the start of the critically acclaimed athletics competition.
Chen had already tested the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances on Sunday.
On Friday afternoon, the International Court of Sport confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old finished fourth in the final over 100 m butterfly, with only 0.09 seconds missing the bronze medal.
On Friday, Chen was expected to take part in the freestyle runs over 50 m.
Chen has asked the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for the opening of the B-test and a hearing.
The national association takes the matter “very seriously and requires Chen to fully cooperate with the investigations,” Xinhua quoted from a statement: “We will cooperate with the International Sports Court of Cas and will accept the verdict.”
For the first time in history, the IOC is no longer responsible for sanctioning athletes with positive cases.
Also on the night of Rio, the news of Danekowa's positive test went through, the 33-year-old went into the offensive himself.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," this was "an incredible shock," she told Bulgarian TV broadcaster BNT.
She is innocent, "the only explanation could be dietary supplements," she explained.
According to the report, the banned substance is the blood doping agent EPO.
Danekowa has been suspended, according to BNT, the B-probe has already been positive.
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bojko Borissov immediately spoke with criticism of the athlete.
"I don't understand why athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said, "we Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."
For example, not all weightlifters from the chronically doping-laden nation are allowed to participate in Rio.
On Friday, the case of "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London Olympic winner in the class up to 85 kg was tested positive for the anabolic steroid Nandrolone like his brother Tomasz three days earlier.
Both contest the intake, however, both may not start in the class up to 94 kg.
Before the start of athletics, especially the Danekowa case is another heavy blow to the reputation of the entire sport.
The World Federation of IAAF had banned the launch of the entire Russian team until an exception due to systematic doping, and the runner nation Kenya also produces numerous bad news in Rio.
In swimming, the previous crimes in China had also resulted in violent clashes between the athletes.
French champion Camille Lacourt attacked Chinese Olympic winner Sun Yang.
"Sun Yang pinked for long."
"When I see the podium over 200 m freestyle, I want to surrender," Lacourt told French radio.
Sun also stood at the center of a confrontation with Australian Mack Horton.
“I have no time and no respect for doping scammers,” he said.
Sun was tested positive for the stimulant trimetazidine at the 2014 Chinese championships, but only had to sit a three-month lock.
Data Clause: How perfidious hackers extort their ransom money
Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in doing so.
According to a recent survey of malware defense specialists, Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, the UK and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed have been victims of at least once, in part several times, an attack with extortion software over the past twelve months.
In Germany, nearly 20 percent of companies have already been targeted for ransomware oppression.
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransom money requested by the perpetrators to be able to reuse the attacked systems and data.
The perpetrators specialize in their extortion software, according to Malwarebytes’ observations regarding attacks on corporate networks.
If they are successful there, the ransom money potentially to be blackmailed will be considerably higher than for private users.
"We are currently observing a terrifyingly fast evolution of malware," Malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski told The World.
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertising.
Then the perpetrators discovered extortion software for themselves.
At first, private users were the target, but the shift to corporate attacks took place horribly quickly in the past months.
Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: Once active on a victim’s computer, it searches targeted for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or database files, as well as archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the ransomware and permanently delete the original.
The software then presents the demands of the predators.
In order to get the final encryption code to the files, victims need to transfer money – mostly in the form of cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
However, where the personal photo database is at stake for private users, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production is stopped.
Accordingly, the damage is higher when a ransomware attacks.
22 percent of affected German companies reported revenue losses due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely discontinue business, in one case people were at risk of life.
In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks, whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of hospital records.
“We always tell the victims: don’t pay, you only promote the problem,” Kleczynski explains.
However, 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay get their data back.
It is difficult for managers to reject the claim of the perpetrators given the stagnation in operation.
The hackers, in turn, know this and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, F-Secure security researchers have investigated the user interfaces and contact with the blackmailers and come to the conclusion that the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to get more money.
They explain to their victims via chat how they can pay via Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites, or decrypt sample files for free.
And if private individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies must partly trade hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted.
Given the potentially high and relatively risk-free profits from the ransomware oppression, hackers are becoming more and more professional and share the work, security expert Chester Wisniewski from antivirus provider Sophos explains: “A single person can write a ransomware about within a week.”
However, it is more likely that these are three or four people.
The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software builder to the actual blackmailers.
The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware itself, advice and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price of between <0x24>1,000 and <0x24>10,000.
"Included in the delivery is a customization tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The blackmailers then search for other hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So you log into one of the underground forums, buy the set from a criminal and order another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
Payment is made per infected computer.
"Usually the criminals then commission spammers with the spread," explains Wisniewski.
The risk of ransomware is now known to many companies that better secure their data.
More than 50 percent of company IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust to be able to prevent ransomware through file backups and scanner software.
Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
“If encryption alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful exploration, the perpetrators are instead threatening to release sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations,” said Marcin Kleczynski, chief executive of Malwarebytes.
As a result, the damage potential is even higher than before, depending on the type of data.
Also, the perpetrators could in the future take on completely new targets on the Internet of Things.
At the Defcon Hacker Conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.
In the middle of winter, the release of such blocked heating could be worth a ransom for some victims.
If the perpetrators block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and everyday
In the small HR-V, Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and even the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds pretty overloaded, but the HR-V, built on the same new platform as the new jazz, proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V seems rather small, the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the bottom, it does not seem tight anywhere.
The materials of the interior are well processed and look pleasant, only the cockpit top drops a bit.
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in the warehouse.
Not only is there a 453 l luggage compartment available for high-rise and 1026 l for folded backrests, but there are the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: the rear seat areas can be folded up like cinema chairs and thus provide storage space, which is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.
The trunk can be loaded well, but the loading height at 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6-l diesel with 88 kW/120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.
He should do his job a little quieter.
The daily consumption of 4.7 l/100 km is satisfactory.
There is another engine: a 1.5-l petrol with 96 kW/130 hp.
All-wheel drive is not offered.
The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
The steering should be a little more direct.
The equipment does not reveal any wishes in the tested top version "Executive".
The safety systems include the City Emergency Brake Assist (works up to Tempo 32), the collision warning system and the track stop assistant.
The collision warning sometimes irritates because it ranks many obstacles as "accessible objects."
The remote lighting assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent timer responds to traffic signal recognition and speeds when needed.
But the full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touch screen, Navi, app integration and more.
Two USB and one HDMI sockets are under the armrest and are therefore somewhat inconvenient to achieve.
The around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>29,000 for the well-equipped top diesel is fine.
If you don’t want to invest that much, you get the gasoline from 20,000 euros, the diesel from 23000 euros.
The engines meet the Euro-6 exhaust gas standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline fails to hold: crash on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the crash of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
For liability is only conceivable in the case of hazards typical of air traffic, argued the Supreme Court of Düsseldorf (Az.: 18 U 124/14).
The plaintiff had broken a knee slit in the fall.
However, the accident could have happened anywhere – it is a general life risk, the court said.
The airline did not have to pay the man any damages.
Case of illness: when the organizer pays
Sick vacationers will only receive money back after their trip if the cause of the disease is undoubtedly found in the hotel.
However, this is only the case if more than 10 percent of the guests have the same symptoms.
In the negotiated case, a family was severely ill from diarrhea and vomiting on the second day of their Turkish holiday.
She spent almost the whole holiday in the room.
Their illness led the holidaymakers back to a defective clarification facility that allegedly contaminated seawater.
The family was of the opinion that the trip was defective – and complained against the organizer.
In court, the plaintiffs were unsuccessful.
In fact, the clearing system was defective.
However, the organizer did not know about it until shortly before the complainant left.
He had to assume until then that the sea water was in order.
He did not violate his information obligations, according to the verdict.
In particular, no contaminants were found in the samples of the water.
The disease of several hotel guests - possibly by contagion with each other - is a common life risk.
Of the 691 guests, only 38 were ill.
De Maizière said that after the violence in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were concerned about further attacks.
The state must be isolated and at the same time decisively react to terrorist threats.
Our country will not respond to the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We will not give this victory to the terrorists.
However, if criminals had to leave the country faster, this would increase security and also strengthen the people’s approval of refugee policy.
De Maizière wants to implement the proposals by the end of the 2017 Bundestag election.
He also announced a further personnel reinforcement of the security forces, namely "in an average four-seater order over several years".
Advertising sympathy for terrorism must be punished again.
Video surveillance is aimed at improving the right to arms in such a way as to make it more difficult to buy weapons on the Internet.
The last much-discussed duty of silence for doctors is to be maintained according to the words of Maizière.
However, he wants to find solutions in the dialogue with the medical community to reduce the threat to citizens, he said with a view to, for example, psychological incidences.
In order to counter the radicalisation of refugees, the Minister considers that better social care is necessary.
Teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traumatized people.
To prosecute criminals in specific areas of the Internet (Darknet), de Maizière plans to use hidden investigators.
SPD chief Gabriel said: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increase security."
It is important that the Minister of the Interior has clearly spoken out against actionism.
"This was a blowjob for the sharpeners in the CDU/CSU," Gabriel told the newspapers of the Funke media group.
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the Union following a Burka ban and the abolition of dual citizenship.
He considers a general prohibition of full disguise to be constitutionally problematic.
You can't ban everything you refuse, and I refuse to wear the burka.
You can talk about rules, for example, in road traffic or for witnesses in court.
Green Chief Simone Peter accused the minister of trying to simulate action and action with ever-new anti-terror packages.
Left party chief Bernd Riexinger said: "Flotte proverbs and a tightening of the right of residence do not bring any more security to the people of this country."
Improved traffic flow on the highway conveyor
It is regularly standing on the surrounding road - here is a picture of November.
But this is going to change: the right-wing path is going to be extended.
This is good news for all car drivers who are in traffic on the surrounding road every evening when they drive over the highway (A 43).
The state-owned road construction company will extend the right-sabbiegers track by 700 meters on Tuesday and Wednesday (16/17 August) in the area between Hammer Straße and Weseler Straße exit.
Drivers can then thread directly from Hammer Street to the right.
The big advantage: traffic is divided more early, which improves the overall flow on the long-distance section of Bundesstraße 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district represented Münster-West.
The road blockade on the supplyer annoys the drivers especially between 5 and 7 p.m.
During the working day, the retreat to the bridge over the Albersloher path and sometimes beyond.
The reason is the needle lamp on the B 51 just before the departure of Weseler Straße.
From here, traffic will only be driven one-way across the highway bridge.
The second track had to be rebuilt four years ago.
The reason: Static calculations had resulted in the bridge no longer possessing the necessary load-bearing force to absorb heavy load traffic in a two-track manner.
How long will this engpass and the work-day stalling associated with it last, cannot be said by the competent national operation.
However, years are to be expected: because the bridge has an official residual use period until 2034.
For the extension of the legal sabbies track, the state government has deliberately chosen the less traffic time in the school holidays because disabilities are to be expected.
Traffic will pass on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site.
Intercultural travel: cultural offers for schools
The international class of the Forest School visited the play "The Invisible House".
The Nima's and the Young Theater are now planning a music project.
The Nima's Association allows young people with migration and refugee backgrounds to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Klasse International" of the Forest School Kinderhaus has visited an idea of the award-winning play "The Invisible House" of the Young Theater Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Journey" initiated by the Nima Association, 19 students between the ages of 11 and 15 attended the stage in the Small House.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has focused on the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee backgrounds, offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project.
Most of the class’s youth came to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria, and speak little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, the scenic images and video animations, it was still possible for them to follow the course of the action, according to the press release of the Young Theater Münster.
The association Nima’s, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Speakel, and the Young Theater will work together in the upcoming play season as part of a music theater project.
From October to December, young people with or without a background in refugees and migration between the ages of 14 and 20 will be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing, dancing, acting and music.
Offers for children and families in the theater play and theatrical language media are in the planning.
The project "Intercultural Journey" continues.
Given the increasing number of refugees, the association expects many classes to participate.
Rain instead of Starbucks: Hope for Weather Improvement
The weather has made the star-snooker in southwestern Germany a slap in the face on Friday night - but there is still hope.
The night had been poorly suited for observing the skyscraper due to clouds and rain, said Hans-Ulrich Keller, chairman of the Welzheim Observatory, on Friday morning.
Our hope is on the night of Saturday.
The weather is supposed to be good, then we will definitely see a lot of stars in the sky.
The constellations are Persians, which are among the fastest constellations at 216,000 kilometres per hour.
They have their name because they appear to come from the constellation Perseus, which rises in the northeast.
Relaxing Night: Tips for Sleep Disorders
In the evening you roll around forever, in the night you wake up for hours, in the morning you can no longer think of sleep before the alarm clock.
It's all but refreshing.
After all, you are in good company with such problems: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep is often or permanently unreasonable.
How do sleep problems or sleep disturbances occur?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and they can be caused by a variety of causes, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, a board member of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
What is commonly understood is insomnia, that is, an insomnia disorder.
In fact, many people feel that sleep is either unsatisfactory or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, a board member of the German Association of Physicians with practice in Lower Saxony Varel.
What is behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
Behind them can be organic, psychological or behavioral factors, but also medications.
Not rarely, sleep disorder is an expression of another disease.
“Very early awakening is especially common in depression,” says Weeß.
And it can be that different factors condition each other.
For example, if you have a tape disc accident, you may feel bad, wake up every two to three hours, and maybe start to worry about everyday problems and concerns, Weeß gives an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should I go to the doctor with sleep disorders?
If you do not sleep well for at least three nights a week over a period of one month and are impaired during the day, you should go to the doctor, advises Weeß.
The disability can look quite different: one is depressed, tired, not asleep, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical discomfort such as stomach or headaches.
To alleviate sleep disorders, it is important to find out their causes.
Treatment options include behavioral changes, cognitive behavioral therapy or medications – classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and for a maximum of two weeks.
There are hardly any low-income sleep physicians in Germany, stresses Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the Interdisciplinary Sleep Medicine Centre of the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.
Therefore, if you have problems with sleep, you should first consult your doctor, advises Weeß.
It can clarify with examinations whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the sleep lab, and what happens?
For examination in the sleep lab, doctors advise, for example, in snoring with athema transplants, in sick daytime fatigue, in sleepwalkers, or if the cause of a breakthrough disorder is not found, Fietze explains.
You don’t really have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normally.
"Just please don't sleep at noon," says Fietze.
After wiring, you go to bed at your normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, you wear a nose glasses, a chest belt and a sensor on the finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleeping person.
How can people who are affected deal with the problems?
There are quite a lot of adjustment screws on which you can set up for a better sleep.
Weeß counts on: Regular sleep and waking times, not too long in bed, not sleeping during the day, not watching TV to fall asleep, avoid alcohol and not watch the clock at night - then you start to count immediately, and that is not at all beneficial.
What the Jungle Camp has to do with missing medals in swimming
Former German swimmer Markus Deibler has made a statement on Facebook about the disappointing cut off of the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014, he won gold at the Doha Short Track World Championships for the first time and set his first world record.
Former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has now defended himself via Facebook from his criticised ex-team colleagues.
“In a country where an Olympic winner is awarded 20,000 euros and a jungle king <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150,000, no one should wonder about missing medals,” the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night.
The support system in swimming sports is bad, but doping controls are very good.
This means that we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look so closely at or even operate on the subject of doping.
“I’m not saying that the controls should be stopped here,” he said.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler had to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
This is exactly what you should do with countries as well.
"Anyone who can't be controlled for a certain time before the World Cup/OS by independent WADA/FINA controllers can't participate," the election hamburger, who currently runs an ice rink, said in a statement.
Airport: Bands of Luggage Thieves Arrested
Professional Thieves at Düsseldorf Airport
On Thursday, the Düsseldorf police arrested two women and two men aged between 50 and 61.
The suspects had committed several baggage and baggage thefts as a gang.
By 9:30 p.m., civilian officials in the Düsseldorf airport area recognized a gang known to the police for past theft crimes.
The two women and two men had committed several crimes since mid-July of this year, and had done so collectively, in a work-sharing and in a particularly professional manner.
The specialists of the Criminal Commissariat 34 can prove four acts to the thieves who had entered Germany specifically for the commission of crimes.
They had earned a total of over <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15,000.
Altbauten, a few Lindenbaums, in the meantime, another remnant of headstones: Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not look like this at first glance, but the police are among the "dangerous places" of the city.
If you walk along the street from east to west, you will find playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a bio shop.
On the facade of a grey house someone has sprayed "wrong!"
In front of a Lidl, which will soon be demolished, is already being built: by 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be built here.
However, articles about this "trending district", as the responsible real estate firm Friedrichshain calls, are preferably depicted in recent weeks with burning cars.
The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, now the residents have lease agreements, but on the ground floor are still occupied rooms and are used for events.
In particular, Berlin Interior Senator Henkel had repeatedly expressed his support for a police strenuous action against the project since the beginning of the year, calling the area a "no-go zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.
After the rooms on the ground floor on June 22 were cleared, with 300 police officers, the police patrolled for three weeks with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on the spot, blocked parts of the street, and stopped the doorway with the driver.
Meanwhile, construction workers renovated the premises on behalf of the unknown house owners.
On July 13, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the clearing had been illegal, and a day later the police and construction workers withdrew under the humiliation of sympathizers and residents.
On this summer afternoon the street works peacefully: parents go for a walk with children, people are sitting on the street in front of the houses in the sun, others are entertaining in front of late.
There is a primary school and kindergarten in close proximity to the house projects.
Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in Kiez since 1999, and Jana*, who is raising three children here, are particularly excited by the police presence.
With the residents of the house projects, they share the concern about rising rents and gentrification.
It doesn’t sound like a Kiez, who mostly wanted police protection from the vandalizing left.
The grave opened by the Berlin Interior Senator and the police between homeowners and their neighbors does not seem to exist.
Friedrichshain in East Berlin was in fact a traditional working-class district, which still today has a low average income and a high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.
Household occupancy and the resulting housing projects are also part of the Kiez for a long time: in 1990 many houses were occupied in the former DDR, including almost the entire Mainzer Straße very close to Riga.
While the Mainzers had been spawned under a large police order in a real street battle, many of the projects in Riga were legalized and are still inhabited today by the people they occupied 26 years ago.
At the same time, in recent years, the district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and voters from all over the world: with them now residents from DDR periods and former homeowners share their kiez.
This is also evident in the case of rentals, which have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 in new rentals.
Many of the new buildings in the Riga are attacked as symbols of this development: they are recognized on inserted slabs or freshly painted facades, which were thrown with paint bags.
No other road has been mentioned so often this year along with the words "left autonomous violence".
One reason not all neighbors see this as a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as bodily injury are almost exclusively directed against policemen, according to statistics.
Most of the crimes are damages that tend to affect new buildings and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neubauer, who has lived in a rented house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty.
As far as violence is concerned, it is abhorrent: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, who certainly weren’t.
Even the famous burning cars are no longer available directly in Riga.
For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: “Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more from each other than anywhere else.”
New builder consciously moved into the Riga street - and stayed.
That’s why it was so important for her to get the residents back on their way: from the police, politics and the media, all of which in July suddenly claimed the authority of interpretation over the district.
But in the eyes of residents like new builders, the road continues to be taken away from them: through faceless new buildings in former building gaps that displace the old inhabitants.
"Ultimately, these are apartments that are not interesting to many here - they are more likely to live here people who are not so well monitored," she says.
"Violence and destruction I can't at all cheer."
But what to do if you never listen to anyone?
There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the residents.
Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for those who are concerned about color bombs: the house projects and the left scene were part of the Kiez.
Anyone who moves should be aware of it – just like someone who moves into a bar area can complain badly about noise there.
All persons presented only with first names have asked not to be named by their proper name.
Urbach: Annika Deuschle is the new refugee commissioner
Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organization.
She is also a local social worker.
Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee commissioner for Urbach.
The social pedagogy supports the management team around Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a contact for all actors: refugees, refugee assistance, administration, authorities and anyone else involved.
Regine's client from the working circle suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is here now, the egg yolk that has a problem.
Thus, some - less ridiculous than aimed at the variety of desired task areas - had meant when the administration wanted to write off the position.
An administrative force with a talent for languages and people, coupled with many years of experience in the field of social work, was sought, just an egg-eating woolen dairy.
But administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle.
Above all, it is about organization, working with the people on the site and also behind the scenes as well as networking activity.
The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.
It has limited a 50-percent position to three years.
"It was high time," says Regine Kunde, that Annika Deuschle supports honorary and principal actors.
There are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.
Soon, new containers will be in the washway.
A serious problem is that for some time now there have been homes for connecting refugees who have been recognized.
The municipalities are responsible for the connection accommodation.
They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented dwellings.
The costs of building, renting or renovating these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
The responsibility shifts from the county office to the municipality and job center.
Problem: There are free properties, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
In fact, the administration does not find private apartments.
It hasn’t worked so far, relying on private apartments, says Deuschle.
Therefore, municipal apartments must be furnished as it is called so beautiful.
So new containers will soon be installed in the washway.
However, it is not done only with apartments.
Perspective is the keyword, Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a permanent stay, there are internships, training places, schools, one-euro jobs and relief activities for refugees and migrants that need to be found or established.
"More places would be good," reports Regine Kunde.
Many people work in the construction yard or help housekeepers, do non-profit work - and that is motivated and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports.
She hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external impact.
That's "no occupational therapy."
Activity is not just work.
The day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and customer.
People need to develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with locals and, above all, language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
This also involves administration and volunteers.
It is crucial that the refugees feel that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.
The length of the procedure is a problem.
They have to explain to the refugees that it takes a while and they can bridge the time meaningfully, for example with language courses.
Anyone who at some point develops the feeling that he can’t help anyone in Urbach should not work and be useless, who will never integrate.
The vast majority is motivated.
But there are also problems, says Kunde honestly, "people who don't go at all". Therefore, the work of Deuschle and Kunde is always also to motivate others.
All of this is a “mammut task.”
A difficult question: Are the two afraid of radicalisation after recent events, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No," says Regine Kunde quite clearly, "what some may call naive." A residual risk could and would not exclude them.
But the helpers are already being sensitized.
These incidents are also a problem for refugees.
They were afraid that the perpetrators would completely call them in.
“They want to show that they have nothing to do with it,” says Regine Kunde.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
So, chief and volunteers on the site and in the region need to look after activities.
They always have in mind that soon a new blow to refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.
Does Germany need an upper limit?
To answer this question clearly, politics is shy.
Actually, it’s unfair to put them on the spot.
"In Urbach we have not yet reached where we were going," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine Kunde also makes it clear that the urban planners are already tired of integrating the previous people reasonably.
Currently there are about 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, you have to help them, both women agree.
The political situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.
Schorndorf: Invaders with helicopters
The police helicopter flew across different areas for about an hour – unsuccessfully.
Two unknown men were violently invaded an apartment in a multi-family house in the Lindenweg on Friday morning at 8:50 p.m.
The resident surprised the two and struck the riots on the run.
The two men were about 1.65 to 1.70 meters tall, probably masked, both wearing bluejeans and black hoodie shirts.
They fled to downtown.
The police deployed several strip crews as well as a police helicopter.
The ride was unsuccessful.
Eventually, the unknowns found themselves near the apartment or on their flight before the incident.
Baden-Württemberg: Police investigate after rocker attack on Imbiss
After an attack on a Ulmer Imbiss, the police are investigating six suspects from the rocker environment for serious land peace violations.
Evidence and drugs were secured during housing searches, the police said on Friday.

After that, they attacked two guests and wounded one slightly.
Then they fled.
A damage of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10,000 was caused to the Imbiss and the adjacent building.
According to the investigators, there is a dispute in the Ulmer rock environment between a Kurdish and a Turkish gang.
