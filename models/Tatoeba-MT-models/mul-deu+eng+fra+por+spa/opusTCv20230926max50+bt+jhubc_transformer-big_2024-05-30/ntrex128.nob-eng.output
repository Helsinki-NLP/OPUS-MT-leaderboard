Welsh MPs don’t want to appear as “muppets”
Members of the Welsh National Assembly, known today under the abbreviation AM (Assembly Members), are not entirely satisfied with the proposal that their title may be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal comes as a result of plans to change the name of the National Assembly of the Welsh Parliament.
Representatives from all over the political spectrum fear that this could lead to ridicule.
A representative of the Labour Party explained his group was concerned because "it rhymes on Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means "dusted", and pwp means "b<0xC3><0xA6>sj".
A representative of the Wales party Plaid Cymru said the group as a whole was "dissatisfied" and that they had proposed alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh part of the Conservative Party said his group was "open" for the name change, but noted that the pronunciation of the MWP is very close to the word "Muppet", which, in addition to being the name of some famous dolls, is also a British slang for "dust".
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced in a similar way as the letter U is pronounced in the English Yorkshire dialect, more like a "uh" sound.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently developing laws to introduce the name change, said: "Of course, it is the members themselves who have the last right to determine what name they should be referred to."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 authorized the Welsh National Assembly to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation showing public support for renaming the National Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of the representatives, the Commission supported the WMPs (Welsh Parliament Members), but the MWP option received the most support during the public hearing.
Representatives are suggesting other options, but getting all parties to reach an agreement could lead to a headache for parliamentary president Elin Jones, who according to the plan is to deliver a bill for the name change over the next few weeks.
The legislation around the reform will include other changes in how the National Assembly works, including rules for disqualification of representatives and the design of the committee system.
Representatives have the last voting right on what to call them when they debate the legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls to decide whether to change the country's name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia can vote on whether their country's name should be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum is held in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which also has a region called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor constitutes a claim to their territory, and has on several occasions opposed the country's applications for membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum for the name change, has said he will ignore the vote.
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the name change is simply the price they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The Clock of St. Martin’s Silencer – the Crickets of Harlem Struggle
“The elders I talked to told me that before that time there was a bar and a church at every corner,” says Adams.
“Now there’s none of the parts.”
He said the bar's resignation was understandable.
“People interact socially with each other in other ways,” he says.
“Bars are no longer the meeting places of the local community, which everyone visits regularly.”
As for the churches, he fears that the money from selling assets will not last as long as the leaders believe. “And sooner or later they are back at the starting point.”
The churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment buildings full of the kind of people who will not help the remaining tents of the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of those who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,” he says, “and therefore will only accelerate the day when these churches must close their doors for good, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches.”
Both crickets were built by white churches before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original White Methodist movement moved out in the 1930s.
A nearby black congregation took over the building.
St. Martin's got a black congregation under priest John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of dealers on 125th Street—one of Harlem's main dealers—for failing to hire or promote black workers.
A fire in 1939 caused major damage to the building, and when Father Johnson's parishioners made plans for the reconstruction they purchased a carillon.
Priest David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly declared that the carillon was "the church bells of the poor".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument”.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played on by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to the largest carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin's never replaced him.
What has taken place at St. Martin's over the past few months is a complex interaction between architects and contractors, some of whom are hired by the church's law enforcement and others by the diocese.
The Council of Churches – the church’s leadership, made up of leg people – wrote to the diocese in July about its concern that the diocese would “try to impose costs” on the council, despite the fact that the council had not been involved in the appointment of the architects or contractors sent by the bishop.
Some parishioners complained of lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injures Thirteen-Year-Old On California Hummer Dive
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy when he appeared after a hummer in California on Saturday, the first day of the hummer season, according to the authorities.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had dive with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help, and that he and a group of others were swimming over to pull the boy out of the water.
According to Hammel, he first thought that the boy was screaming out of enthusiasm for catching a hummer, but he eventually realized that the boy was screaming 'I was bitten!
I was bitten!”
His entire collarbone was ripped up,” says Hammel, who discovered the damage when he reached the boy.
“I yelled that everyone had to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was transported by air ambulance to the Radi Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is being deployed in critical condition.
The type of shark that carried out the attack is not known.
Captain Larry Giles said at a news conference that a shark was seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous hair type.
Giles also said the victim suffered serious injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities shut off beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not employed as dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to make its income in UK's beauty market
Sainsbury's challenges Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with warehouse-like makeup and beauty care shelves, staffed by specially trained employees.
The expanded shelves are being tested in 11 stores around the country as part of a strong intake in the UK’s 2.8 million beauty market, which is experiencing continuous growth while the sales figures for clothes and household items are falling.
The investment in beauty care is the result of the supermarket’s attempts to find a new application for the space that was previously used for TVs, microwaves and home products.
Sainsbury's has said they will double the number of beauty products they offer to 3000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which the store chain has never sold before.
Existing product ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will also gain better place in notable brand areas, just like in stores like Boots.
The supermarket chain also relaunches its Boutique makeup brand with mainly vegan products, because there is an ever-increasing demand for this among younger customers.
In addition, fragrance retailer The Fragrance Shop will test out sales tables in two Sainsbury's stores, one opened in Croydon, South London last week, while the other will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and a new tendency to buy small amounts of food daily from local grocery stores means that supermarkets must do more to tempt customers to come.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, has said that sales will eventually become more and more like a warehouse, as the supermarket takes on the fight against the cheap stores Aldi and Lidl with more services and goods outside of food.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos outlets in hundreds of stores, and has also introduced a number of Habitat outlets after buying both chains two years ago. According to them, this has increased food sales and made purchases more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to upgrade the beauty and pharmacy departments was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership was settled after a dispute over the distribution of income from pharmacies in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281 store pharmacies to Celesio, owner of the pharmacy chain Lloyds Pharmacy, for GBP 125 million three years ago.
According to them, Lloyds will participate in the plan, by adding a selection of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury, said: “We have transformed the look and design of the beauty shelves to create a more inviting environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who are then ready to give advice and help.
Our brand range is designed to meet all needs, and the inviting environment and convenient locations make us now a beauty-care competitor representing a new shopping experience.”
Peter Jones Is 'Scared' After Holly Willoughby Resigns From <0xC2><0xA3>11 Million Deal
Dragons star Peter Jones is reportedly angry after TV host Holly Willoughby resigned from an 11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for their home and accessories brand, Truely.
Their company was previously compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand, Goop.
Willoughby, 37, who is the program manager for This Morning, announced on Instagram that she is leaving the company.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons' The Star Peter Jones angry by retreating from their profitable lifestyle brand at the last second to focus on her own new gold-edged contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was “crazy” at a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire. It was here that the yellow-yellows of television admitted that her new deals – worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million – mean that she no longer has time to light up and dress.
The company has been compared with Gwyneth Paltrow's brand, Goop, and it was expected to double Willoughby's estimated assets of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she would leave True, Jones left the UK on her way to one of her vacation homes.
One source said: “Truly was undoubtedly Holly’s first priority.
It was a long-term investment that would give her financial security over the next few decades.
Everyone is shocked that she has chosen to resign.
No one could believe it when it happened last Tuesday – it was just before the launch.
Now there is a warehouse full of goods at the headquarters in Marlow that is now ready for sale.”
Experts believe that the This Morning program manager, one of the UK’s most popular stars, could cost the company several millions of pounds due to large investments in products such as pillows and lights, fashion and goatwear, as well as a potential delay in launching.
This could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for the past ten years.
Willoughby created True with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) became chairman of the board in March.
The two couple go on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of the ITV program I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said yesterday, “We will not comment on his business affairs.”
“And then we fell in love.”
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media for making a comment some would consider to be “little presidential act,” and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his imitation of a news anchor.
“I haven’t given up anything.”
He noted that Kim is interested in a new meeting, having himself declared that their first meeting in Singapore in June was a big crap on the way to North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
But the nuclear disarmament negotiations have stopped.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not seen a “similar response” from the United States to its early disarmament measures.
He noted that the United States, instead, still has sanctions aimed at keeping pressure up.
Trump had a much more positive attitude when he spoke for an assembly of his voters.
“We are doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
“We were going to war against North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a great relationship.”
He said his work to improve the relationship with Kim has yielded positive results, such as putting a stop to rocket fighters, helping to free hostages, and getting the remains of U.S. officials sent home.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about the relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to act with presidential dignity, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this staggering arena, we’d have around 200 people standing right here,” Trump said.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia ravages island and kills hundreds of people
In the wake of the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-profit organizations were told that their help was not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10% of Lombok’s residents had lost their homes, it was not declared a national disaster, which is a requirement for international aid to be submitted.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it quite clear that they are not asking for international help, so it is quite challenging,” Sumbung explained.
Save the Children is now putting together a team to travel to Palu, but is not yet sure whether foreign employees will be allowed to work in the country.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the National Agency for Crisis Management, said that Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organizations should be allowed to contribute to the relief work.
Taking into account the constant earthquakes that Indonesia is facing, the country is terriblely poorly prepared to deal with the anger of nature.
The shelter to protect against tsunamis is built in Aceh, but they are not a common sight along other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a warning syringe on Palu, although a warning had been sent out, has probably contributed to the death figures.
Even under the best of circumstances, it is a challenge to travel between the many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters make logistics even more challenging.
A hospital ship that was stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the scene of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made an upgrade of Indonesia’s fall-out infrastructure a key point in his election campaign and has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But money shortages have been a major problem for the Jokos administration, which is due to run for re-election next year.
President Joko is also under pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have switched to a more conservative form of Islam.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to flee their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with maquettes, arrows and bows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge with late match off against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea on Saturday by scoring in the 89th minute of the match at Stanford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 metres from the Chelsea goal while his team was 1-0 behind.
He moved the ball to the left foot before sending it to the longest corner.
The experiment went high over the box as the ball dashed toward the upper right corner of the net.
The ball eventually went over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
“I was just trying to get to that position and get the ball, and players like Shaq are always sending the ball forward as well as possible, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante come and touch the ball once and didn’t think too much about it and just kicked it further.”
Chelsea led by 1-0 at the break, after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues striker sent a heel pass back to Mateo Kovacic, before changing direction near the midfield and sprinting into Liverpool's half-field.
Kovacic came with a quick delivery on the midfield.
He then fired a great breakthrough pass that brought Hazard into the box.
Hazard ran faster than the defense and drove the ball into the net in the longest corner with a left foot kick past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play against Naples in the group game of the Champions League at 15.00 on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against Videoton in the European Men's Football League in London at 15:00 on Thursday.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia reaches 832
Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami death tolls have risen to 832, the country's emergency management agency said early Sunday.
It was reported that many were trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed after the earthquake with a 7.5 strike that hit the country on Friday and caused waves of up to six meters, the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was full of materials from razed buildings.
Police arrest man (32) for murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 p.m. in Grayson Mews, John Street, where a 32-year-old man is arrested, suspected of murder.
Police have asked people in the area who have seen or heard anything about contacting.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "We're at the very beginning of the investigation, but I'd like to ask anyone in the area around John Street in Birkenhead to see or hear anything suspicious about contacting us.
We also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught something on their car camera, to contact them – they may have information that is crucial to our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the deceased woman was a resident in Birkenhead and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have arrived at the scene to ask questions about the place where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and police have said they are working to inform the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but has been told that no one is allowed to enter or exit the building.
He was pointless when he discovered what had happened.
Residents are now told that it will take several hours before they get back in.
A police officer was interrogated, telling a man that the entire area is now being treated as an incident.
A crying woman appeared on the scene.
She repeats “it’s so horrible” over and over again.
At 14:00, two police cars were behind the lock, while a third car was just outside.
A number of police officers were standing outside the lockdown and were overseeing the apartment complex.
Individuals with information are asked to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimetoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, by referring to “log 247” from September 30.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell is the last monument drawn into the fight for "rewriting history"
The removal of the statue would be poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of many of England's cultural and religious treasures carried out by his fanatical Puritans.
But the Comwell Society has described Jeremy Crick's publishing house as "unbelievable" and "an attempt to rewrite the story".
John Goldsmith, head of the Cromwell Society, says: “It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell’s figure outside the Westminster Palace also became a target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil War was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps wrong Cromwell will be punished for the sins of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's stunning depiction of Cromwell is evidence of 19th-century opinions and is part of the historiography of a man many believe still deserves to be praised.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps later in the 19th century than today, as Parliament defends against outside pressure – in his time, of course, it was talking about the monarchy.
Whether this is an exact representation is still subject to historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-18th century has shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure representing one side of that conflict.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembered.”
Killing pig kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China, according to local news reports.
The man, mentioned only by the surname "Yuan", was found dead and covered with blood from a broken heartbeat near a binge at the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to vaccinate pigs on May 30, 2005 on a farm in the city of Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead, and discovered that the gate to a nearby pig path was open.
He said that inside the pig trail there was a big wrong man with blood on his mouth.
A forensic investigation confirmed that the 250 kg pig had killed the man.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and maltracted," the cousin, mentioned with the surname Wu, explained in a quote to Guiyang Evening News.
Records from the surveillance camera showed that Yuan entered the market at 4.40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan did not belong to him or his cousin.
While the police collected evidence from the scene, one of the market leaders explained that the pig was locked in to prevent it from attacking anyone else.
Yuan's family and market leadership are allegedly negotiating compensation for the death.
This is not the first time that a pig has been infected.
In 2016, a pig attacked a couple on a farm in Massachusetts, injuring the man.
Ten years earlier, a Welsh farmer was pushed up against a tractor and attacked by a 300 kg pig until the farmer’s wife managed to chase the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not aggressive as usual, but that the taste of blood can have a triggering effect.
“They’re just playing.
They like to bite, and are very curious ... they are not trying to hurt anyone.
You just have to show enough respect.”
Remains of Hurricane Rosa will lead to heavy rain in southwestern U.S.
As reported, Hurricane Rosa is weakened as it moves over the cooler sea on the northern coast of Mexico.
Rosa, however, will bring flooding on her journey through northern Mexico and southwestern the United States over the next few days.
Rosa had a wind speed of 135 km/h and was a Category 1 hurricane at 05.00 ET on Sunday, and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical moisture north towards the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will cause up to 25 cm of rainfall in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the interaction between tropical moisture and the approaching storm will lead to widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, 3 to 10 cm of rain will lead to dangerous flooding, floating debris and rapid and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will lead to precipitation rates of up to 5–7 cm per hour in some areas, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 5–10 cm of rain is expected in parts of the southwestern country, especially over large parts of Arizona.
There are chances of flooding with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered tropical rainfall.
It is very unwise to move around in the desert on foot as long as there is a danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rains can cause river valleys to turn into wide-ranging rivers, and the storm will lead to local windmills that may contain dust and sand.
The noise that is approaching will cause local heavy rainfall for parts of the coast along Southern California.
Total rainfall above 1.3 cm is possible, and this can lead to floating rubbish and fast, as well as smooth road tracks.
This will be the first rainfall in the area.
Some scattered tropical rainfall will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before rain spreads later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the corner states on Tuesday and will continue throughout Wednesday.
October may cause some intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States as the Arctic gets colder but the tropics remain very hot.
Sometimes this leads to drastic temperature changes over shorter distances.
We will see a clear example of strong temperature differences throughout the central U.S. on Sunday.
There will be almost 11 degrees temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, persistent summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Large parts of central and eastern U.S. are likely to get a warm start in October, with degrees high in the twentieth from the Southern Plains to parts of northeastern U.S.
New York City can reach 26.5 degrees on Tuesday – this will be about 5.5 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate report indicates that the eastern United States will most likely have higher temperatures than usual throughout the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh hearings
More than 20 million viewers, distributed across six television networks, saw Thursday’s gripping testimony from Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that was supposed to take place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political feud continued, and broadcasters interrupted their regular broadcasts to announce Friday’s big surprise in the last second, when it emerged that Arizona Senator Jeff Flake had arranged for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate court committee that she was 100 percent sure that a drunken Kavanaugh had taken over her and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
In a passionate testimony, Kavanaugh insisted that he is 100 percent sure that this did not happen.
The broadcast on Friday was probably seen by more than the 20.4 million Nielsen reported.
The company calculated average viewers for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Audience numbers were not immediately available for other networks that showed the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also usually has trouble measuring office owners.
To give a little perspective, this is the spectator number corresponding to the final game of the American Football Championship or the Oscar award.
Fox News Channel, whose audiences have supported Kavanaugh’s appointment with great enthusiasm, led the networks, with an average viewership of 5.69 million for the full-day audience, according to Nielsen.
ABC was number two with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CCNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest was still great after the hearing.
Flake was the protagonist of Friday's drama.
On Friday morning, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras as he tried to take the elevator to a courtroom meeting as protesters shouted and yelled at him.
He stood with a low glance for several minutes while being screened out, while the incident was broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m right in front of you,” said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling our country the truth?”
He was told that “you have the power when so many women are powerless.”
Flake pointed out that his office had made a statement, saying as the elevator doors closed that he would have more to say about the matter at the committee hearing.
Cable and broadcasting networks covered all the hearings directly several hours later, as the court committee was to vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination would be passed on to the entire Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he was only willing to do this if the FBI investigated the charges against the candidate by next week, which the democratic minority has called for.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after talking to the Coons and then several other senators.
Flake's election had a big impact, as it was clear that the Republicans did not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without this investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May accuses critics of 'political game' around Brexit
In an interview with The Sunday Times, British Prime Minister Theresa May has accused opponents of her plan to leave the EU to run “political games” with Britain’s future and undermine the nation’s interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, printed side-by-side with her own on the front of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson has continued her attack on her so-called “Chequers” Brexit plan by saying a proposal for Britain and the EU to collect each other’s tariffs was “totally ridiculous”.
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, who is suspected of causing the death of the LSU player
Police have arrested a man suspected of shooting and killing Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University.
Dyteon Simpson (20) is arrested and prosecuted for deliberate murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities have released a video footage of the confrontation between Sims and Simpsons, and police say the Sims lost their glasses during the basketball roof.
Police found the glasses on the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS partner WAFB.
After interrogating Simpson, police said he admits to having shot and killed Wayde.
His deposit is set at <0x24>350,000, according to The Advocate.
The forensic doctor in East Baton Rouge Parish published a preliminary report on Friday, indicating the cause of death as a shot wound in the head and through the throat.
The police thank the Louisiana State Police working group for the seizure of refugees, the state police laboratory, the Southern University police and the local population for their contribution to the investigation that led to a detention.
LSU sports leader Joe Alleva thanked the area's police force for his "hard work and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2 m tall forward player grew up in Baton Rouge, and his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 returns per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "broken" and "in shock" after Wayde's death.
“That’s what we fear at all times,” Wade said.
Vulcan sprays ash over Mexico City
The ashes splashing out of the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southernmost neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital.
The Centro Nacional de Prevención de Desastres, Mexico’s public agency for crisis prevention, warned Mexico’s population on Saturday that they should stay away from the volcano after activity rose in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded within a day.
The state monitored several cases of bullying and shaking.
Images on social media showed a thin layer of ash covering windscreens on cars in neighborhoods like Xochimilco, Mexico City.
Geophysicists have detected increased activity from the volcano, which is 72 km southeast of the capital after a 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police in clashes with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the Independence Movement
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after Protestants for independence clashed with police, while thousands took part in competing demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarizing vote on independence.
A group of masked separatists were held back by the rebel police, bombing them with eggs and powder paint, causing dark dust clouds in streets that are usually full of tourists.
Handfuls also broke out later in the day, as police used batons to limit fighting.
For several hours, independence protesters stood and shouted "Never forget, never forgive", face to face with unionist protesters who shouted "Long Live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries they received during the protests, according to the local press.
The tension is still high in the liberation-oriented region one year after the October 1 referendum, which was considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The vote showed an overwhelming amount of dismissal, but there was poor attendance because the vote was boycotted by the majority of those opposed to the release.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent confrontations last year, after police tried to stop the vote held at polling stations across the region.
Liberation groups camped in the streets night to Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration was held, however, but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had hopes for Catalonia’s chance of becoming independent.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
“I saw my parents crying with joy to get the vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite achieving a narrow but decisive victory in regional elections last December, parties that support Catalan independence have had trouble keeping pressure up this year, after which many of their well-known leaders have travelled in self-imposed exile or are in detention while awaiting the trial of the unrepentant on the part of their people.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who used her phone to film the protest to support the police, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is getting more and more tense,” he explained.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders imprisoned in anticipation of a trial since late last year, announced that he will stand in elections to the European Parliament next year.
"To stand in the election as a candidate in the European elections is the best thing I can do to condemn the oppression and regression from democratic values we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Man Arrested After Car Was Driven Into a House Wall
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car was driven several times into the wall of a Londonderry house.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19.30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said the incident had caused damage to the gate and the building itself.
An armrest may also have been fired at the car at some point.
Mengas attack leads to Livingston's 1-0 win against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livinston surprised the Rangers, who delivered Stevens Gerrard's second loss after 18 games as manager for the Ibrox club.
A good match from Dolly Menge turned out to be crucial, and Gary Holt’s side is now in second place similar to Hibernian.
Gerrard's side has not yet won the Premier League away this season and is set to play against the Hearts, who are eight points ahead of them, next Sunday.
The Rangers will play their home game against Rapid Wien in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, for his part, has remained unbeaten through six games in the division. Chief Coach Holt has not yet lost a game after he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against its sloppy guests
Holt's team should have led long before they scored, as their direct approach caused countless problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through but bombed on the goal, and Alan Lithgow could only send fired further after slipping in to meet Craig Halkett header past the goal.
The host allowed Rangers to play in front of them, knowing that they could make trouble for their guests at the death ball.
And that was how the decisive goal came about.
Rangers gave up a free kick and Livingston found an opening – Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaborated to give Menge a clear path, and he scored a goal from the middle of the box.
Within this stage, the Rangers had had the ball almost all the time, but the home team's defense had turned out to be impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little to worry about.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos performed a near-scoring that had to be saved by Kelly.
Scott Pittman was blocked by the feet of Rangers keeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgrow sent a Livingston death ball in a wide card match.
Crossings continued to enter the Livingston box and were still saved, while two penalties were overlooked – once after Halkett’s protest against the replacement of Glenn Middleton, and once at hand.
“Fenomenal” from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were all amazing, and continue to exceed all expectations on the way up.
The style of play and the crew have barely changed since they got to the top again, but Holt is expected to have much of the honour for the way he has strengthened the team after his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was fantastic and coordinated a hugely well-organized defense, while Mengea held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout the game.
Rangers, on the other hand, did not have my inspiration to divorce.
Although at times they have been very good under Gerrard, they were not able to live up to this standard.
The last part of the game was lab – they only entered the home team half once – and it was a bit of a wake-up call for the Rangers, which is in the middle of the table.
Erdogan gets mixed reception in Cologne
Everything was just a smile and blue sky on Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany ate lunch together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
Differences have arisen over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police provided security as the reason why a crowd of 25,000 were not allowed to gather in front of the mosque, but many supporters showed up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan – many of them Kurds – also heard from themselves, criticizing both Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to let him into the country.
The contradictory demonstrations reflect the split that follows a man who is honored as a hero by some German Turks and hated as an autocrat by others.
Deptford collision: cyclist killed in car collision
A cyclist was killed in a collision with a passenger car in London.
The collision took place at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, which is a busy veil in Deptford southeast of the city, around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was treated by ambulance personnel, but the man died on the spot.
The collision takes place just one month after a cyclist died in a collision where the driver escaped from the scene on Childrens Street, about a mile from Saturday’s collision.
Metropolitan Police said the police were working on identifying the man and notifying his relatives.
Roadblocks and buses are in place, and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six police officers injured in riots
Six prison officers were injured in an incident at a high-security prison for men, according to the prison authorities.
riots broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST on Sunday, and are still ongoing.
Specialized "Tornado" officers have been brought in to handle the incident, involving eight inmates and are limited to one flight.
Police were treated for minor facial injuries on the spot.
A prison service spokesman said: “Specially trained prison personnel have been sent to handle an ongoing event at HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons – the responsible will be transferred to the police and may have to spend even more time behind locks and knocks.”
HMP Long Lartin is home to more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager received hospital treatment after being attacked by a detainee.
And in October last year, the rebel police were called to deal with a serious incident in which employees were attacked with billiard bullets.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding (may be beneficial for drought areas)
It’s the hurricane Arizona hit by a tropical low pressure, but that’s likely to happen early next week, as Hurricane Rosa’s remaining force moves through desert areas in the southwest and leads to flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will move in a straight line through Phoenix on Tuesday, and that the rainy weather will begin late Monday evening.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix has noted on Twitter that "only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane until it was 65 km from the border with Arizona."
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict 5–10 cm of rainfall, with up to 15 cm in some places in Mongollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas within the desert in the southwest, including the middle of the Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, are likely to get between 2.5 and 5 cm, while up to 10 cm rainfall is possible in some areas.
For those who are out of danger of flooding, Rosa can be a blessing, since the area suffers from drought.
Although flooding is a serious problem, some of this rainfall is likely to be favourable, as the southwestern United States is currently in a drought state.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, slightly over 40 percent of Arizona experiences at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category,” according to weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa lands on the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa still has hurricane strength on Sunday morning, with maximum wind strength of 137 km, is 620 km from Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moves 19 km/h.
The storm encounters colder waters in the Pacific Ocean, thereby losing power.
Therefore, it is expected to hit Mexico with tropical storm force on Monday evening or afternoon.
Rainfall over parts of Mexico can be severe and lead to major flooding hazards.
"Total rainfall of 7.5–15 cm is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with chances of up to 25 cm rainfall," according to weather.com.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm until it hits the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which then moves further through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday evening.
"The main danger expected by Rosa or its remains is very strong rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert of the United States," according to the National Hurricane Center.
This precipitation is expected to produce life-threatening floods and floating debris and fast in the desert and landslides in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Murder Attempt
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man are arrested, suspected of attempted murder, after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area by Midsomer Norton around 4:00 BST on Sunday.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, according to police in Avon and Somerset.
Police have asked anyone who may have a mobile record of the incident to contact.
Trump Says Kavanaugh Has “Suffered Under the Minority and Mind” of the Democratic Party
“A vote to support Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said in a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has “suffered under the minority and mind” of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying the charges made by Christine Blasey Ford that he committed a sexual assault against her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified about his indictment during the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that “the American people saw how brilliant, talented, and brave” Kavanaugh was that day.
“A voice to support Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to support one of the most skilled lawyers of our time, with flawless public service skills,” he told an assembly of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president discreetly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke of the importance of Republicans voting in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
I’m not really a participant, but I’m a participant,” he said.
“That’s why I travel around and fight for the best candidates.”
Trump said the Democrats aimed to “resist and prevent.”
The Senate's first midterm vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, according to an assistant to a leader within the Republican Party told CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, figures are expected to rise
At least 384 people were killed and many were dragged out into the sea by huge waves sweeping towards the beaches when a major earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesian island Slavesi, according to authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves of up to six meters in height blurred in lands around sunset, destroyed everything in their way and led many to the death of the drowned.
The tsunami hit the heels of an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
“When the tsunami danger arose yesterday, people were still running activities on the beach, did not flee immediately and ended up as victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia’s Bureau of Crisis Management (BNBP) at a press conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami wasn’t alone – it brought cars, tree trunks and houses, it hit everything on the ground,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before it hit the coastline.
Some climbed up trees to escape the tsunami and survived."
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photographs published by the Emergency Management Authority showed many demolished buildings and shops, distorted and crushed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The earthquake continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
The row of earthquakes could be felt by 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Agency for the Assessment and Use of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the power from Friday’s massive earthquake was about 200 times more than the power of the atomic bomb that was released over Hiroshima during World War II.
The location of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay may have made the tsunami larger, according to the agency.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the deaths and injuries could be the coast of a larger country 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the heart of the earthquake.
The communication "was completely confused, completely without information" from Donggala, according to Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a press release, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
On Saturday, the agency was heavily criticized for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, but the authorities said the waves had hit before the warning was issued.
In an amateur footage shared on social media, you hear a man on the top floor of a building screaming desperate warnings that the tsunami is approaching passers-by on the street below.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water sweeps towards the beach, and flows with buildings and cars.
Reuters has not been able to immediately authenticate the recordings.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that has hindered communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending transport aircraft with the help of Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuees still desperately need food and other necessities.
The airport is only open for auxiliary work and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia rises to over 800.
That's terrible.
World Vision staff from Donggala have safely arrived in the center of Palu, where they have sought refuge under the gazette in the courtyard in front of their office, but they have suffered major damage on the road, according to Doseba Sinai.
“They told me they saw hundreds of destroyed houses,” he said.
That's terrible.
As aid organizations began the dark preparations to provide emergency aid, some complained that foreign aid workers with a lot of expertise were refused to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, money, supplies and workers from abroad cannot be released into a crisis area until it is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a provincial disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says ‘Okay, this is a national disaster’ we can open the borders of international aid, but the situation has not yet received any status.”
As the sun sets on Palu for the second time after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those who are still missing hope that their loved ones will be among the miraculous stories that illuminate the dark news picture after tragic natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was fished out of a sewer.
On Sunday, a woman was liberated by rescue crews after spending two days trapped in ruins with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which were held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Several of those trapped in the ruins of the Roa Roa Hotel, including Petra Mandagi, were also his students.
“As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional should wear,” he said.
Gendon said that in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel spread in the paragliding environment, he sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the athletes who participated in the beach festival in Palu.
But the messages led only to gray hammer marks, rather than a couple of blue hammer marks.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he said.
Thieves steal <0x24>26,750 during mini-banking in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole <0x24>26,750 from a Brink's worker who filled a mini-bank in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver had emptied a mini-bank in the entertainment complex and prepared to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, there was another man who "runted behind the Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money that was to be delivered.
Witnesses saw more suspects fleeing the scene, according to the press release, but police have not specified how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity must contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “The creation formerly known as Kanye West.”
West (41) has been nicknamed Ye for a long time, using the name as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes before his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande on the show, after she canceled on an "emotional basis", according to the series creator.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'yes' is the most widely used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year, discussing the album title with the radio host Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, it is us.
It went from being Kanye, meaning the only one, to only Ye – as a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, all.
The album is more a representation of who we are.”
He is one of many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has been known as both Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has previously collaborated with West, has also varied between the use of strings and capital letters.
Mexico’s AMLO vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexico's accession president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has sworn he will never use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that he "will never use the military to suppress the Mexican people".
Military troops fired at a peaceful demonstration on the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people, during a period when leftist student movements ravaged across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead young people into criminal gangs.
U.S. Should Double Financial Support for Artificial Intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount they spend on research in this field, according to Kai Fu Lee, an investor and AI practitioner, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments come after several departments of the U.S. government have made announcements on artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the U.S. generally does not have a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
China, for its part, introduced a plan last year and aims to be the No. 1 in Artificial Intelligence Innovation by 2030.
“A double research budget for artificial intelligence will be a good starting point since all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next big breakthrough,” Lee said.
“Double financial support could double the chance that the next big achievement in artificial intelligence will come from the United States,” Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the director of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the leading artificial intelligence companies in China, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University to develop a system of artificial intelligence that beat the best Othello player in the United States, and later was a head of Microsoft Research or director of Google's Chinese department.
Lee recognized the U.S. government’s previous technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be held, to help find the next generation of smart heads.
Scientists in the United States often have to work very hard to receive state grants, according to Lee.
“It’s not China stealing the academic leaders, it’s the companies,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired smart heads from universities to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee says changes in immigration policy could also help the United States strengthen its efforts in artificial intelligence.
“I believe that those who have a doctoral degree in artificial intelligence should receive an offer of residence permit automatically,” he said.
The Chinese Council issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan for the development of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation finances people at academic institutions, in a similar way as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations allocate money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, according to Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a <0x24>2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, they are currently investing more than <0x24>100 million in AI research.
At the same time, the U.S. law that aims to establish a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has been suspended for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing the country's name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia" to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has blocked their attempts to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Greece, which also has a province called Macedonia, believes that the northern neighbor's name constitutes a claim on Greek territory, and has vetoed their inclusion in NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposed new hub, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycott campaign has raised doubts whether the meeting will meet the minimum requirement of 50 percent, which is mandatory for the vote to be valid.
The question on the ballot is: “Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership at the time of approval of the agreement with Greece?”
Those who support the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying this price for Macedonia, a country that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia, to be able to join organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protective umbrella of the EU, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79) in Skopje.
Even if it is not legally binding, it will probably be decisive because a sufficient number of MEPs have said that they will comply with the results of the vote.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The state election commission said it had not received any irregularity reports by 13.00.
However, the meeting was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the previous 2016 parliamentary elections, when 66 percent of registered voters cast their vote.
“I came to vote because of my children – we belong in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko vote in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018. The referendum in Macedonia is about changing the country’s name to open the doors so that they can become members of NATO and the EU.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, made a small scene and pulled out chairs in front of tents set up by those to boycott the vote.
“We are positive for NATO and the EU, but we want to get in with our heads up, not get stuck in the back way,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to countries like China and Russia and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will lead to a desperate investment in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I think the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 of our citizens want us to become members of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said.
He says that a “yes” response will be a “confirmation of our future.”
According to a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum, which is lower than the required attendance.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV, showed that 57 percent of black people have plans to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be valid, the attendance must be 50 percent plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious political obstacle the pro-Western government has supported since it took over in May last year.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero maneuvers past all of Brighton's defense to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling crushed the Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2–0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a pass at the start of the sequence.
He raced with three Brighton defenders before coming out on open ground.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He turned around one defender before running from several on the edge of the Brighton box.
Then he sent a pass to the left that reached Sterling.
The English striker used his first touch in the box to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right shoe to beat Brighton's keeper Matthew Ryan with a shot into the right side of the net.
“Aguero is still struggling with some foot problems,” City manager Pep Guardiola told the press.
"We talked about him playing for 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
He was lucky that he scored a goal right then.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the original advantage in the Premier League match.
This goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball placed inside Brighton's territory.
He sent a beautiful breakthrough pass along the left flank to Leory Sane.
Sane had a couple of touches before he led Sterling to the longest corner.
The Sky Blues attacker sent the ball into the net just before it was over the deadline.
City will play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game at 12.55 on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer will be a spoiler for Rockies
Nationals are no longer candidates for playoffs, and have no reason to bet heavily.
The ever-likely competitive Scherzer still hopes to be on the pitch on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if it can affect the playoff opportunities of the Colorado team, which leads the Los Angeles Dodgers with one game in the NL West.
The Rockies won a wild card spot with a 5–2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking to secure their first division title.
“Although we have nothing to win, we can at least play with the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver, with the audience and the other team, will most likely be the highest game level I can play this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate in it?”
The Nationals have not yet announced their starting pitches for Sunday, but are said to be inclined to take Scherzer pitches in such a situation.
Sherzser, who in this case is the starting pitcher for the 34th time, had a bullpen session on Thursday, and will throw with normal rest on Sunday.
The right-handed Washington player has won 18 games this season and lost 7, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 rounds.
Trump's People's Assembly in West Virginia
The president discreetly referred to the situation around Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh while talking about how important it is for Republicans to vote in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our life.
This is one of the big, big ... I’m not a participant, but I’m a participant. That’s why I travel around and fight for the best candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this cruel, cruel group of radical democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to take power back at all costs, where you see the smallness and the evil.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to override to gain power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, we’re not going to give it to them.”
The Democrats, he said, aim to "resist and prevent".
“And you’ve seen it over the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “rageous and evil and ugly and dishonest.”
He referred to the Senate Judicial Committee and mentioned Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, after which the audience turned out loud.
“Do you remember her answer?
Have you leaked the document?
Um, um, what.
No, um no, I’m waiting for one – it was very bad body language – the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Labour is no longer open to everyone.
They don’t tolerate people who say their opinions.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, it was hardly another surprise.
After all, I am the last of a long series of Labour Members who have been told that we are not welcome, just because we say what we mean.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she was very critical of anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was supposed to be censored because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On how important it is to have responsible economic policies, on national security, on Europe – ironically, similar issues that Jeremy disagreed with former leaders.
In a statement to the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday, it was stated that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as the local Labour representative, the GC meetings on Friday nights have been exactly this.
Unfortunately, this is no longer the mood of many of the meetings, and the promise of “softer, more friendly” policies has long been forgotten, if it ever began at all.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different opinions are not allowed in the working party, and all opinions are judged on the basis of whether they are acceptable to the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, when colleagues I previously believed that I shared many political stances with suddenly began to expect me to take an U-turn and stand for opinions I had never previously agreed with, whether they were about the security of the nation or the EU internal market.
When I speak publicly – and it doesn’t matter what I say – I receive a bunch of ugly messages on social media that require me to be deposed, condemn central policy and tell me that I shouldn’t be in Labour.
And it’s not just me who has experienced this.
I know that I am more fortunate than any of my colleagues, because the comments I receive are usually political.
I know how professional and targeted these colleagues are when they meet an ocean of gender-discriminatory and racist comments every day, but never allow themselves to cake.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how gross deflection has been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we are no longer such a party that is open to all, and every mistrust proposal and every change in the rules of the election becomes the party narrower.
I’ve received a lot of advice over the past two years where I’m encouraged to keep my head low and not raise my voice so much, because it’ll “make everything better.”
But that’s not why I got involved in politics.
Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a school student, provoked by the Thatcher government’s negligence that had led to my classroom at the public school I attended, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most, both as a local counselor and a government minister.
I have never concealed my political views, nor have I concealed my political views in previous elections.
No one in Nottingham East may in any way have misunderstood my political views or disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who presented the proposal on Friday, I just want to say that as the country is racing our way towards a Brexit that will hurt individuals, businesses and public services, I cannot understand and understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But the message I really want to convey is not to Nottingham Momentum – it’s to those I represent, whether they’re Labour members or not: I’m proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of deposition or political incompetence will stop me from doing what I think best protects your interests.

Ayr 38 – 17 Melrose: Unbeaten Ayr rises to the top
Two late attempts have changed the final result a bit, but there was no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this amazingly entertaining Tennent's Premiership game.
They are now at the top of the table, and are the only undefeated of the ten.
In the end, there were as many of their superior defenses as their ability to take advantage of the opportunities that led to the home team losing the victory, and coach Peter Murchie had good reason to be satisfied.
"We have been challenged in our games so far and are still unbeatable, so I must be happy with that," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “All the honors to Ayr, they were better to take advantage of the opportunities than we were.”
Grant Anderson's 14th minute attempt, with a goal from Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the lead, but a yellow card to Scottish captain Rory Hughes, borrowed from the Warriors, allowed Melrose to balance the position, and Jason Baggot performed an attempt without a goal.
Climo strengthened Ayr's leadership with a penalty kick before he, just before the break, scored and scored a solo attempt to change his position to 17–5 at the break.
But Melrose started the second half strongly, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, with a goal from Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
This resulted in a prolonged stay in connection with a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried out on board, and from the restart, Ayr's management increased even more an attempt from Stafford McDowell, with a goal from Climo.
Ayr's acting captain, Blain Macpherson, then got a yellow card and Melrose took advantage of having an extra man on the field to the fullest with an attempt by Bruce Colvine without a target, at the end of a period of high pressure.
However, the home team came back strong, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for tackling Climo when he didn't have the ball, MacPherson performed a touchdown by pitching behind the advancing Ayr moule.
Climo performed a goal pitch, as he did again almost entirely from the start, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's boxing pitch and sent flanks Gregor Henry leaving for the home team's fifth attempt.
Still Game star ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears to be entering the serving industry – it was recently discovered that he is appointed as the director of a gift-giving restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, for which he writes the script and plays in conjunction with his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The Duen has announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is now planning his life after Craiglang.
According to public records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor would not comment on the case, but a source from The Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "living restaurant industry".
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, a country without coastline, hopes the court will open the way to the Pacific
Marines patroll a riggin-covered Marine Headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings lift a sea blue flag.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are decorated with the motto: “We have a right to the sea.
It is our duty to reclaim it.”
The entire inland state of Bolivia has still freshly remembered the coastline they lost to Chile during a bloody 19th-century resource conflict, and the country longs to be able to sail the Pacific once again.
These hopes may be greater than they have been for decades, with Bolivia awaiting a judgement from the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of debate.
“Bolivia has a drive, a spirit of community and peace of mind, and of course awaits the outcome with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the verdict of the International Court of Justice on the big screen in many different places in the country, hoping that the Court of The Hague will give its verdict in favour of Bolivia’s claim that Chile – after decades of sporadical negotiations – is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia its own outlet.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, who faces a controversial re-election campaign next year, has also put a lot on Monday’s verdict.
"We are very close to a return to the Pacific," he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to take the Bolivian party, and that very little would change if it had done so.
The U.N. agency, as the team in the Netherlands, has no authority to allow them to leave Chilean territories, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The judgement from the International Court of Justice comes just six months after the last arguments were heard suggests that the case was “not complicated,” according to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And rather than promoting the case of Bolivia, the last four years could actually have made things worse.
"The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
She believes that Morales' antagonistic rhetoric has wiped out any remaining goodwill on the Chilean side.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the negotiations at one point or another, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the matter after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltsé, Bolivia’s representative at The Hague, rejected the theory that the court’s decision came unusually quickly.
According to him, Monday will give Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to open up a new generation of relations with Chile” and the opportunity to “stop 139 years of disagreement, for the benefit of both parties.”
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, has used the maritime situation as a political cover-up.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific," he added.
“Conscience is an opportunity to see what we have to do to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would never arm its nuclear weapons if they could not trust the U.S. government.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to keep its promises during a meeting between the leaders of the two opposing countries in Singapore.
These comments come at the same time as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be ready to launch a tight-knit nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a “wishful dream” that continued sanctions and U.S. resistance is a declaration ending the Korean War that will ever force North Korea on its knees.
U.S. authorities are skeptical about accepting the declaration without Pyongyang launching significant disarmament measures first.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, the president of the United States, want a second meeting.
But there is widespread doubt as to whether Pyongyang really plans to release an arsenal the country is likely to view as the only security guarantee they have.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest in huge headwear, which is on its way to a clothing store near you
If you want some great additions to the hat collection or hide completely from the sun, you don’t need to look anymore.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a selection of unusual, oversized headwear as part of their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which impressed the fashion lions at the fashion show in Paris.
Very impractical hats have been popular on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations down the catwalk.
Valentino's most striking outfit was an exaggerated beige hat decorated with a feather-like wide brace that drowned the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included jeweled watermelons, a wizard hat or even an ananas, but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the last scream.
One creation recalled diving equipment, including snorkeling and diving glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream in cookies.
And if you are looking for even bigger fashion accessories, then you are lucky.
Style experts predict that the huge hats may be on their way to a clothing store near you.
The oversized hats come right in the heels of the “La Bomba”, the beam hat with a half-meter-wide brake that has been seen on everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult behind the highly impractical hat that dominated social media has now sent another great creation down the catwalk – a beach bag in straw that is almost as large as the swimsuit model that wears it.
The orange raffia bag, edged with raffia linings and complemented with a white leather handle, was the most eye-catching creation of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at the fashion show in Paris.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags in clothing stores next summer – when the designer has had such a big impact it will be difficult to overlook the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language Skills are Essential for World Citizens
Scottish high schools continue to exhibit academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with an additional one-year outstanding exam results. These are supported by individual and joint success in sports, arts, music and other community activities.
These schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools, have more than 30,000 students across Scotland, and work hard to deliver the best school experience to both students and parents.
Primary schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their position as world citizens.
As an educational body that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we see that modern languages are still a popular and in demand choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the words come to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, the words reach his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we can’t just stick to English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s exam results, we see that languages are at the top of the table with the highest pass rates from primary schools.
A total of 68 percent of students studying foreign languages received the exam grade A.
The data, obtained from the 74 member schools of the board, showed that 72 per cent of students received the A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those who studied German, 69 per cent of those who studied French and 63 per cent of those who studied Spanish also received A.
This illustrates that schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a crucial skill children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as a professional choice are now valued at the same level as real sciences as natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics on the curriculum for primary schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 showed that for the reasons employers reported having trouble occupying a vacancy position, 17 percent could be attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important to prepare young people for a future career.
As more and more job opportunities require language skills, these skills become decisive in a globalized world.
If you have learned a second language, these lifelong skills will provide real benefits in the future, no matter what career you choose.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only two-digit language that could speak a number of participants (15 percent).
This is why investing in language learning is now crucial for today’s children.
Being able to speak more languages, especially those related to emerging economies, will give children better opportunities to find good jobs.
In Scotland if each school teaches in different languages.
Many schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach in the languages considered most valuable to the UK on the way to 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever interests your child, there will always be a variety of languages to choose from in high school, with teachers who are experts in this area.
Scottish high school schools aim to create a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future brings.
It cannot be denied in today’s global business environment that language is still crucial for the country’s future, and this must be reflected in teaching.
Modern languages should in fact be regarded as “international communication ability”.
Schools will continue to offer this opportunity, diversity and award for Scottish youth.
We have to do it right.

LeBron is set to make his Lakers debut in San Diego on Sunday.
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday’s pre-season opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he will play is still uncertain.
“There will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trundell wrote on Twitter that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked what plans he had for Lakers' pre-season sex game plan.
“I don’t need pre-season matches at this stage of my career,” he said.
Time for Trump’s West Virginia People’s Meeting, YouTube Channel
The President is launching a series of election meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It’s the first of Trump’s five planned referendums over the next week, including stops in cities where he has a lot of support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the confirmation mood for his elected Supreme Court candidate is pending, Trump aims to gain support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress as voters go to voting hours in November.
When is Trump’s West Virginia People’s Meeting tonight, and how can it be viewed online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled to start at 19:00 ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s West Virginia People’s Meeting online below via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss this week's hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of sexual assault. An expected confirmation mood is set to wait for up to a week while the FBI is investigating the case.
The main goal of all these referendums is to support Republicans facing a challenging election in November.
President Trump has therefore said that these five referendums over the coming weeks are aimed at “enrolling volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we move toward a busy campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
The evening's meeting, which is scheduled to take place at the Wesbanko Arena in Wheeling, could attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, and covered by the Pittsburgh press", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, a state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia’s Republican Senate candidate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the polls.
“It’s a good sign for Morrisey that the president has come to try to give him a boost in the polls,” Simon Haeder, an expert on political science at West Virginia University, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows fighting spirit to keep faith as they enter Sunday's singles game
After three unilateral sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes may have been exactly what this year’s Ryder Cup needed.
The momentum’s swinging pendulum is a completely invented sports concept, but still something players really believe in, especially in competitions like this.
Where do you think the momentum is now?
"They led with six points and now there are four, so we're probably carrying it with us as a bit of momentum," said Jordan Spieth as he left the track for the day.
Of course, Europe will have the advantage – they lead with four points and there are 12 left to play for.
But as Spieth says, the Americans feel that they have gotten some wind in their sails again, and they have good reason to feel inspired, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points out of four.
Spieth has delivered excellent games from tee to green, and leads by example.
The deep celebration screams increased as his round continued, and sank to a decisive putting to raise the match to a draw when he and Thomas were down two after two.
His putting, who won them the match at 15, was met with a similar scream – of the kind that shows that he still doesn’t think the American team is unlucky.
"We really just have to put all the cloths in and focus on our own match," Spieth said.
That’s all the players have now.
18 holes to make an impression.
The only players who have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who are undoubtedly the Ryder Cup’s great success story.
Europe’s unusual but lovely couples have four out of four and don’t put a foot in the wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only pair to avoid a bogey Saturday afternoon, and also avoided the bogey's Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
These results and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the lively crowd make it clear that they are Sunday’s biggest competitors, and there are no other players the audience would rather see secure a European victory as the sun sets over Le Golf National than Freetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time, in each of their holes.
However, it is too early to declare Europe the winner.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson easily hammered up with Sergio Garcia, the morning's fourballs hero, when he was partnering with Alex Noren.
After one bogey and two doubles during the first nine holes, the Spaniard and the Swede were so far behind that they had no chance of regaining the lead.
On Sunday, there is no help.
Fourballs and foursomes are very interesting to look closely due to the interaction between the pairs, the tips they give each other, the tips they don’t give, and how a strategy can turn in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far, and is far ahead of the last day, but this foursomes session also showed that Team USA has the fighting spirit of some, especially in the United States, has been missing.
Europe leads 10–6 at the start of the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a strong lead at the start of the Ryder Cups last day, after completing Sunday’s four-ball and four-somes matches with a 10–6 lead against the United States.
The brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two wins against a broken Tiger Woods, raising their score for Le Golf National so far to four points.
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn's European side, who struggles to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated America's unfortunate side in the morning's four-balls and won the series 3–1.
The United States gave more resistance in the foursomes and won two matches, but they were not allowed to take any of the lead.
Jim Furyk's side must earn eight points from Sunday's 12 singles games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, and he and Molinari – who together have been nicknamed “Molliwood” after a sensational weekend – are the only pair to have scored four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourball, they worked seamlessly to beat down Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who stayed through two games on Saturday, glimpsed occasionally, but has now lost 19 of his 29 games in fourballs and foursomes and seven consecutive.
Justin Rose, rested for the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stevensen in the foursomes and scored a 2&1 win against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are ranked number one and three worldwide.
But Europe did not get everything they wanted on this hot day with light breeze southwest of Paris.
Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth, who have won the majors three times, set the standard for the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They got a hard-hit 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs, and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in foursomes after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, a team has managed to recover after a four-point lead at the start of the single game, but as current holders only need Furyk’s side to achieve a draw to keep the trophy.
But after being the second best in two days, it doesn’t appear that they will be able to deliver a counterattack on Saturday.
North Korea 'no way' will agree to unilateral disarmament without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that continued sanctions strengthened distrust of the United States and that the country would in no way agree to unilaterally drop its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization’s annual General Assembly that North Korea has implemented “significant benevolence measures” over the past year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test area and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We have not seen any similar response from the United States," he said.
“Without trust in the United States, we have no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances, under no circumstances will we unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
Ri reiterated renowned North Korean complaints of Washington's resistance to a gradual nuclear disarmament, where North Korea is rewarded for gradual disarmament, but his declaration was significant because it did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament completely, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump issued in Singapore on June 12, at the very first meeting between a sitting president of the United States and a North Korean leader, where Kim pledged to work against “nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula” while Trump guaranteed North Korea’s security.
North Korea has called for a formal end to the Korean War that lasted from 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first release its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to reduce strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'nuclear disarmament first', lifting pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal by coercion, and even opposes 'the declaration of the end of the war'," Ri said.
“The belief that sanctions can force us to kneel is a dream for people who don’t know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions create further distrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump as the US leader stressed before the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae over the past five months, adding: “If the other party in this disarmament case were South Korea, rather than the United States, the Korean Peninsula’s nuclear weapons would not have been as secured as it is.”
However, the tone of Ris’ speech was very different from last year’s, when he told the UN General Assembly that an attack on the mainland U.S. with North Korea’s missiles was inevitable after Trump called Kim a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
After threatening to “completely destroy” North Korea last year, Trump stood in front of the UN this year praising Kim for being brave enough to take disarmament steps, but said much work remains, and the sanctions must remain in force until North Korea is nuclear-weaponed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn’t have a time frame for this, saying, “It doesn’t matter if it takes two years, three years, or five months.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures implemented.
But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that “the Security Council’s sanctions must still be enforced vigorously and without exception, until we have achieved complete, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to block the financing of Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said they had made progress, but just hours after North Korea accused him of making “gang-related claims.”
North Korea pledged in a meeting with Moon this month to shut down a missile site as well as a nuclear weapons facility if the United States took “similar measures.”
He said Kim had said that these “similar measures” he wanted were security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and measures to normalize relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard take courses to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year is aimed at helping students get more sleep by tackling the growing culture of bumping through the night with coffee drinks as fuel.
One academic found that students at the world’s best university often had no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, prepared the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He started the course after he gave a lecture on the impact sleep deprivation has on learning.
“After the lecture, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why has no one said this before?’
She said no one had ever told her how important sleep was, and it surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which starts this year, explains to students how important it is to have good sleep habits in order to be able to perform academically and athleticly, and for the general condition.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university's director of health care, said that the university decided to start the course after seeing students suffer from severe sleep deprivation.
The course, which lasts for one hour, has a series of interactive tasks.
In one part, there is a picture of a room in a bedroom, where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, running shoes and books and hear about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep, and how important it is with a sleep routine.
In another section, participants learn how long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A map of campuses with interactive icons makes participants think about their own daily routine.
“We are aware that this is not going to change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know about this, just as you have the right to know about the risk of smoking,” said Professor Czeisler.
There is still some pride in being able to puke all night, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students led to sleep deprivation was an increasing problem.
Enough and good sleep should be students’ “secret weapons” against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said – even as a means of weight gain, as lack of sleep puts the brain in hunger mode, leading to constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler prepare the course. He took one of the classes to the professor last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course inspired him to work for a course that was available for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all master’s students to take a similar study program before enrolling at the university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set an alarm for when to lie down as well as for when to get up, and that they should be aware of the harmful effects of blue light from electronic displays and LED lights. This type of light can disrupt the 24-hour rhythm and lead to sleep difficulties.
Livingston 1–0 Rangers: Goals of Many knock out Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another loss as Dolly Menga's goal beat Steven Gerrard's team 1–0 at Livingston.
The Ibrox side wanted to get their first win since February's 4–1 win at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as manager and since then left his eight points from Ladbrokes Premiership leaders Hearts.
Many beat to seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers were never able to match.
Rangers are now down in sixth place, while Livingston climbs up to third and is behind Hibernian on goal difference.
There may be more trouble in yeast for the Rangers after Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an object was thrown away from the public.
Gerrard made eight shifts on the team, which swept past Ayr and into the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, went for the same Livi 11 who took a point from Hearts last week, and he would have been happy about how his well-trained team beat the opponents.
The Rangers may have most possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with it while they had it.
They should have scored only two minutes into the game when Menga's first pass sent Scott Pittman through on Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed the chance.
A long freezing park of Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot at the target bar.
The Rangers took control, but it seemed that their game leaned more on hope than on belief in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos thought he should have a penalty kick after a quarter, when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson denied this.
The Rangers managed only two shots on goal in the first place, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no problems with Lassana Coulibaly's head and a narrow kick from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi’s opening in the 34th minute may have been against the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for the effort.
Again, the Rangers failed to handle a deep game from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his head cold when he selected Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent during the break, and the player's exchange gave immediate results when the winger sent to Morelos, but Kelly ran from his line to block.
But Livingston managed to get the players to play exactly the kind of match they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett catching up long ball after long ball.
Holt's side could have stretched the lead in the last round, but McGregor stood up against Jacobs before Lithgow headed from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton probably had a late claim for a penalty kick as he came into conflict with Jacobs, but again Thomson left.
The Almanac: The Inventor of the Geigerterterler
And now a page from the Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, was the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that led to the apparatus we now know as the geigertereller.
The geigerteller has been an important part of science since then, and also became part of popular culture through the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, with scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What in the world is that?”
Rogers: “It’s a geyser. It finds radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you turn on these headphones, you can hear the effect of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals.”
Evans: “Let’s say it’s making a sound now!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention to which he gave his name lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to “See” Cancer Cells
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to “See” Cancer Cells and Kill them
Vaccine Teaches Immune System to Recognize Cancer Cells as Part of Treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and changing them in a laboratory.
Cells can now “see” a protein that is common in many cancers, and then injected into the patient again.
A vaccine during testing has had promising results among patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who was given the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, experienced the ovarian cancer she suffered for more than 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein called HER2, which is typical for many cancers, and then injecting these cells into the patient again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “The results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "drives growth of different types of cancers", including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar method, in which immune cells were taken from the patient and “trained” to target cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West, wearing a MAGA hat, came with strong defense from Trump after the SNL appearance.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was turned into a studio on Saturday Night Live after a familiar performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for election in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, Ghost Town, wearing a Make America Great Again hat, he pushed out against the Democrats and repeated that he supported Trump.
“It happens so often that I talk to a white person and then he says, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s racist?’”
“If I was afraid of racism, I would have moved out of the United States a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's explanation to the Senate Judiciary Committee on the allegations of sexual abuse that Christine Blasey Ford presented.
Even though it wasn't broadcast, West's footage was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock wanted to ridicule West by posting the recording.
West also complained to the public that he had heard it in the back room about the choice of headwear.
“They bullied me.
They said, “Don’t go out there with that hat.”
But he bullied me!
And then they said that I don’t understand what reality is,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see that I understand what reality is?” he said, saying that he should “take me on the Superman cape, because then no one can tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Try the love.”
His comments were curved at least twice, and employees working at SNL looked embarrassed, Variety reported, where a staff member said, “The whole studio was deadly.”
West was brought in as the last minor replacement for singer Ariana Grande, when her boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many when he performed the song "I Love It" dressed as a Perrier water bottle.
West received support from the leader of the Conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of our bravest: THANK YOU FOR STANDING IN THE MASSES.”
But talkshower Karen Hunter tweeted that West is just “who he is and it’s absolutely amazing.”
“But I choose not to reward anyone by buying his music or clothes or supporting his ‘art’, which I think is cultivating and spreading ideology that is detrimental to society.
He's free.
We are, too,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that from now on he was "the creature formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and now follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Snoop Dogg has been named Snoop Lion. Then of course it is the late music glue Prince, who changed the name to a symbol and then the artist who was formerly known as Prince.
Suspected for attempted murder after knife-knife at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been tried for murder after a man was stabbed to death at a restaurant east of Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The defendants are expected to be prepared for the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The verdict will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington goes against "gifty masculinity"
Kit Harington is known for his role as the swordsman Jon Snow in HBO's violent fantasy series added to the Middle Ages, Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has gone out and criticized the stereotype of the macho hero and says such roles in films often make young men think they need to be tough to be respected.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said something went wrong and wondered how to tackle the problem of “toxic masculinity” in these <0x23>MeToo times.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones colleague Rose Leslie, also 31, said he was very interested in the theme.
“It worries me a lot at the moment – where did the masculinity go wrong?” he said.
“How have we raised men in view of the problems we see now?”
Kit believes that TV may be partly responsible for the increase in "toxic masculinity" due to the highly masculine roles.
He continued: “What is born, and what is allowed?
What is broadcast on TV and on the street, what is it that makes young boys feel that they have to cultivate precisely this side of being a man?
I think that’s one of the really big questions of our time – how can we change it?
For it is clear that something has gone wrong for young men.”
In the interview, he also admits that he won’t make any predecessors or successors of Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying he’s “finished with battlefields and horses.”
From November, Kit will play the lead in a remake of Sam Shepard True West. This is the story of a filmmaker and his brother, who is a burglar.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones is that he met his wife Rose.
“I met my wife during the recordings, so that way something good came out of it – my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, whom Kit's character Jon Snow is in love with, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China Reports 14% Increase in New Cases
China has reported an increase of 14% in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been affected in the country, health representative says.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases are transmitted via sex, marking a change from the previous.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in certain parts of China by infection through blood transfusions.
But the number of people who get HIV in this way is now close to zero, Chinese health professionals said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV infection through sex is an acute problem in China’s LGBT environment.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be high.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Much of the infection is due to insufficient protection during sex in these conditions.
Since 2003, the Chinese authorities have promised public access to HIV medicine as part of a measure to address the problem.
Maxine Waters Refuses Employee Leaked Data on Republican Senators, Filled with "Dangerous Lies" and "Conspiracy Theories"
A member of the House of Representatives, Maxine Waters, on Saturday dismissed allegations that members of her staff had posted the personal data of three Republican senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat insured by the allegations was made by “ultra-conservative” commentators and websites.
“Lies, lies, and more repugnant lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information reportedly included the home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a panel hearing in the Senate on the allegations of abuse against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address of the source behind the post was tracked to Waters' office and revealed information about a member of Waters' staff, according to Hill.
“This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and a real lie,” Waters continued.
“The members of my staff – who have been compromised on their identities, personal data and security as a result of these unfair and false accusations – had absolutely no responsibility for the leakage of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and a real lie.”
Waters' statement was quickly criticized online, among others by former White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is aggressive,” Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests she doesn't have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven’t done, they shouldn’t be aggressive.
They must not go to defense.
They must not question the prosecutor's motives.
They have to act calmly and calmly.”
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of appearing too aggressive during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate working to remove Waters in the midterm elections, also aired his thoughts on Twitter.
“Great – if that’s true,” he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had notified "relevant authorities and police of these false accusations".
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are disclosed,” she continued, “and that they are held responsible for all acts that are destructive and dangerous to each of my staff.”
Johnny English Strikes Again – Bloodthirsty Rowan Atkinson in Spy Parody
It has now become a tradition to look for Brexit interpretations in all new movies with a British slope and it seems to be relevant for this revival of the parody franchise Johnny English action comedy – which began in 2003 with Johnny English and resurrected in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will sarcastic self-satisfaction about how obviously hopeless we are to become the nation’s new exporter?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with his blunt eyes and rubber face has renewed his license to wreak havoc on it for the second time – his name says more than anything else that he is a clear and comic figure calculated on territories with non-English-speaking cinema audiences.
He is, of course, the stupid secret agent who despite his bizarre James Bond ambitions is a mix of Clouseau, a whistleblower Mr Bean, and a portion of the guy who contributes with one single note in the music team with firefighter theme during the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
He is also originally based on the role Atkinson played in the long-forgotten TV ads for Barclaycard; the travelling and international mystery monster that leaves chaos everywhere.
It’s one of the great moments of the last Johnny English journey.
I loved how Johnny English approached a helicopter in medieval equipment and the rotor blades cut his helmet.
Atkinson’s talent for physical comedy comes to its senses, but the humor feels rather bloody and strangely redundant, especially now that the “serious” brands like 007 and Mission Impossible willingly away have elements of comedy.
The humor seems to be more directed at children than adults, and for me, Johnny English’s fades aren’t as inventive and spicy as the silent movie lions in Mr Bean.
The current premise is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain’s supersecret web network of spies and revealed the identity of all the British agents in the field, to the horror of the vigilante agent – a regrettably small role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the last drop of a prime minister, a pompous and depressed figure already undergoing a complete crisis of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does a very good job with this like-Theresa-May role, but the script doesn’t give her much to work with.
Intelligence advisers tell her that since every active spy has been revealed, she must pick up some of the retired.
And that means the cunning Johnny English, who now works as a teacher at a snob establishment, but gives informal instruction in secret intelligence. There are some funny sequences here, when English offers a rock academy for espionage.
English is snapped back to Whitehall for a quick orientation and reunited with his old, troubled aide Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, intertwined with a submarine commander, a hysterical upper class role where Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin's style of ruining everything up on queen's quest is back, where they confront Olga Kurylenko's amazing women fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the prime minister is seduced by the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's cyber problems: the illusory Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey with a freaky side jump: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a stunning French restaurant. They create chaos while hiding on board Volta's luxury yacht; and English triggers pure anarchy as he tries to use a VR headset to get acquainted in Volta's house.
All the stops are really being pulled out before the last sequence, but even so kind and noisy it is, so there’s a lot that reminds me of children’s TV with all the stuff.
Pretty mediocre, all of it.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but think: can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where he really gets to use his talent?
Labour denies they are preparing plans to allow British workers to work for four days, but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is set to consider a radical plan that will give the British a four-day work week – but get paid for five.
The party apparently wants business leaders to spend savings on the revolution with artificial intelligence by giving workers an extra day of the week off.
This will give employees a three-day weekend, while also earning the same pay.
Sources say the idea fits into the party's economic agenda and plans to move the country in favor of workers.
Trade unions support the transition to four-day week so that workers can also enjoy the benefits of the new economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: “A political review is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but the four-day week is an ambition that fits the party’s desire to let the pendulum swing for the benefit of the workers – in addition to the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
Labour will not be the first to support such an idea. Green Party promised a four-day week during the campaign before the 2017 parliamentary election.
The idea, however, is not supported by the whole Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: “A four-day week is not the party’s policy, and is not something that is being assessed by the party.”
Labour's financial policy spokesman, John McDonnell, used the Labour Conference last week to deepen his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from “faceless directors” and “profiters” of public service providers.
Shadow Chancellor’s plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies are at risk of not getting back the entire stock market because a Labour government can make “deductions” from perceived injustice.
He also confirmed plans to place employees in company boards and create employee fund to transfer 10% of the equity to private sector companies to employees, who can get an annual return of <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy Tell '60 Minutes' About Kavanaugh's FBI Grant Could Make They Change Their Mind
The FBI scrutiny of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question of whether the agency’s findings could cause some Republican senators to change their minds.
In an interview sent on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could uncover something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open to it than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
“I said at the opening of the hearing that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I contacted him after the charges came out and asked, “Did you do that?”
He was firm, confident, unambiguous.”
Graham’s voice, however, seems to be carved in stone.
“I’ve decided about Brett Kavanaugh, and in that case it must have been a striking finding,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett denied it vigorously," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“None of those she mentioned could confirm it.
That's 36 years ago.
I don’t think anything new will change that.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it contributed to the fight against poverty?
This Saturday, New York is hosting the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an impressive list of stars to perform and an equally impressive mission; eradicating the world’s poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival, which is now in its seventh year, will cause thousands of people to flow to the big grass in Central Park, not only to experience sizes like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness around the event’s real goal of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is a further development of the Global Poverty Project, an international action group that hopes to fight poverty by getting more people to work actively against poverty.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you’re willing to pay for a VIP ticket), participants had to perform a number of tasks, or “actions”, such as volunteer work, send an email to a world leader, take a phone or in other meaningful ways to raise awareness about their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been when it is now only 12 years left to achieve this goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to get people to fight for change, or just another case of so-called “clickivism” – that people feel they make a big contribution by signing an online campaign or tweeting?
Global Citizen says they have registered more than 19 million “actions” from supporters since 2011, with a wealth of different goals.
They say these actions have contributed to making world leaders declare commitments and policies equivalent to more than <0x24>37 billion that will improve the situation for more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group was able to display 390 engagements and announcements as a result of their actions, of which at least <0x24>10 billion has already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the secured funding so far has had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and entrepreneurs to “help children to make full use of their potential,” promising to give Rwanda <0x24>35 million to help eradicate malnutrition in the country after receiving over 4700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” Ambassador of Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions in the UK to get better nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition measures.
In response to one of the most common questions on the website, “What makes you think that we can eradicate extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen replied: “It will be a long and difficult road – sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the important civil rights and anti-apartheid movements ahead of us, we will succeed because we stand together stronger.
Janet Jackson, from Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists performing at this year's event in New York, which will be led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. may use navy as ‘block’ to prevent Russian energy exports
Washington may “if necessary” resort to the navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria – especially when operating at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think the reason they’re in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate energy just like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern flank of Europe,” he said.
And according to the speaker, there are always ways and means to deal with this.
“The United States has through the Navy the ability to ensure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, blockades to ensure that energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants at the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that profiles itself as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s ways of interacting with Russia and Iran, noting that they are far along the way the same.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuel,” he said, referring to Russia as “one trick pony” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements came after the Trump administration was on a round trip to strengthen exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe. They want to replace Russia, the by far the cheapest option for European consumers.
Employees in the Trump administration, including the president himself, therefore tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" project The Northern European Gas Pipeline 2, which according to Trump made Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North European gas pipeline worth <0x24>11 billion, which is expected to double its existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s ardent opposition to the project is motivated only for financial reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we have the same view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose a supplier,” Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. energy minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The United States has faced opposition from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitments to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organization, BDI, has asked the United States to stay away from the EU’s energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have major problems with third countries that interfere in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, the head of the BDI after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will “think seriously” about her 2020 presidential nomination, Massachusetts senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would “think seriously” if she would run for president after the midterm elections.
During a voter summit in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would quit.
“It’s time for women to come to Washington and fix the shocked government, and that includes a woman at the top,” she told The Hill.
“After November 6th, I will seriously consider whether to run for president.”
Warren attacked President Donald Trump during the election summit and said he "guided the country in the wrong direction".
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with democracy,” she said.
Warren has been open in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “Of course, we need an FBI poll before a vote.”
However, a poll published on Thursday shows that a majority of Warren’s own voters do not believe she should run for office in 2020.
58% of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not be silent, according to an opinion poll from the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% supported her candidacy.
The poll showed higher support for former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% supporting a possible candidacy and 48% against it.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed in connection with a possible candidacy in 2020 include Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin points to Track Palin's PTSD during Trump's Electoral Meeting
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after serving in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he’s going through after coming home, I have in common with other families experiencing the consequences of PTSD and some of the vulnerability our soldiers have with them,” she told the audience at an election event for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest “the elephant in space” and said of his son and other war veterans: “They come home slightly changed, they come home cured, they come home wondering if this is the respect for what their soldiers and pilots and all other members of the military have contributed to the country.”
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, scoffing at a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while he was drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for police in Wasilla.
18 states and D.C. support testing of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal trial of a new policy in the United States that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and D.C. issued an orientation from amicus curiae (a friend of the court) in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged politics, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union instituted in August against the federal police has not been disclosed.
She claimed that her partner "and his violent gang members" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers to the United States, as nations that have widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a decision in 2014 by the Court of Appeal for Immigrants that gave undocumented immigrants who fled domestic violence the law to apply for asylum.
State Attorney Karl Racine in the District of Columbia said in a statement Friday that the new policy "disappears from many decades of state, federal and international law".
“Federal law requires that all asylum claims be determined on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a ban is contrary to that principle,” the Amicus Curiae statement said.
The lawyers further argued in the orientation that the policy that denied access to immigrants hurts the U.S. economy and says there is a high likelihood that they will become entrepreneurs and “contribute with the necessary workforce.”
Justice Minister Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges no longer to give asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political view,” Sessions said in a June 11 statement.
Asylum was never meant to reduce all the problems – even all the serious problems – that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue in Palu – death tolls double in search for survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
“It was very exciting,” says 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, while comforting her fever-sick son at an evacuation center in the crowded city of Palu.
“You see ambulances all the time bringing the dead.
Clean water is lacking.”
Residents could be seen coming to ruined homes and lightening through water damaged assets in an attempt to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, which were damaged in the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, are sitting outside Palus military hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to ongoing heavy aftercare.
He gets tears in his eyes when he recounts how it felt when the violent earthquake shook the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I was clutched by the wall that broke down, I think,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that the family was in town to attend a wedding.
I heard my wife cry for help, and then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of “Harassment” with “Propaganda Ads”
A week after a Chinese public newspaper ran a four-page ad in an American newspaper that assessed the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the annex China Daily paid for entering the Des Moines Register — the best-selling newspaper in Iowa — after accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. Congressional elections on November 6, an accusation China rejects.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to influence the U.S. election marked a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China, U.S. officials said.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to use ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are locked in an escalating trade war that has led to rounds of new tariffs on each other’s imports.
China’s early penalty tariffs in the trade war were to hit export companies in states like Iowa, which supported Trump’s Republican party, Chinese and US experts reported.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former Iowa governor who is a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has affected U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a reader post in Sunday’s Des Moines Register: “China is now stepping up the harassment by running propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“By spreading this propaganda, the Chinese authorities are harnessing the freedom of expression and the open press that we enjoy in America to put a paid ad in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“As a contrast – at the newspaper kiosk on the street here in Beijing you will not find many divergent opinions and will not be able to experience real reflections among ordinary Chinese around China’s problematic economic course, given that the media is under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added: “One of China’s largest newspapers rejected the offer to publish” his article, even though he did not disclose which newspaper it was.
Republicans frighten women voters before midterm elections with Kavanaugh farewell, analysts warn
As many top Republican politicians support and defend Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has received multiple charges of sexual assault against himself, analysts warn that they will receive a counter-reaction, especially from women, in the upcoming local elections.
The feelings around this have been very strong, and most Republicans have already given signs that they want to move on with the vote.
These things cannot be withdrawn,” Grant Reeher, a professor of science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona)'s proposal for a last-second FBI scrutiny will be enough to calm angry voters.
“Women will not forget yesterday’s events – they will not forget tomorrow and not in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the Progressive Group MoveOn last Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters sang “November is coming!” as they protested in the hallways of the Senate as Republicans who controlled the Judiciary Committee chose to proceed with Kavanaugh’s nomination despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony, Mic reported.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to explode,” Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news site.
“People say it’s already been high, it’s true.
But it could be higher, especially among women uncertain voters in the suburbs and younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29, who often do not vote even if they dislike the president.
Even before Ford’s public testimony gave a detailed description of the allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts thought it would be a counter-reaction if the Republicans forced through the appointment.
"This has become a blessing for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote or final approval or Kavanaugh being put into action – it’s also about how Republicans have handled this and how they have treated it,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that promotes the election of democratic candidates, told the news channel.
The Americans, however, seem to be somewhat divided over whom to believe in the mouths of Fords and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a small majority in favor of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents were completely or quite convinced of Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they were completely or quite convinced of Kavanaugh’s production.
In addition, 38% said they were quite or completely convinced that Kavanaugh lied under his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After Flake's release, the FBI is investigating Ford's allegations as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford explained to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh was drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate exposed her genitals while at a party during her studies at Yale in the 1980s.
The creator of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, is launching a launch to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest technology legend’s project, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
On Solid, users can choose where their data will be stored and which people have access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the purpose was “world domination”.
“We have to do it now,” he said about the start.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “personal data warehouse online” or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, worklists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser at a time.
What is unique about personal data storage online is that it is entirely up to the user who should have access to that type of information.
The company calls it “personal authorization through data”.
The idea behind Inrupt is according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, that the company should provide resources, process and relevant expertise to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some hired developers on contract to work with the project, and a group of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team were not talking to Facebook and Google about introducing something completely new or not, which would make their business models completely reworked overnight.
“We don’t ask for your permission.”
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an important voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Although he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will still be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about the next era of the net,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Victoria Cross recipients of World War I
The only priest in the English church to be awarded a Victoria Cross during World War I as a warrior was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant-Colonel and priest Bernard Vann were awarded the honorary award on 29 September 1918 at the Battle of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he was awarded the highest British military award.
A memorial stone was discovered by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was a “great symbolism” that the stone would be discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s award-winning achievement.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Water led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29 – “through very thick fog and under strong protection from field guns and machine guns.”
Later he crashed into the shooting line and led the line “with great courage” forward before storming a field gun on his own and knocking out three of the divisions.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I knew I could never live up to, but something that makes me humble.”
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid down a crown after the parade, which was headed by the Brentwood Imperial Corps.
Michael Vann said he “feels very honored to play a role in the parade,” adding: “The tactility of a real hero is demonstrated by the support that comes from many people.”
MMA fans were up all night watching the Bellator 206 martial arts program, instead they got Peppa pig
Imagine that you’ve been awake all night to watch the packed Bellator 206, just to discover that you won’t be able to see the main game.
The participant from San Jose managed through 13 games, including six on the main card and was shown live through the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet each other, spectators in the UK were sitting to mutter when the picture suddenly showed Peppa pig.
Some were less impressed after staying awake until early morning to watch the match.
A follower on Twitter described the transition to the children's program as "a sort of sick joke".
“It’s state regulation that it’s not appropriate to send such programs at 6:00, so they had to transfer to children’s programs,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa pig, yes!".
Bellator’s CEO, Scott Coker, said they will work on the broadcast schedule to include viewers in Britain in the future.
“I think we can figure it out for the rematch,” Coker said.
“But it’s 6 a.m. on Sunday there, and we won’t be able to solve this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me - when we passed, there were many messages going back and forth, and they were not exactly of the kind.
We tried to solve it and thought it was a technical failure.
But that was not it, it was a matter of authority.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We will reduce from six to five games – which we usually send – and we tried to stretch far for the fans, but tip over.
It’s an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior to sexuality
Olympic stuntman Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of inferiority towards everyone because of his sexuality – but that gave him the motivation he needed to succeed.
The 24-year-old says it wasn’t until high school he realized that “he wasn’t like everyone else.”
In the first Desert Island Discs program on Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he stood up for the rights of the gays to give others "hope".
He also said that being a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.
The regular program manager for the traditional program, Kirsty Young, is expected to be gone for a few months due to illness.
Daley appeared as a little missing on Laverne's first show and said he felt "less valued" than anyone else he grew up with because "it was not socially acceptable to like both boys and girls".
“To this day, it is these feelings of being inferior and different that have been the real motivation and have me the strength and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, so he didn’t disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
He is twice a bronze winner at the Olympics and has become a highly profile LGBT ambassador. He used his participation at this year's Community Games in Australia to appeal for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he stands out because he feels he’s lucky to be able to live openly without negative consequences and want to give others “hope”.
The three-time World Champion said that the fact that he fell in love with a man – US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – “surprised me.”
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you're going through so much at such a young age" - he attended his first Olympics when he was 14, and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" had been changed.
“If you asked me last year, it was all about me just having to win a gold medal,” he said.
“You know what, there are bigger things than gold medals in the Olympics.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
The son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept him to die, and one of the last things he asked about was whether they had gotten tickets to London 2012 – since he wanted to sit in the first row.
“I couldn’t tell him he wouldn’t live long enough to sit in the first row,” he said.
“I held his hands when he stopped breathing and it wasn’t until he actually stopped breathing and was dead that I finally realized he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life – drowning in front of a home audience at the Olympics, the best feeling ever,” he said.
It also inspired his first song choice – Proud of Heather Small – which meant a lot to him in the pre-Olympic race and still gives him goose skin.
Desert Island Discs runs on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Formsvake Mickelson Taken To The Ryder Cup Tournament On Saturday
American Phil Mickelson wants to break a record on Sunday as he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he has to get in shape if it’s not going to be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennium for the impressive 12th time, was placed on the bench by team captain Jim Furyk before Saturday's fourball and foursome games.
Instead of being at the center of the event, as he had been so often for the United States, the five-time major-winner divides the day between being a hero and working with his game on the rank in hopes of fixing what is crooking.
The 48-year-old has never had the best turn, even at the top of his career and is not in perfect shape for the tight Le Golf National, where the long rough area still penalizes mischievous blows.
And if the track itself isn’t scary enough, Mickelson, in his ninth game on Sunday, meets British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with novice Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, with four points below before the 12 singles games, get a successful start, Mickelson’s game can prove to be crucial.
Fury expresses confidence in her husband, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully understood what role he had today, gave me a blow on my back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready the next day," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence.
He is a “Hall of Famer” and has contributed so much to these teams earlier, and this week.
I didn’t think he was going to play two games.
I saw more for myself, but that’s how it ended, and that’s how we thought we had to do it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for most played Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
It could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never completely reached his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, but Furyk said his participation added some intangible values to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, funny and likes to have sex with others. He’s a great guy to have in the warehouse,” he explained.
“I think the younger players had fun trying against him this week too, and it was fun to see.
He gives more than just the game.”
European team captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn knows that his great leadership will soon disappear
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant lead at the entrance to the last day’s singles game in the Ryder Cup can quickly turn into an unpleasant round.
The Danish debuted in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a side led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but cared for the victory with the least possible margin, 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You still remind yourself that we had a great leadership at Valderrama; we had a great leadership at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only so far,” said Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, photographed after seeing Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday led 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So the story will show me and everyone else on the team that this is not over.
You'll give everything tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This is not over until you get the points on the board.
We have one goal, and that’s to try to win this trophy, and that’s where the focus lies.
I’ve always said that I’m focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we’re very aware of what’s on the other side – the best golfers in the world.”
Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn is very pleased with how his players have managed on the tough golf course and adds: “I couldn’t do better.
Tomorrow is a new challenge.
Tomorrow, the individual achievements are at the center, and it’s something completely different.
It’s great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you’re out there alone, your achievements as a golfer are tested to the fullest.
It’s the message you have to convey to the players, that they have to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner, and he must also go out and get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, opponent Jim Furyk will try to get his players to perform better individually than they did as partners. The exception is Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three out of four points.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of the great upheavals the last day. He was on the winning team at Brookline before he ended up losing when Europe performed the "miracle of Medinah".
I remember every damn word of it,” he said in response to the question about how Ben Crenshaw, the team captain in 1999, had knocked down with his players at the entrance to the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to have a good start, like the one we experienced at Brookline, as we saw at Medinah.
When the momentum starts to go in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We then arrange our setup and send out the people the way we feel, you know, we're trying to create something magical tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the game and challenge Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other Europeans in the top half of the game sequence.
"I bet on this group of men in that order because I think it stands all the way," Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn said of his choice of singles.
Germany's new warships are delayed once again
The German Navy’s latest frigate should have been completed in 2014 to replace old warships from the days of the Cold War, but it will not happen until early next year due to failing systems and galloping costs, local media reported.
The completion of the Rhineland-Palatinate, the pilot ship of the all-new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quoted a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to have been delivered to the navy in 2014, but the major problems after delivery pursued the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class navy ordered back in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is agreed that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – it should be possible to use the latest frigates for up to two years away from the home port.
Slow delays, however, mean that the advanced warships — they were told to give Germany strength at sea — will already be outdated before they are put into service, Die Zeit reports.
The fateful F125 frigate created headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media mentioned a number of important "software and hardware defects" that rendered the warship useless in a combat mission.
The software defects were particularly important since ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were to be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the crew on the older fregates of the Bremen class.
It was also revealed that the ship has a huge excess weight, which reduces performance and limits the navy's ability to make upgrades in the future.
The 7,000-ton heavy "Rhineland-Palatinate" is estimated to be twice as heavy as similar ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the price tag for the entire project – including training of the crew – has also begun to become a problem.
It is claimed to have reached a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion – from the original <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems surrounding the new frigates are particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany’s naval force is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German government's defence committee, confirmed that the navy was in fact "empty for usable ships".
The official said the problem has escalated over time because old ships were outdated, but no new ships arrived.
He regrets that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be used by the navy.
The National Trust steals the secret life of the flag mouse
New research carried out at a land estate in the Scottish Highlands will reveal how flag mice use the landscape in the hunt for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help design future conservation measures.
The study by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common bats and dwarf bats as well as brown eagles and water bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed out at important locations around the property to track flag mouse activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also perform mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Experts’ sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the flagging mosquitoes and which species do what.
Then a habitat map and a report will be prepared to create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important to the bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will be included in the decision on what measures to implement, such as the planting of beets and how to best care for the forest for bats and other associated species.
The population of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined considerably over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and construction work that affect juvenile areas and habitat confinement.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a risk, the same with fly paper and certain chemically treated building materials as well as attacks from house rigs.
Flaggermouse is not blind.
But because of their night hunting habits, they are more useful to the ears than to the eyes when it comes to catching swap.
They use advanced echolocalization to find insects and obstacles along the way when they fly.
NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes flag mice very seriously.
They have ten skilled experts who regularly carry out surveys, mapping of juvenile sites and sometimes rescue work.
The organization has also established Scotland’s first and only own flag mouse reserve at Threave land estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s ten flag mouse species.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal territory for them.
“Here at Threave we have a perfect area for flag mouse,” he says.
“We have the old buildings, a lot of old trees and the ideal habitat.
But there’s still a lot we don’t know about bats, so the work we do here and at other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive.”
He stresses how important it is to map the flag mice before maintenance is carried out on a property since the unwarranted destruction of a single juvenile site can kill up to 400 females and young people, and perhaps exterminate an entire local population.
Flagger mice are protected, and it is illegal to kill them, harass or disturb them or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish employee of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help in the work.
She says: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many species we simply don’t know how the populations are doing.”
Ronaldo rejects rape allegations while lawyers will sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has described the rape allegations against him as “fake news” and says people “desire fame” by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The attacker for Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is accused of paying her <0x24>375,000 in return for keeping close about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
When he spoke in a live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers a few hours after the charges were reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo rejected the charges as “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news,” said five times the winner of the Golden Ball in the camera.
“They want fame by using my name.
It's normal.
They want fame by giving me my name, but that’s part of the job.
I’m a happy man and I’m fine,” the footballer added with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the allegations, which they have called “an unacceptable representation of suspicion in the private sphere,” according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz says the footballer will demand compensation for “injuries to an extent corresponding to the severity of the breach, which is likely to be one of the most serious violations of privacy in recent years.”
The alleged incident is said to have taken place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga are reported to have returned to the footballer's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents submitted to the Clark County District Court.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99% a good man" who was failed by that "one percent".
The documents show that Ronaldo has confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that photos of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later they filed outside the court because she was "afraid of revenge" and was also concerned about "being publicly hanged".
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to put aside the conspiracy because she is still traumatized after the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of moving from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged abuse, and this summer moved to Italian Juventus on a contract worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: Britain 'will mourn forever' loss of car manufacturers
Britain "will mourn forever" if it loses its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "concerning" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at the Burnaston plant near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the consequences of delayed border crossings in a possible Brexit without a deal could mean fewer jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyotas Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
“If the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, I think we will see production at our factory stop,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s chief executive officer at Burnaston.
Other British manufacturers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement as to how trade across borders will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW says it will close the Mini factory at Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is whether the car manufacturers say supply chain risks in a possible no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is operated on the basis of “order as needed”, and it arrives every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made on order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29, there could be a stay at the border, which the industry says could lead to delays and lack of parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to store more than one day of inventory at the Derbyshire factory, the company said, and thus will stop production.
Clark said Theresa May's Brexit plan for further ties with the EU is "precisely tailored to avoid such checks at the border".
“We need to have a deal, we want to get the best deal that will make us, as I say, not only enjoy success at the moment, but that we are taking advantage of this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today.
“The message, not only from Toyota but also from other car manufacturers, is that we must definitely be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production will be halted, but warned that rising costs in the long run will reduce the factory’s competitiveness and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the trade union leader at the factory, said that members are becoming increasingly concerned: “My experience suggests that when these jobs disappear, they will never return.”
A government spokesman said: “We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, the White House says
Donald Trump's fateful meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could be "deferred to another week" as the fight around Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House reported on Sunday.
Rosenstein is supervising special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, relations between Trump aides and Russia, and possible obstruction of the president’s judicial exercise.
The question of whether Trump will dismiss the Deputy Justice Minister or not, thereby threatening Mueller’s independence, has been raised during the speculations in Washington for many months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times wrote that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of recording talks with Trump and trying to remove the president on the basis of the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last month he went to the White House, while it was reported that he was resigning.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations at the time in New York, would take place on Thursday.
Trump said he "would rather let go" to kick Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid colliding with the Senate Judiciary Committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both witnessed.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh, further postponing a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, attended Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: “A date for the meeting was not set, and it could be this week, but I realized it could be a week’s postponement because of everything that happens to the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see, and I’m always busy keeping the press up-to-date.”
Some journalists will contest this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Program host Chris Wallace asked about the cause.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not due to the reluctance of TV reporters to “self-government,” although she added: “I do not disagree that they are self-governing.”
She then suggested that the contact between Trump and the press would be more frequent.
“The president is asking more questions than any previous president,” she said, adding without providing evidence: “We have looked at the numbers.”
There will still be press conferences, Sanders said, but “if the press gets the chance to ask the President of the United States questions directly, it will definitely be better than talking to me.
“We’re trying to get it done often, and you’ve seen that we’ve done it often in the last few weeks, and it’s going to replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open events or press conferences when visiting important people.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York this week, the president showed the possible cause, when he took a solo run and sometimes had a strange behavior in front of a crowd of reporters.
Health Secretary Writes to EU Workers at NHS Scotland on Brexit Concerns
The health secretary has written to the EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS (State Health Service) to express the country’s gratitude and a desire for them to remain after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to cover the costs of applying for a residence and work permit for EU citizens working in their public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “Negotiations between the UK and the EU on exit have taken place throughout the summer and are expected to land on a solution for the autumn.
But the British government has also stepped up the preparations for a possible scenario without an agreement.
I understand this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
I will therefore reiterate now how much I value the efforts of each individual employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and beyond, add valuable experience and expertise that strengthens and improves the work of healthcare for the best of the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we sincerely hope you will stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Defence player at the Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury during Saturday's 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ reported in the Tennessean newspaper.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before the first round was over.
"He came out on the sideline and just collapsed there," Reed said.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before they placed him on a bar and took him back for further examination.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no information on the type/range of injury yet" and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, is in her first season with Tennessee State after transitioning from Illinois.
He had five tackles on Saturday before finishing the game, giving a total of 18 tackles for his season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when buying property in the UK. According to new Tory plans, the extra money will be spent to help the homeless
The change will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s plan to attract young voters
The document fee increase will be collected from those who do not pay tax in the UK
Experts at the Ministry of Finance expect it to increase to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help homeless people
Theresa May will today announce that foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when buying property in the UK – and the extra money will be spent to help the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s plan to attract young voters with promise to offer cheaper housing and frame high-income groups.
The document fee increase will be imposed on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK. The extra money will strengthen the government’s action to remedy the situation of the homeless.
The surplus – which comes in addition to the current document fee, including the higher rate introduced two years ago on housing number two and housing purchases for rent – can be as much as 3%.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are purchased by non-UK residents, which increases prices and makes it harder for first-time buyers to get their foot in the housing market.
Many wealthy areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “small towns” because of the many foreign buyers who mostly reside outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a reduction in the document fee to help more young people own their own home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping housing prices high by buying up land without using it, and demanded that Theresa May have to reject quotas on affordable housing to solve Britain’s “scary housing policy.”
Jeremy Corbyn has announced a number of proposed housing reforms, including rental controls and an end to unfounded drafts.
He also wants to give municipal governments more power to build new homes.
“Last year, I said that I would devote my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream – that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means finding solutions for our broken housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and create a life here.
However, it may not be as easy for people who do not live in the UK, and also foreign-based companies, to buy homes as it is too hard working British citizens.
For many people, the dream of owning a home has become too far away, and the unworthy situation for the homeless persists.”
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland"
Sunderland’s boss, Jack Ross, says his “final goal” is to become Scotland’s manager sooner or later.
The 42-year-old Scot is delighted with the challenge of reviving the club in the northeast, which currently holds third place in League One, three points below the top.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a footballer.
I got a B-caps and that's it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportssound.
“But I was often with my father and saw Scotland on the Hampden as a child, and there is always something that draws me back.
However, that opportunity would only come if I succeeded in the club’s confusion.”
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he was not anxious to follow such established names in the big club, and has previously rejected approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me at the moment will be measured if I can get the club back in the Premier League."
“Based on the structure and facilities of this club, they undoubtedly belong to the Premier League,” he said.
It’s not an easy task to get it there, but I’ll probably just consider myself having succeeded here if I get the club back there.”
Ross has only been in the lead for three years, after a period as assistant manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month short appearance in Hearts' coaching staff.
Subsequently, he helped Alloa recover from downhill to the third division and helped St Mirren from the edge of downhill to win the championship title the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was probably a real road break,” he recalls when he took over the leadership of Alloa.
“I really thought leadership was the right thing for me, more right than playing.
It sounds weird since I did well, created a reasonable income from it and experienced some nice highlights.
Soccer can be tough.
There are many things you need to get through on a weekly basis.
I’m progressing through it in terms of stress and pressure at work, but the management feels right for me.
I always wanted to lead, and now I do. It feels like the most comfortable thing I’ve ever known in my adult life.”

This summer’s heatwave has strengthened revenues for Britain’s hard pressed pubs, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars experienced a sales increase of 2.7% in July – while revenues for restaurants fell 4.8%, the figures show.
Peter Martin, a CGA business consultant, who summarized the figures, said: “Continuing sunshine and England’s unexpectedly long participation in the World Cup made July follow a similar pattern as last June, when pubs rose 2.8%, except that restaurants were hit even harder.
The fall of 1.8% in restaurant turnover in June only worsened in July.
Drink-based pubs and bars had the best result, but an increase that was stronger equally-for-like than that of restaurants dropped.
Pubs with food served also had difficulty with the sun, although it was not as dramatic as for the resting-car drivers.
It seemed like people just wanted to drink.
For chain-based pubs and bars, turnover increased by 6.6% that month, with food service dropping by 3%".
Paul Newman, analyst at the RSM hotel and restaurant industry, said: “These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and major sporting and social events are still the most important factors in terms of turnover on the outdoor market.
It’s no surprise that restaurant groups are still having a hard time, and a revenue drop of 4.8% year-on-year will be particularly painful at the top of ongoing cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food service companies, and the time will show if the more moderate temperatures we had in August will provide an awaited breathing space.”
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in rollouts of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, industry turnover controller for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the UK, collects and analyzes the results from 47 operating groups, with a total turnover of <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and is the established industry standard.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
One in five children – some are just 11 years old – have secret social media accounts that they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed pages of “fake Insta.”
The news has raised concerns about the sharing of sexual content.
20% of students say they have a “main account” that they show to their parents.
One in five children – some are only 11 years old – create social media accounts that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in “fake Insta” accounts – a reference to photo sharing pages on Instagram.
The news has raised concerns about the sharing of sexual content.
20% of students said they had an innocent “main account” that they refer to their parents, while they had other secret accounts.
A mother who came across the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenage girl who urged others to “violete me.”
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Rectors Conference (HMC) for private schools, revealed that 40% of 11 to 18-year-old students had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC CEO Mike Buchanan said: “It’s scary that so many young people are tempted to create websites where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle to be ‘the voice of athletes’ on Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of Scottish Athletics and has a non-executive role in the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most decorated sportswoman, and President Ian Beattie described the event as a great opportunity for those leading the sport to gain insights into her extensive experiences on the international level over the past ten years.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and global athletics community, and we are confident that athletes in Scotland will benefit from getting her on board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I’m excited to act as a voice for athletes, and I hope I have a lot to contribute to guiding sport in Scotland.”
The American won 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and has a total of four Olympic gold medals. She is now a regular BBC expert, and after a temporary ischemic attack she was unable to go.
She wrote on Twitter: “A month ago today I got a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will show if I want to be restored and to what extent.
It’s been hard work, but I’m fine again and I’ve learned how to walk again, and today I’m doing agility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!”
Breast pump ad that compares mothers with cows splits the opinion online
A breast pump company has split the online audience with an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers with cows being milked.
To mark the launch of what is said to be “the world’s first silent breast pump that is carried close to the body,” Elvie, the technology-based consumer goods company, released a fresh and flirting, music video-inspired ad to show the freedom the new pump gives active mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a pond full of tall cows to a song with the following lyrics: "Yes, I'm milking myself, but you can't see any tail" and "In case you didn't realize it, this isn't jury, it's my tits."
The choir continues: “Pump it out, pump it out, I feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my bowls.”
However, the ad, which is published on the company’s Facebook page, has created a storm on the web.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom say it is the “greatness” of the dairy industry.
“Very bad decision to use cows to advertise for this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and feed to produce milk, but their babies are taken from them a few days after birth.”

Another commented: “Obviously traumatic for both mother and baby.
But – hey, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?”
Another added: “For a failed ad.”
Another defends the ad. A woman admitted that she thinks the song is “incredibly funny.”
“I think it’s a great idea.
I wish I had one if I were still breastfeeding.
The pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
“This is a great product,” he wrote.
Another commented: “This is a funny ad aimed at mothers who pump (often in the workplace or toilets) and feel like “cows.”
This is not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they have all danced with the discreet pump in the bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who pump themselves say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or hoses and gets a nice place in a breastfeeding bra, so women have the freedom to move, hold the baby and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, commented: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing parallels between active women and dairy cows, we wanted to set the spotlight on breast pumping and all the challenges, while at the same time showing in an entertaining and recognizable way the incredible sense of freedom the new pump provides.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has created headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a two-child mom appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to a tent camp on the Texas border secretly
The number of migrant children detained has gone hand in hand even though the monthly border crossing has remained relatively stable, in part because tough rhetoric and policies imposed by the Trump administration have made it harder to place children with supporters.
Traditionally, most supporters themselves have been undocumented immigrants, and have been afraid to ruin their own chances of staying in the country by stepping forward and claiming a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential supporters and other adults in the household had to enter fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people applying for support for single minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no previous criminal records.
“Almost 80% of people who are either supporters or members of the supporters’ household are illegal in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminal immigrants.
So we continue to pursue these people,” says Albence.
The police are trying to deal with the children faster and have introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within one month of being arrested, and not 60 days that was the previous standard, according to reception staff.
Many will be produced via videoconferencing instead of meeting up personally to lead their case on residence permit for an immigration judge.
Those considered as unjustified asylum seekers will be deported immediately.
The longer children remain in custody, the greater the risk of anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbreaks or attempted escape, according to reception staff and reports that have appeared in the system in recent months.
Lawyers said these concerns have grown at a larger facility like Tornillo, where struggling children are more easily overlooked due to the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to the tent camp without getting enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to friends can aggravate traumas that many people are already struggling with.
Syria calls on U.S., French and Turkish ‘occupation powers’ to withdraw immediately
In a speech in the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces had stayed illegally on Syrian soil under the cover of fighting terrorism and "will be treated afterwards".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that “the war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions are fleeing.
He said Damascus would continue to “leave this holy struggle until we have cleared all Syrian territories” for both terrorist groups and “all foreign presence”.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
As for refugees, Moualem said conditions are so good that they can return, and he accused "certain Western countries" of "spreading irrational escape" that causes refugees to stay away.
“We have contacted the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
They are policing what really is a purely humanitarian situation.”
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no support for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent deal between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the rebels’ last major defence position at Idlib has created an opportunity to press for political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement defended a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces against the province of three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front, who "will be wiped out".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes he can soon convene the first meetings of a new committee consisting of state and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for new elections.
Moualem set out conditions for the Syrian authorities to participate in the committee and said the work of the panel should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump Wants to Win Another Period
After that logic, Trump would have won re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers likely hope, federal law and scandal put an end to the presidency before that time.
In what would undoubtedly become “the most dramatic ending of a presidency ever!”
At the moment, there is no sign of sight.
Since 2014, the number of viewers for best broadcast time has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the best broadcast time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC "The Rachel Maddow Show" has peaked in cable numbers with a total of 3.5 million viewers on evenings with major news events.
“This is a fire that people are attracted to because we don’t understand anything,” said Neal Baer, program director for ABC’s drama Designated Survivor, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a renowned comedian and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club", has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
He said, “Because he makes me laugh.”
It's an entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else on TV, the actions taking place in Washington can determine the future of abortion rights, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the health of the global economy.
Departure is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you stretch out far to be an enlightened person when you sit for six hours to follow a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward’s use of “depth in background material” for the book “Fear”, Paul Manafort’s leather jacket with struts feathers worth <0x24>15,000 Trump, Post’s grandfather’s clothes of Washington, and Daniel’s hybrides.
I don’t want to see Super Mario in the same way anymore.
"Something he does that makes it look like a reality show is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, the daily head of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of Pawn Stars, about Trump's varied role crew and daily twists on the plot.
You can’t miss one episode or you’ll be hanging out.
When I met Fleiss this week, it was 27 <0xC2><0xB0>C and sun outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, Hawaii, but he crawled in and looked at MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not break himself apart, not when Brett Kavanaugh is due to meet the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the U.S. Supreme Court is at stake.
“I remember when we made all those crazy programs in the old days and people said this was the end of Western civilization,” Fleiss said.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Money from outside flows into the smoothest midterm elections to the House of Representatives
It’s no surprise that Pennsylvania’s 17th district experiences a stream of money after a relocation of a congressional district that ended up with two sitting representatives fighting for the same seat.
This newly-drawn suburban district of Pittsburgh sits with Democratic Representative Conor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in a supplementary election last spring.
Lamb is facing another sitting representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which largely overlaps the new 17th district.
The map was re-drawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were an unconstitutional manipulation of electoral circles in favor of Republicans.
The election in the new 17th district has led to an explosive campaign funding race between the largest party funding groups, the DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a short victory in a closely followed supplementary election for Pennsylvania’s 18th District to Congress in March last year.
That seat had been held by a Republican for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given Democrats a little leadership.
U.S. considers sanctions against El Salvador for support for China, then withdraws threat
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Trump had a heartfelt meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners kicked out the management team of the Trump Organization.
State Department officials have decided to recall U.S. diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “the recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan,” said Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the ministry, in a statement earlier this month.
But the criminal measures were only assessed against El Salvador, which received an estimated <0x24>140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed criminal measures, which included cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have become painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder figures.
While internal meetings were held, North American and Central American officials postponed a summit conference focusing on security and economic growth to follow up a similar gathering last year that was considered a step forward in an attempt to prevent migrants from coming to the United States.
But by mid-September, top administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, stopping all plans of criminal measures against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to speak to the conference, which is now scheduled in mid-October, to show the importance of the administration allowing the gathering, the diplomat said.
And the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new harsh messages or penalties from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal considerations on the condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Learning from History
The next nail in the box may be Special Adviser Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstruction to law enforcement, which is now very solid evidence in public documents.
Mueller is also allegedly expanding the investigation into whether Trump’s campaign cooperated with Russia in interfering in our elections.
If Congress were to change sides, Trump would be held accountable in that body, amid preparations to meet the voters again and perhaps eventually a jury of his peers.
There are many uncertain factors, and I don’t mean to claim that Trump’s fall is inevitable – nor for his counterparts in Europe.
We must make choices on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to make a coup against Hitler, if only the West had stood up against him and supported the Czechoslovaks at Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of bloodbaths that followed.
The course of history revolves around such tipping points, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or inhibited.
The Americans are facing several of these tipping points now.
What would we do if Trump fired Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in harsh weather ever since this newspaper reported that he proposed secret hearings last year to the president and speculated that he was unsuitable to be president.
Rosenstein says The Times' production is incorrect.
“How will we react if the recently initiated FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or if he is approved to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of abuse and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote during the midterm elections for a Congress that will put Trump in charge?
If we do not pass those tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don’t think we will fail, because of the experience I gained in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador’s home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me away to light the Sabbath lights on the table with the hook cross.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Rangers' Graham Dorran optimistic before meeting with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will take on Rapid Vienna on Thursday, in the certainty that winning over the Austrians after Spain's impressive draw against Villarreal earlier this month will give them a strong position to qualify for Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance for the season in the draw 2-2 against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use the result as a jumping board to get to bigger things.
“It was a good point for us since Villarreal is a good team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We went into the game and thought we could get something and got one point with us.
Maybe we could have nicked in at the end, but the draw was probably a good result.
They were probably better at first, and we came out in the second and were the best team.
On Thursday, it will be a big night in Europe.
We hope for three points, but it will be hard because they had a good result in the last game, but with the home crowd in the back, I’m sure we can stand up and get a positive result.
Last year was absolutely tough, between everything that happened to my injuries and the replacements in the club itself, but there is a good feeling now.
The teams are good and the guys are enjoying themselves; the training is good.
Hopefully we can stand up now, put the previous season behind us and get it done.”
Women lose night’s sleep due to fear of retirement savings
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, few spoke to their family about it.
About half of the people in the Nationwide study said they talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% said they talked to their children about it.
“People want to be taken care of by someone in their family, but they’re doing nothing to take that conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Life Insurance at Nationwide.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of yourself if you don’t say what you want in advance.
Discuss with the counselor and the family where and how the care should be given. Such choices can be of great importance in determining the costs.
Bring your financial advisor: The advisor can also help you figure out how to pay for the expenses.
The financing options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these expenses, or self-insurance with your own assets – if you have enough money.
Prepare your legal documents: Clean away legal issues immediately.
Get a health authority in place by appointing a person you trust to have oversight of your medical care, and making sure that health workers will comply with your wishes if you are prevented from communicating.
You should also consider giving some authority over your finances.
You choose a reliable person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure your bills are paid if you can’t do it yourself.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your old parents have a medical emergency and are on their way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down the details in an overview so you are prepared.
“It’s not just the economy at stake – who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
“What medicines do you need?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have that overview in place.”
Man shot several times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an airgun while on his way home after an outing.
The victim, a man in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as an "emotional act".
The victim did not see the assailant.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have sought witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a severe earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to officials, and deaths are expected to rise.
The communication is out of operation, and rescue workers have been unable to obtain information from the Dongala regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated the 40th anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a regency that extends along more than 300 km with coastline in the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The Regency, an administrative region below the provincial level, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the carrier beams of the central Sulawesi province economy, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Emergency Aid Administration.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit western Donggala in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Fire Ring in the Pacific Ocean and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A severe earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province north of Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, over half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of magnitude 6.8 hits the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hit the south coast. Nearly 700 were killed.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit one of the Mentawai Islands, outside Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters that raged dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: An earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh and caused destruction and panic while people were reminded of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but over 100 were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok and kill more than 500 people, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and resulted in thousands of tourists being temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of abuse.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, clashing with a report of domestic violence and opposition to arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he allegedly picked up the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to call the police to report the alleged abuse.
Palin is imprisoned in Mat-Su prison and is detained for an unsecured bond worth <0x24>500, KTUU reported.
He was brought before the court on Saturday, in which he declared himself “not guilty, absolutely” when asked how he was handling the guilt issue, the network reported.
Palin is faced with three Class A offences, which means he can be imprisoned for up to a year and fined <0x24>250,000.
He has also been charged with a Class B offence, which can be punished with one day in prison and a fine of <0x24>2,000.
This is not the first time a case has been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is filed in Alaska's Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, dismissing the report of domestic violence and holding a gun while he was drunk in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed that he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son’s violent behavior to PTSD after serving in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have been killed after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed many thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down, and deaths are expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck near central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
There are videos circulating on social media that show the outbreak.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami dunked inside the beach.
Federal prosecutors rarely seek death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York
New York federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspected terrorist attacker in New York that killed eight people – a rare punishment that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rented car from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a cycling road along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he struck down pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutor must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "intentionally" and caused serious bodily injuries intentionally, according to a notice of intent to apply for the death penalty in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these points qualify for a possible death penalty, according to the case document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury dropped the 22-point indictment, including eight counts of murder in connection with money-laundering, in the face of Saipov, normally used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and a count for violence and wreckage of vehicles.
The attack required "significant planning and purpose," said the actor, describing the way Saipov performed it as "horrible, cruel and corrupt".
"Sayfullo Habibulaevic Saipov caused personal injury, property and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco".
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the last time the Southern District of New York led a case that could result in the death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York, in 1953, was for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to carry out espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months after the attack, according to the court documents.
He told the investigators that he was happy with what he had done, police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his mobile phone, according to the prosecution.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag in the hospital room, police said.
He did not plead guilty to the 22-point indictment.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s publicly appointed defenders, said they were “openly disappointed” with the prosecution’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to apply for the death penalty, rather than accepting a confession and life in prison without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked the prosecution authorities not to apply for the death penalty.
Tory MP Says Nigel Farage Should Be Responsible for Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage pledged to “mobilize the army of the people” during a demonstration during the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians should be “feeling the pressure” from Euroskeptics when one of Theresa May’s own MPs suggested that he be given responsibility for the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told demonstrators in Birmingham that Britain "would have been extradited" now if Farage was Brexit secretary.
But May’s challenge to reconcile her deeply divided ranks has been underlined by the pro-Remain Tories who took part in a separate demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is fighting to keep his Brexit plan on track against attacks from Brexiters, Remainers and the EU.
Her supporters insisted that she will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the backlash – and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and “chaos”.
Bone told the Solihull protesters that he wanted to reject the Brexit plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been made a member and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had the responsibility, we would have been out now,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added: “I will stand for Brexit, but we must reject the Brexit plan.”
To explain his opposition to the European Union, he said: “We did not fight in two world wars to become submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone refuted claims that the popularity had changed since the 2016 vote: “The position that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely wrong.”
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the demonstration and told reporters: "I say quite simply: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The Brexit plan is unpopular with the general public. The opposition will not vote for it. It is unpopular with the party and with our activists, who are actually the ones who break the streets and get us elected in the first place.
Reject the Brexit plan and start listening.”
In a direct message to May, she added: “State ministers keep the job while they keep their promises.”
Farage said politicians would “feel pressure” if they thought they would betray the decision taken by the 2016 referendum.
“It’s now about the trust between us – the people – and the politicians,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to let them know they won’t get away with it.”
In a statement to an enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want you to let our politicians, who are on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the pressure.
“We are mobilizing the people’s army in this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud UK.”
Meanwhile, the Remainers marched through Birmingham before having a two-hour political gathering in the city center.
A small number of activists fancied with Tories Against Brexit banners after the group’s launch this weekend.
Labour member Lord Adonis ridiculed the conservatives for the security issues they had with a party app when the conference began.
“These are the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus, plus, for a friction-free border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren seriously considers running as presidential candidate
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "seriously consider running as presidential candidate" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Democrat from Massachusetts talked about the future at a council meeting west in Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, runs for re-election in November against Republican representative Geoff Diehl, who was the vice president of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been at the centre of speculation that she will face Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters, who have used the City Hall format since Trump became president.
A participant asked her if she planned to run as presidential candidate.
Warren responded that it is time for “women to come to Washington to fix our faulty government, and that includes a woman at the top.”
Arrest after Sims from LSU were killed in shooting
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, on Saturday reported that a suspect was arrested for the shooting that killed LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at a news conference at 11 a.m.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying a man who was observed on the video.
Sims, 20, were shot and killed near campus at Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a headshot and eventually died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was on the spot carrying guns, and admitted to shooting the Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without arrest and detained by East Baton Rouge Parish police officers.
Sims was a two-metre-high youth who grew up in Baton Rouge and played 32 games with 10 starts last season. His average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 returns per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton aims for World Championship title after counting men give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes’ stallors would play a major role in the race.
From the pole Bottas got a good start and nearly kicked Hamilton off the field while defending his position in the first two rounds and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove into the depot first and allowed Hamilton to continue driving in the rear of the main field, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes made a pit stop one lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton drove up after some pushing with the wheels that reluctantly let the Ferrari driver inside free after a double pass to defend himself in the third lap.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the field and entered number seven at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led much of the race while lying on the wheels to try to make a quick finish and overtake Kimi Raikkonen, who was number four.
He eventually entered the depot in the 44th round, but failed to increase the pace of the remaining eight rounds and Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri did a fabulous job all weekend and was a real gentleman who was told to let me go.
The team has done a fabulous job of getting a good two-lane,” Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein during a political event on Saturday for her holding that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at an event in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what took place in the Senate shows that people are “insane, cowardly, and speaking falsely.”
“The only thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you experience the mind, when you see people who are angry and evil and cowardly and speaking falsely,” he said.
“When you look at deliveries and leaks, and they say, ‘Oh, I haven’t done it.
I haven’t done it.”
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you leaked?
You remember her answer... you leaked the document – “Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I have not leaked.”
Hey, wait a minute.
We leaked... no, we didn’t leak,” he added, imitating the senator’s voice.
Feinstein received the letter with detailed information on Ford’s charges against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September – but Feinstein denied the leak came from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s claims, I didn’t leak her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it as confidential as she asked.”
But her denial was not graciously received by the president, who commented during the party event on Saturday night: “I’ll tell you one thing, it was a really bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
In his continued defense of the Supreme Court candidate, who has been accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats used the claims for their own purposes.
"They have decided to take back power by all necessary means.
You see the madness, the evil, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to override to gain power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made up for Friday's Elite League loss against the Belfast Giants by winning the return game 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants were shot by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equated for the home team before Dwyer restored leadership for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard scored for Dundee before two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third Elite League loss of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had come back after they beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the third meeting of the season between the teams, and the Giants had won the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford quit the game when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what became a hectic opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt added to Cownie's equation at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants had the lead at break when he took his second goal for the evening at the end of the first round.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard scored again with a championship goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time during the game late in the second round, and he secured the win with the team's five halfway out in the final round.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are playing home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Airplane leader dies to ensure hundreds of air passengers escape earthquake
A flight manager in Indonesia is praised as well after his death and ensured that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers could take off safely.
More than 800 people have died, and many are missing after a severe earthquake hit Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks continue to terrorize the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Even after his colleagues had fled for life, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the heavily swamping control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He stayed to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could safely ease.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it would collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision could have saved many hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to move him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our hearts broke when we heard it,” he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could rise to several thousand, and the country’s disaster preparedness agency reports that there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
“The numbers are expected to increase further since many bodies are still trapped under the ruins and many have not been able to reach,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Up to six-meter-high waves have raged Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “You see ambulances picking up the dead all the time.
There is a lack of clean water.
Minimarkets are being robbed everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “Indonesian Red Cross is working feverishly to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
It’s already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask you all to work day and night to carry out all the tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” he told CNN.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake earlier this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini plane crashed in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports missing man after plane crashed in lagoon
The airline, which owned the plane that crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says that one man is missing. They previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the declining plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that every Saturday afternoon there was one male passenger they had no overview.
The airline said they worked with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to the request for more details about the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been transported to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, and the condition of all was stable.
What led to the crash and the exact sequence of events is still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon just outside the runway.
Some witnesses believed the plane was bombed on the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane flew very low.
“It’s a very good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to flow through the waist-deep water to the emergency exit on the sinking plane.
He said the pilots were panicking and screaming, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to repair a brewery also helped in the rescue work by using an inflatable boat to transport people on land before the plane sank about 30 meters below the water surface.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network suggests that 111 people have died in a crash with PNG-registered aircraft over the past twenty years, but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analyst presents the timeline for the night a woman was burned alive
Prosecutors closed the procedure on Saturday in a new trial for a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used mobile prints to puzzle the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Rowlett said he retrieved location data from several mobiles that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which was contrary to what he had claimed earlier, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in the same place as Chambers’ cell phone at the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went to the witness box on Saturday and claimed that he was not in the city that day.
When the actor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed he was in the Sanford trailer that night, Sanford said he "lived because my trailer was in Nashville".
Another disagreement was that Tellis claimed he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile prints suggest that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted calls, contact details, and messages to and from Chambers from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to begin its procedure on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to be left to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is socially motivated hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling the music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that hip hop has moved from its origins with political messages to addressing social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and make community-oriented hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have experienced a new bloom in the UK through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
New York children's passports prosecute couple for "racist" message
A New York children’s passport sues a couple for discriminatory termination after receiving a misdirected message from her mother, who complained that she was “just a black person.”
The couple rejected their racist views, comparing the lawsuit to “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a two-child mother, expressed disappointment when she found out that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she met up for the first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEII ENDA A SWART PERIOD", Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
But instead of sending it to the man, she sent it to Maurice, twice.
After discovering the loss, it was an "inconvenient" Plasco-Flaxman who resigned Maurice, claiming that their dismissal babysitter, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she had expected one from the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Maurice got paid for his one working day and was then sent home with an Uber.
Maurice now sues the couple for compensation for the cancellation and demands compensation in the amount of <0x24>350 a day for the six-month, loss-based arrangement she was promised, however without a contract.
“I wanted to show them that – hey, you just don’t,” she told the New York Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple have turned back on the allegations that they are racist and say the resignation of Maurice was the only right thing to do, since they didn’t feel they could trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent her something she wasn’t going to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist,” Joel Plasco told the New York Post.
“But would you have left your children to someone you had been rude to, even if it was a misunderstanding?
Your newborn child?
Let's go."
The comparison of the lawsuit with "extortion" said Plasco was due to his wife having only two months to term and was in a "very difficult situation".
Is there such a person you want to punish?
It’s not very nice,” the stockbroker added.
As the legal case goes on, the People’s Court has been quick to condemn the couple on social media and criticize them for their behavior and attitudes.
Paddington Publishers Fear Readers Would Not Accept a Speaking Bear, Reveals New Letter
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, said of the letter: “It is difficult to sit in the place of others when they read it for the first time before it was published.
It’s very funny to know what we know now about Paddington’s great success.”
She says her father, who had worked as a cameraman on the BBC before he was inspired to write the children’s book by a little bear, would have been very pleased that his work had been rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book’s release was “bitter sweet” after he passed away last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important family member" and adds that her father was secretly very proud of the success he achieved.
“He was a fairly quiet man, and he wasn’t a proud person,” she said.
“But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like when you have a child that makes a gift: you’re proud of it even though it’s not really your fault.
I think he looked at Paddington's success a bit like that.
Even though it was his product and his imagination, he always used to honor Paddington himself.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone
On landing, her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say it looked so bad that he didn't think she was going to survive," Ednan-Laperouse said.
“So I got Nad’s phone that said she was going to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you so much, my friend.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll come to you.
The medicine the doctors had given her to make her heart beat, slowly lost its effect and left the system.
She died a while earlier and the organs in her body collapsed.
I just had to sit there and wait for it to happen.
I couldn’t cry and scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to get together.”
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned the loss of his daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers – who did not know about the trials she underwent.
“No one knew,” she said.
“I looked down all the time and the tears ran in a steady stream.
It's hard to explain, but it was there on the plane that I felt this overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Postcards with sad women to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones in suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up postcards on a bridge in Wales with encouraging messages and phone numbers folks can call for help.
Sharon's son Tyler was 13 when he was depressed and killed when he was 18.
“I don’t want any parents to experience what I have to experience again every day,” she says.
Sharon, 45, who lives in Lydney, says her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him with a smile.
They said that his smile could illuminate any room.”
He quit his job before he died because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother was one of those who found him after he killed himself.
Sharon says: “I worry all the time that there will be an infectious effect.”
Sharon made the cards “to tell people that there are people out there that they can go to and talk to, even if it’s just a friend.
Don’t sit down for yourself – you need to talk to someone.”
Kelly, who has been Sharon's friend for many years, lost Mark, his partner through 15, not long after his mother died.
“He didn’t tell me he felt depressed or depressed or anything,” she says.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed the changing mood.
On the first day of Christmas, he was completely in the basement – when the kids opened the Christmas gifts, they didn’t get eye contact or anything.”
She says his death was a great trauma for them, but they have to fight through it: “It breaks up a big hole in the family.
It'll tear us apart.
But we all have to endure and fight.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs in a thin thread while the FBI starts investigation
“I thought that if we could get something of what he asked for — a time and scope-limited investigation — maybe we could come to a certain consensus,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would “fall apart” along fixed party boundaries.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
The opposition was due to timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, November 6 – if the Republicans are presumably doing it badly, it will be considerably harder for them to get the man they want elected to the country’s highest court.
George W. Bush has called around to senators and run lobbying to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and met his wife Ashley there when she was the personal secretary for Bush.
What happens after the FBI has delivered its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, so Vice President Mike Pence can use his double vote and bring him to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean Abductees ‘fall’ under Kim
The number of North Korean retreats to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, which refers to data from the South Korean Ministry of Collecting, said there had been 1,127 dropouts last year – compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said stricter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as higher prices among human smugglers, were key factors.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly.
The majority of North Koreans will eventually be offered citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the strictly guarded demilitarized zone between the two Korean states.
China considers the deceased to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and returns them by force.
The North-South relationship – which is technically still at war – has improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met for talks about the closed negotiations on denuclearization.
This happened after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they largely agreed to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the U.S. sanctions for lack of progress since then.
“Without trust in the United States there will be no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no possibility that we will unilaterally rest down first,” Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and says he is unfit to sit in Supreme Court
Minority leader of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he had a temper that made him unsuitable to sit in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the statements in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help thinking that if a woman had behaved like this, she would have been called hysterical,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the sentiment that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening statement, sometimes he almost yelled and was crying when he talked about his family and the years of high school.
He also strongly condemned the committee’s democrats and called the allegations against him a “gross and coordinated character murder” organized by liberals who were angry at Hillary Clinton’s loss of the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh’s testimony shows that he cannot sit in the Supreme Court since it shows that he is prejudiced against Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he attacked the Clinton couple and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to sue Kavanaugh if he was approved and if the Democrats won the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I want to say this – if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress and the FBI, he’s not just unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he’s sitting in right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals (announced court).
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) or Roe v. Wade (abortion rights), since he is considered a conservative judge.
In the interrogation, Kavanaugh evaded questions about whether he would re-examine certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the time to send a hysterical, partial person to the Supreme Court and expect us to applaud it,” Pelosi said.
And women have to deal with it.
It’s a just anger, months and years where the mind takes over, and she can’t get it out without crying.
“We cry when we are angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s that weird, do you?”
She continues: “I got good help from a woman who was my boss somewhere, who said she was also crying when she got angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, “You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just continued.
And I thought I was great.”
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger in part because they become fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories from one of my first jobs was in a man-dominated office. I began to cry with inexplicable rage and was caught in the necklace of an older woman – a cool boss I had always been a little afraid of – who took me to a staircase.
“Never let them see you crying,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They’ll think you’re sad and be happy because they managed to catch you.”
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado at the time, had worked with Gary Hart when he ran for president.
In 1987, when Hart was revealed to be cheating on his spouse on board a boat called Monkey Business and resigned from the election, Schroeder was very frustrated and thought there was nothing in the way to explore the possibilities of running for president himself.
“It wasn’t a thoughtful decision,” she said with a laugh 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last one they needed was another.
Some called it “The Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
Since it was nearing the end of the campaign, she lay down with the funding and swore she wouldn’t leave if she didn’t get <0x24>2 million.
It was a lost fight.
She discovered that some of the supporters who gave <0x24>1,000 to men gave her only <0x24>250.
“Do you think I’ll get a discount?” she asked.
When she gave the speech to announce that she did not want to launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions – gratitude to the people who had supported her, frustration about the system that made it so difficult to raise money and reach voters instead of delegates, as well as anger over sexism – that she fell into tears.
“You would think I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls how the press spoke to her.
“You should have thought that Kleenex was my main sponsor.
I remember thinking my faith what they would write on my graveyard?
“She was crying?”
How the U.S.-China Trade War Can Win Beijing
The opening oils in the U.S.-China trade war were overwhelming, and even though the fight is far from over, a rift between the countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The major escalation occurred this week with new tariffs on goods worth <0x24>200 billion, which means tariffs on half of all goods imported to the United States from China.
Of course, Beijing has paid back each time, most recently with a five to ten percent strike on US goods worth <0x24>60 billion.
China has pledged to match the U.S. attack for attack, and the world’s second-largest economy will probably not raise the white flag at first.
Getting Washington downstairs means surrendering to demands, but public submission to the United States will be too humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Experts say, however, that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the pressure around the trade war with the United States could provide a positive outlook for China in the long run by reducing the mutual dependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create conditions that start economic ringing in one of the countries is actually much more dangerous than viewers have previously realized,” said Abigail Grace, a fellow researcher at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria ‘ready’ for return of refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to re-enter the country, which has been ravaged after more than 7 years of war.
Speaking at the UN National Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safe thanks to progress in combating terrorism,” he said.
The state continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All conditions are now being facilitated for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they may have left due to terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, six million people still live in the country, in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that there would be no acceptance of conditional assistance or assistance from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe secures Ryder Cup wins in Paris
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup after defeating Team USA with a final score of 16.5 vs. 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the throne when the team of Danish team captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn got the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who played during much of the tournament, melted his tee-shoots in the water at the par-3 16th hole, and had to see himself beaten by Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari was brilliant in all his rounds and became 1 of 4 golfers who have ever gone 5-0-0 since the tournament got its current design in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5 and 4 of the lowest-ranked player on the European team, Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup final.
With a total of eight Ryder Cup tournaments behind, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the most-winning European of all time with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t stop.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful that Thomas picked me out and had faith in me.
I am very, very happy to get the cup back.
It’s about the team and I’m glad I could be of help,” an emotional Garcia said after the European victory.
He leaves the staff stick to his countryman John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in a singles game on Sunday.
“I’m incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods – I followed that man closely in growing up,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 career score in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the greatest golfers ever, who has won 14 major titles, just beat by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA spent the entire weekend finding the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played golf with high precision throughout the tournament.
US team captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing achievement for his troops, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
There were moments this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We threw ourselves.
Hat off to Thomas.
He's a great team captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We want to regroup, I want to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we want to look forward.
I love these 12 guys and I am proud to be their team captain.
You just have to take off your hat.
We were beaten.”
