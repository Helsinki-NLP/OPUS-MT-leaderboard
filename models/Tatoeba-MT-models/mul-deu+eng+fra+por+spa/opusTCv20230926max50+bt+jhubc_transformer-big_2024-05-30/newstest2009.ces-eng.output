The Prague Stock Exchange fell to a minus at the end of trading
After the early morning crash, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected the losses.
Transactions with <0xC4><0x8C>EZ shares accounted for almost half of the normal daily trade.
The Prague Stock Exchange has since the beginning of Tuesday’s trading on its Monday decline, when it fell almost six percent.
This time there is a decline in Wall Street stocks.
This is also how the market reacts to the result of the vote of the U.S. House of Representatives, which has refused to support a plan to stabilize the financial sector there.
The fall of shares in Asia
The stock market in Asia fell dramatically on Tuesday, although the indexes eventually wiped out some of the losses over the course of the day.
The Hang Seng Stock Exchange Index in Hong Kong declined nearly four percent during trading, but later deleted part of the losses and decreased to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which monitors the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, declined by 3.8 percent, while the markets in Shanghai were closed.
Shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than 5%, but eventually dropped the loss to 4.3%.
The stock market in Taiwan fell by 3.6 percent, according to the dark index.
"The timing of a bailout in the U.S. is uncertain and will affect financial markets around the world," said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.
Hong Kong, although part of China, decides monetary policy independently, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States.
U.S. lawmakers, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, should quickly return to negotiations and approve a proposal to support the financial system.
In other words, the impacts will be felt by other countries as well.
The bloody bath of American stocks
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected a plan to support the financial system, on which up to <0x24>700 billion (almost CZK 12 trillion) should be spent.
Legislators ignored President George Bush’s call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would address the underlying causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks on Monday experienced a bloody bath and major stock indices recorded the biggest drop in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell almost seven percent, and a similar decline last recorded in 1987.
The index fell before the vote, but as soon as it turned out that the bill had not passed in the House, the index was in a free fall.
Congress Resigns: U.S. Government May Pump <0x24>700 Billion to Banks
Higher U.S. Congress and President George W. Bush’s government have agreed on a broader financial aid agreement for the U.S. financial system.
Voting on it will be at the beginning of next week.
U.S. lawmakers have made a breakthrough in talks on the approval of the bailout plan in the form of financial aid for the U.S. financial system in the amount of <0x24>700 billion (approximately <0x24>12 trillion).
However, it has not yet been won.
Congressmen must complete some details of the agreement before they can publish the final form of the law and vote on it.
The plan to support the financial system will be discussed on the floor of the House of Representatives on Monday.
Barney Frank, chairman of the House’s Banking and Financial Services Committee, told Reuters on Sunday.
In the Senate, sources say the plan could be voted on by early Wednesday.
According to economists, the announcement that a rescue plan will be approved should be the first important psychological factor for the recovery of financial markets.
Then, however, there will be a "consolidation" due to the complexity of the mechanisms that help markets achieve in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have made a lot of progress.
We have resolved our divergent views on what the package should look like to stabilize the market," Bloomberg Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
He said the final vote could be held on Sunday.
Legislative representatives met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Sunday night to give a definitive shape to the government fund.
It should buy non-sales mortgage assets from financial firms that bring financial firms down to heavy losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
“We are on the verge of a definitive deal plan that will work and must also be effective in the market.
We still have to go on with the recovery plan, but I think we're there," Paulson said.
Signal for Asian Trade
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on the stock markets, which are declining sharply.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are trying to reach a definitive deal in Congress on Sunday.
They want to calm investors before trading on Asian financial markets, which are in the first timeframe where Congress’ decision could influence Monday’s trading.
However, it is not yet clear when the two chambers of the US Congress will vote on the law, or whether the negotiations can be linked to a problem at the last minute.
Legislators expect it to be approved in the next few days.
However, the law still makes a number of changes.
The total amount allocated for assistance to the system shall be divided into two parts.
The initial <0x24>350 billion is to be available as soon as possible, as President George Bush has requested.
But Congress can block the release of the remaining sum if it feels that the program is not fulfilling its function, following an additional <0x24>100 billion and later a final <0x24>350 billion.
Bush assesses progress in negotiations
Although the President may veto this decision, Congress may override his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program, which was to obtain funds to buy bad mortgage securities, whose value has declined because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to repay their mortgage, remained preserved.
"We've worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," Republican Senator Judd Gregg said.
US President Bush is also pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said Bush was pleased with Saturday's progress and appreciated "the mutual effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Restriction of gold slopes
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, the chief negotiator, said that the legislators agreed to be responsible for the monetary program, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closing of reliefs, the timing of financing the plan.
The new law is also intended to limit the so-called gold drops for the directors of the company participating in the program and set up a committee to supervise the fund.
He should be headed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We have been working very hard on this and have made great progress towards an agreement that will work and be beneficial to the market and to all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also counts on help for homeowners who have problems with repayment.
The government should negotiate new payments from the mortgages it buys in order to reduce monthly expenses for debtors and allow them to keep their homes.
Brand: Psychological Assistance
The proposed plan is a good idea, according to Chief Economist of Finance Patria David Mark, but it will be very difficult to implement.
"And that's because we don't know what mechanism and at what price the problem assets will be purchased.
This will be decisive for how the financial sector and the government will divide the losses,” Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan is approved now or at the beginning of next week, Mark says it's not that important.
"It is much more important that Congressmen agree this week that they support this plan and that it will be dedicated to it as soon as possible.
“The psychological significance of the agreement to be approved is the most important at this point,” Marek said.
Knife blade: MP3 players against mobiles.
We will advise you on how to choose
While almost every mobile can play MP3 files, no MP3 player is able to call.
This makes it clear that it is better to only buy a phone.
However, there are plenty of reasons for a person to get a separate player.
The choice depends entirely on the manner of use and claims of the future owner.
You may find it hard to get a top-notch expensive phonograph at home to listen to the latest album by Maxim Turbulenc.
However, such music products on LP discs are not based, and there is no objective reason for this from a qualitative point of view.
However, if your shelves are squeezed with art rock, jazz or blues, you probably dream of such a gramophone at least.
The same is true of music on the go, that is, music compressed, simply - music in MP3.
There are also price and quality categories.
It may be unacceptable for someone to spend eight thousand kroner for a player, just as a Pink Floyd fan can hardly beat the headphones for twenty kroner from the market.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
It also decides battery life
Some top-notch music players can do much more than just play music, but what most mobile phones don’t even happen.
No current device is as versatile as a phone.
In addition to primary functions, telephone and essaying, he can play music and video, both record, has a better camera, worse camera, and maybe can navigate.
And when we consider smartphones and communicators, you will have a small computer in your pocket.
It’s a small miracle, because no refrigerator can barbecue and no TV does not photograph anything.
The versatility of mobile phones also brings disadvantages.
The more features you use on your mobile, the sooner the display indicator sends you to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest bursts of energy.
A few mobile phones can play music for more than ten to twelve hours, usually much less.
In this direction, the music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
For cheap mobile phones, therefore, count on the fact that they won’t play you for more than a few hours.
If you’re still calling here and there, get another charger to work for sure – this applies even to more expensive devices.
With MP3 players, you won’t have this problem, even the worst ones will last at least 9 hours of continuous operation on a single charge.
Another problem arises when recording music on a mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices have a universal USB connector, and not every one of them can be connected directly to the computer without any special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on a memory card, but only a few card readers can deal with miniature memory cards that are used in mobile devices without reduction.
You don’t need any special software for players except for exceptions (iPods).
Simply fill the device with music via USB from the computer.
Most mobile phones and players will already create their own music library, sorted by the name of the performer, the name of the album, the genre or, for example, the user’s ratings.
Some devices display only the tree structure of directories similar to Windows Explorer, and some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobiles are more skilled
When choosing a particular device, take special care of the battery life, memory capacity, quality and type of sound output, and of course also the comfort of control.
If your music is primarily a backdrop and you listen to it every day, for example, for a short time in the tram, you just need a mobile phone that plays MP3.
This can be done by virtually any mobile phone.
You don’t even have to watch too much what music formats a mobile phone or player can do.
MP3 can handle all and most of the music you get will be in this format.
It is one of the most widely used, and besides it, the vast majority of instruments can also play music in the WMA format.
There is less AAC (a format used by Apple and its iPods).
Better mobile phones also allow, for example, to buy music online.
Simply visit the relevant website of the operator (or other provider) via the mobile internet and buy a song or album.
This service could already in itself be a common argument for acquiring a music mobile.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is miserable and is mostly limited to fast-paced radio hits.
The prices are also not the lowest.
However, it is generally assumed that this way of selling music (whether via GSM, internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people still carry their cars with them.
Whenever you get the taste of listening to something, your mobile phone is loaded in your pocket, while the MP3 player is lying forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you always carry a headphone or at least a wired hands-free.
If not, you can use an integrated speaker that has almost every mobile, but only a minimum of MP3 players.
Probably the biggest advantage of music mobiles will be for many.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than <0x24>3,000.
For three and four thousand crowns you will already get a very decent walkman.
Most of the time, however, you will be limited by the absence of output to the regular headphones.
The best and technically the most advanced phones even with a 3.5 mm wall for regular headphones cost up to fifteen thousand.
The advantage of the player is, among other things, easy operation.
The simplest - not necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - players can really control everyone.
Minimum functions, the similarity of control with a previously conventional cassette or, for example, a gramophone is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of an error on the mobile internet and then a huge data transfer account.
On which device to touch
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of the relevant card you will enter up to two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
For basic models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are supported.
Only the most expensive ones can handle even with 8 GB of memory.
If you already have a mobile phone and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, save for Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you do not need to spend more than 1,100 kroner.
If you’re one of the most demanding listeners, you’d better use specialized mobile phones – walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3 and the comfort of operation is so close to a separate MP3 player.
Recently, the Sony Ericsson industry, whose walkman mobiles have the same user interface as separately sold MP3 players.
With the same service and in the same price category up to 4,000 SEK, but with greater memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours), MP3 players will take you away from the above brands.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Possibly
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively advanced and our operators offer virtually all services as their partners in Western Europe.
Still, we're missing something here - a virtual operator that would force the classics to discount.
Maybe he won't be missing for a long time.
About the fact that Czech operators are one of the most expensive in Europe, we have written on Mobil.cz many times.
This was also confirmed by the CTU, who warned that the price of SMS is higher in our country than in the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming fees, there may be a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that would really want to get into the fight.
Maybe it sounds paradoxical, but we have three mobile networks and penetration is over 100%.
Mobile operators, on the other hand, like to argue that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
They are often quoted by the Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (CTE), Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99>ák, who in the past said several times that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It’s probably true that a classic operator with his own network probably doesn’t have too many chances anymore (by the way, it’s probably just hard to look for frequencies).
But there is another option - a virtual operator.
It was the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that brought significant price cuts, to which also the classic operators had to react.
In the UK, before the entry of plugs like Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile, voices like ours were heard.
However, it turned out that the place for such operators is and can be really successful.
We don’t have to go too far for examples.
In February of this year, we informed you about the launch of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just six months, this operator has managed to acquire more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator there.
At the same time, behind Mobilking is the financial group Penta, which owns U:fona in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to be able to operate effectively, they have far fewer customers than a classic operator.
They do not carry relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
In the world, virtual operators usually profile as low-cost - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often balanced by a narrower range of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be quite a good draw and betting on an unfired target group.
This operator is specifically aimed at men.
“Administrative guys choose Mobilking – an operator they like and can trust,” says David Seibertz, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, who operates this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept could be caught in Poland as well.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> doubts this: “The Czech market is relatively small for the segmental approach on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated in terms of the offer of services."
In the Czech Republic without a chance, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual mobile operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but the negotiations in the Czech Republic do not look too hopeful.
Rather, Mobilking will be launched in other countries of our region," Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ková, a press spokeswoman for Penta Financial Group, said in a telephone interview for Mobil.cz.
She indirectly confirmed that the existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not in favour of this idea.
Rather, they are trying to do everything possible to ensure that no potential competitor arises.
The interest in launching a virtual mobile operator has long been uncovered by the GTS Novar Group, which would like to take the next step to become a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the field of corporate customers.
“We have a great interest in being able to offer our customers not only solid, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner, the better.
This option has been discussed with all Czech mobile operators over and over again.
With some of them, we have already managed to make progress in the negotiations,” said Pavel Kaidl, a spokesman for the group.
So maybe he's flipping for better times.
It appears from informal information that we should expect the first virtual operator perhaps by the end of the year.
But for now, its formation is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"We do not think that there is room in the Czech market for the creation of a full-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market is very specific compared to other markets.
So far, we have not been contacted by any entity with a comprehensive and serious project in this area," Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>en<0xC4><0x9B> from the Telefónica O2 press department said in a statement for Mobil.cz.
The specificity of the Czech market is also appealed to by other operators.
Press spokeswoman for T-Mobile Martina Kemrová adds in rarely compliant with the statement of O2: "In the meantime, we have not recorded any viable and mutually beneficial business project on which to build further."
He added: “In the T-Mobile network, by the end of the year, virtual operators will hardly appear.
At this point, we would have to have a concrete agreement on the table so that it would be possible to consider this short horizon."
Vodafone refuses to pay attention to the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> says: “We are open to dealing with potential virtual operators, especially in the area of cost sharing and infrastructure.
This is what we consider to be the most beneficial from the point of view of our customers.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for fast mobile internet.”
Responsible authorities - with operators one hand
The procedure of mobile operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean increased competition, would lead to a drop in prices and thus to a decrease in their profits.
So why make it easier for such a competitor?
The fact that when it comes to something, the operators are able to pull a rope, they are also witnesses to the formation of the U:fon.
Probably the biggest pressure towards <0xC4><0x8C>TU was at the time of the creation of U:fona by T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by publicly available information from the <0xC4><0x8C>TU website.
Now, however, U:fon fits as an argument for why a virtual operator is not allowed.
Martina Kemrová added: “The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently been reinforced by the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
Given the character of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of another player would place high demands on him and above all on his services."
However, due to this approach of mobile operators, there is a total disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities.
It is not just about the attitude of the Czech Republic, which unfortunately - unlike the UK and other developed countries - does not have the power to interfere in economic competition.
They belong exclusively to the Competition Protection Office (ECSC).
But he took his typical stance on the whole issue.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible after the conclusion of a contract between a mobile operator and a virtual operator to lease the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has yet been concluded, as the offer of potential stakeholders was probably not interesting enough for classic operators," said Kristian Chalupa of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS External Relations Department in response to our question.
It is not surprising to the representatives of the operators.
From an authority to represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, to ensure that no one abuses their position on the market, it is more than a matter of consideration.
Particularly when Kristian Chalupa adds: "In the overseas, where virtual operators normally operate, we can see that their entry into the market has contributed to lowering prices for mobile phone services."
However, it seems that the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the price decline are not in the interest of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
In fact, shockingly over the whole case is the imposing conviction of three mobile operators, which results from their reactions.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence is offered entirely on its own.
As well as the exact same price of gasoline at gas stations is certainly just part of a coincidence and a tough competition fight.
"The Authority has not sought evidence of anti-competitive conduct in this case and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position, and therefore has no correspondingly increased responsibility for their actions in the market.
The necessary tools to open the mobile market for virtual operators are also likely to meet the telecommunications regulator," Chalupa said in a statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the CTU, according to which telecommunications are, from the point of view of competition, the single market.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech operators have a dominant position.
Some legal experts, however, offer a different view - for the creation of a virtual operator, the consent of the network operator is always required.
And the mobile operator - it has quite a logic - on its network monopoly.
So in a certain segment it must necessarily be dominant.
However, even if we do not accept this argument, it should be a minimum warning for the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS that three mobile operators are acting noticeably similarly.
At the same time, complaints from a number of interested parties (including GTS Nowera) show that they encounter very similar obstacles in dealing with all operators.
In telecommunications, <0xC3><0x9A>OHS is a fairly common trick, which takes away from the whole issue.
We’ve met him on a number of similar occasions.
Unfortunately, until the recent adoption of the Telecommunications Act, the extension of <0xC4><0x8C>TU’s powers to the field of competition in telecommunications did not succeed, although a number of experts have promised an improvement in the situation.
<0xC3><0x9A>OHS representatives must know this more than well, but apparently their interests are elsewhere.
That's what happens when no one's looking
At the same time, the operation of some pseudovirtual operators remains unnoticed, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks.
These are companies that issue their own pricelists for mobile phone services, but are only partially public.
This is usually a multi-level marketing business.
Its own mobile phone services are offered by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The prices of these companies will usually only reach the selected ones.
The charm lies in the fact that the company acts towards the operator as a classic corporate customer who orders large amounts of SIM cards.
As an important customer, you will then receive special price (and additional) offers.
The problem is that the business conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar resale.
"If there were cases you're talking about, it could be a violation of the terms of the contract that we would deal with and could result in termination of cooperation with the company," said Martina Kamrová.
However, it is quite unlikely that such activity would not affect the responsible people from mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned above, there may be thousands of customers.
None of the operators will prevent such a move.
In fact, these companies have unnoticed profits from their activities and, unlike real virtual operators, they do not in any way endanger their own official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> points out the possible problems: "The law allows similar speculation, however, the services of these companies use only a negligible percentage of customers.
In addition, they must accept that the SIM card in their phone is not held in their name, so they cannot be fully available to them as regular customers of mobile operators."
But that should be at least strange to read.
In addition, another question opens up for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to a similar process, why are they blocking the emergence of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS has a relatively strong authority to disclose similar activities, and if it does not want to, it does not have to be satisfied with the operators’ explanation that they have no idea of such a thing and their trading conditions prohibit it.
When We Will Not Be the Most Expensive
As has already been said several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has led to a marked decline in service prices.
At the same time, in virtually all countries where virtual operators were created, the classic operators were more or less trying to defend their creation.
The arguments used by them were practically identical - too small, perhaps too saturated market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In developed countries, however, regulatory authorities have intervened in these moments, defending not the interests of mobile operators, but their customers.
Whether it was formal measures or informal pressure, the first virtual operator was created, and more were added to it.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory authorities overheat the whole case like hot potatoes.
From our experience we cannot get rid of the impression that the uncertainty in their competences is more than suitable for them in these cases.
But let's not put the flour in the grain.
If the background information is correct and the virtual operator appears with us very soon, the Czech mobile market may be shifting again.
If one of the operators has admitted the emergence of a virtual mobile operator, it will be difficult for the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS to remain ineffective in refusing (discrimination) other stakeholders.
Perhaps we will stop calling the ride than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to four versions of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of Czech State Day, presented a new recording of the national anthem Kde miojj.
The hymn was re-recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99>í B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávk.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo singing, in choir performance and instrumental lyrics.
The song was sung by Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Knezínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the hymn are Otakar Jeremías and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
You can listen to all four versions on the iHNed.cz server.
B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek considers the Czech national song to be one of the most beautiful hymns.
He had previously told Czech radio that he had deliberately chosen to sing solo variants of singers with young representative voices, which are pronounced and popular.
"From the beginning, I was with both of them, and then I tried to make sure that the congregation had a clear sentence, so that the text was well understood, so that they could confess," he said.
The Czech National Anthem will be celebrating its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where My Home was first performed in 1834 on the boards of the Stavovsky Theatre in the original Czech play Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka Josef Kajetán Tyl accompanied by music by Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ka <0xC5><0xA0>krupa.
It gained popularity and people spontaneously took it as their own.
The first slogan of the song became a natural part of the national anthem after the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven national symbols remained after the establishment of the independent Czech Republic.
What does the "new" hymn sound like?
Prague MHD on Wednesday for the first time on a chip
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be recorded in the history of the Prague Transportation Company as the date when the first passengers will arrive in the metro, trams and buses, who will have an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
At this point, it can be bought by about one hundred thousand people who own an Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy a 30-day and 90-day and yearly coupon (which will be valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time allow them to upload on their chip card in the information centers and workstations of the Transport Company in the metro stations of Museum, M<0xC5><0x99>estek, Nádra<0xC5><0xBE>í Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, An<0xC4><0x8D>e, Kohlysza, Katyrovy
Coupons can also be purchased online from yesterday on the website of Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by more than four hundred customers in the afternoon.
Those who are starting to use the online store can definitely forget the drop-out windows in the metro stations, where they have to stop regularly on long fronts on paper tickets.
The coupon is purchased online and uploaded to the Opencard card in one of the thirteen branches of the City Library.
"In these places, passengers have access to a cross-section with a trained service, which will help visitors with online shopping and also upload a purchased coupon to their card," said project spokesman Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>.
In addition to libraries, it will be possible to upload electronic coupons to Opencard also in self-service machines, which are installed in several metro lobbys.
What do these machines look like?
They are red, reminiscent of ticket markers and passengers may have already noticed them at the metro stations of Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are five in the city now, but by the end of the year there should be eighty," he added.
Coupon will check the driver's seat
The operation of the automatons that will start working tomorrow is simple.
Simply slide the Opencard chip card into them and the previously paid coupon will be uploaded to it.
Electronic coupons will be valid not only in the capital, but also in its surroundings.
That is, in suburban trains and bus lines with numbers 300 to 499, which drive to the capital, mainly the inhabitants of the central Chinese municipalities.
"In the trains included in the integrated transport in Prague, the guides are equipped with card readers, using which they determine the time and band validity of the coupons," said Filip Drápal of the Ropid organization, which compiles the schedules of the Prague public transport service.
Suburban buses have card readers built into the driver’s cash register.
Therefore, you need to show the driver not only a chip card at the start, but you also need to attach the Opencard to the designated place on the side of the cash register.
This will ensure that the driver checks the validity of the vouchers.
"If passengers need to verify the validity of the recorded coupons, nothing is easier than asking the driver for this information," Dr<0xC4><0x81>pal added.
Passengers who do not take suburban buses and will not remember when the coupon expires can go back to the self-service vending machines where the coupons are recorded on the card.

The Sudanese wanted a U.S. referendum
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans demanded the inclusion of <0xC5><0xA0>umava in the United States.
It follows from a letter that is stored in the collections of the South Chemistry Science Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the patronage of the United States of America.
With such a wish, some groups of Sudeten Germans reportedly turned to the President of the United States in 1945.
This is reflected, among other things, in a letter that was kept in a private archive and is now stored in the collections of the Southwestern Science Library.
The Germans of Czechoslovak Krumlov are demanding in a letter from the US president not to allow the return of the "South county" - banned by Hitler on the basis of the Munich agreement - to Czechoslovakia.
“We have understood the situation correctly and we want to be really sure the words that American troops are coming to Germany not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators,” the letter reads, “People whose fate lies in the heart of <0xC5><0xA0>umava.”
Because the accession to Czechoslovakia is supposed to give the Sudanese Germans - with the knowledge of the Czech national nature - hope only for brutality, carelessness, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter of the U.S. president request that he take over <0xC5><0xA0>umava.
“We can’t believe that, regardless of the opinion of a quarter of a million people, you would give this territory to a foreign country that oppresses and pushes minorities and nothing at all contributed to the Allies’ victory,” the letter reads.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is allegedly fear of the revenge of the "Czech oppressors".
If the U.S. president allegedly doubted the thinking of the Germans, it would be enough to hold a referendum in the U.S.-sponsored municipality, whether its residents want to become part of the U.S. or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound somewhat naive in the knowledge of post-war history today, according to some memoirs it suits the expectations of the Sudden Germans at the time.
Although the Czech Germans had to at least assume that it would be their deportation from the republic, few of them allowed such an option at all.
Some expected the United States and the United Kingdom to negotiate with the Sudetenland some kind of autonomy.
Others believed that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice.
He was a Buddhist German deployed to the Baltic navy during the wars.
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and placed in a prison camp in Hol<0xC5><0xA1>tínsk, dozens of other Czech Germans followed him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they return home, Czech will be good for them," said Chalupa.
According to him, none of the German prisoners living before the war in Czechoslovakia had expected to be removed from the republic on the basis of the Bene<0xC5><0xA1> decrees.
You don't think you'll pay!
Emotional Campaign Attacks on Drivers
The most expensive event aimed at road safety in Czech history.
However, it would be characterised by an emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ebí<0xC4><0x8D>ka promises to dissuade drivers from dangerous behavior behind the wheel.
The <0x24>150 million campaign will be featured on television, radio, movies, the internet, as well as on airplanes.
It should discourage drivers from fast driving and alcohol at the wheel.
And to remind them to join them before they leave.
He wants to reach the conscience of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what will appear in the flashes?
Mostly human stories that attack emotion.
And this is evidenced by the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
You don't think you'll pay!
The word "don't think" is written in capital letters on a spice.
And in the blood lining there is the word "you pay."
This is meant to symbolize that a person can pay for a moment of inattention with his own life.
Spectators will “fear” the spots until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where pictures with drastic pictures of the victims of accidents can be seen.
It promises to reduce the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by Euro RSCG.
Sugar and steak on the driver
“The drivers have a sugar and beet system.
The sugar for them is that if they go to red, for example, they will save time.
A blow is a threat of punishment or accident.
Drivers need to be reminded of the risk," says Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99>an, transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
And that is why there is a need for information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising, the psychologist says.
Already less efficient are, according to him, boards that warn drivers of danger.
"If a static warning board is installed, it will likely soon merge with the surrounding area and drivers will not take care of it," Kor<0xC4><0x81>n warned.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
Interim Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert expressed his support for the return of virtually all of the occupied territories in 1967, including the Pre-Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He did so in an interview published Monday by the newspaper Jediot Achronot.
“We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that almost all (occupied) territories, if not all, will have to be returned,” Olmert told the newspaper.
“We will keep a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to transfer a similar percentage (Israeli territory) to the Palestinians, because without it there will be no peace,” he added.
He admitted that a possible return would include East Jerusalem as well.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and especially does not want his tractors or bulldozers to pass through his legs, as it happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in a press release on two July attacks.
According to the prime minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, sacred and historic places" that are located inside the Old Town.
“Anyone who wants to maintain Israel’s sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won’t work,” he added.
Departure from the Golan Heights
Olmert also expressed his support for Israel’s withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he believes is an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace deal with Syria.
However, this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of leaving the Golan," he said.
“The Syrians know well what they will have to give up to win the Golans.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with (Shiite) Hezbollah; they will have to give up the permanent support they provide to (Shiite) Hamas, (Terrorist networks) Al-Qaeda and al-Qaeda up.
Question after the accident: Are the drivers on the bus illegal?
The law does not know, not to walk on a long-distance bus
In connection with the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency near Padova, Italy, the question arises whether drivers and passengers can move on the bus while driving.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of the steward is contrary to the road traffic law," said spokesman Karel Hanzelka of the Ministry of Transport.
The accident, in which a twenty-two-year-old steering wheelchair died last week, was apparently caused by a truck driver who crossed the bus.
The girl was unfortunately sitting next to the driver, in the least safe place in the car, although she has two more seats reserved.
However, the bus can crash or stop, even when the waiter distributes coffee or newspapers.
The role is whether the bus is equipped with parking spaces according to the technical certificate.
If it is not approved on the bus, passengers must sit.
The Student Agency’s long-distance buses do not have a place to stop, which Actualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz has also confirmed by the company’s director, Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura.
"This was handled by the ministry and initially did not allow the movement of passengers.
After that, they called back and we got to the point that passengers can walk to the toilet if they have their seat," he said.
The Steward's Law Doesn't Know
"There is no unambiguous legal interpretation of the role of stevard - no legislation addresses this role.
However, no legislation prohibits carriers from providing services.
The Road Transport Act only knows the term guide vehicle; it does not define its rights and obligations,” said Hanzelka.
On the contrary, the head of the Department of Road Vehicles of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, believes that the law treats the issue adequately.
"It depends on whether the bus has a parking space in the type-approval.
That's the end," he says.
The buses are divided into urban, with stops and limited maximum speed, interurban, with stops with the highest permitted speed, and remote, without stops with the highest permitted speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
Like in an airplane, says the expert
BESIP expert on traffic safety Jaroslav Horín does not see a major problem in the movement of steering wheels on board the bus.
"With smooth driving, many dangers are not in danger, the situation can be compared to the service in aircraft.
It’s not even certain when the turbulence will come and the plane may hit its head.”
“But if the bus stopped sharply, of course the laws of physics apply.
As in the city bus or tram.
The security of the guards must be handled by the carrier by internal regulations," he says and also believes, from the point of view of the law, the issue is unresolved.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is willing to cancel the service
The Student Agency offers stewards services as a single bus carrier.
It employs two hundred of them.
Even after the accident, the director does not consider their profession to be risky.
"As soon as I get the impression that the occupation of the guards is risky, I cancel them.
Guests can get coffee and newspapers at check-in.
It would also save costs,” he says.
As an interest in safety, the absence of stewards in his cars was justified by the Director of Asia Alexej Litvin, who operates a fracture of lines compared to SA.
“We don’t have a squad, we’ve been against it from the beginning.
Sooner or later, it will end up in some deadly accident,” he told <0xD0><0x9A><0xD0><0xB8><0xD0><0xB4><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xBD>.cz a few years ago.
There has been an enormous tragedy
A young stevardska from Plze<0xC5><0x88>ska, who worked for the company for two years, died in an accident of line connection to Naples.
The Slovenian truck probably slipped without using the directions from the stopping bar and blocked the way of the bus.
His driver tried to avoid the maneuver, but he slipped into the right front of him.
That two seats reserved for the rest of the stewards would be sold out, Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura refuses.
"These places are not reserved for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
The company intends to sue the truck drivers.
With the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the court order, but also expects financial compensation from the culprit.
Amendment of the law?
In a nutshell
The clarification of the movement of the stewards on board the bus could result in the amendment of the law, on which over a year the thirty-member expert group of the Ministry of Transport works.
“She hasn’t come to a specific conclusion.
Buses do not solve too much, rather the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile when driving," says expert Horín.
"The Ministry of Transportation does not consider the activities of the guards to be something that would substantially jeopardize the safety of passengers," Hanzelka said in a statement, saying that the control of the safety of buses is in the hands of the police and occupational safety authorities.
Düsseldorf's Hope is Frankfurt
There is no shortage of words in the letter from the WestLB’s board of directors to the employees of the bank.
The merger of the units of this Düsseldorf monetary institution with the Frankfurt Deka-Bank will create "the central financial institution of the savings group for trading in capital markets," reads a letter to the public on Monday.
According to the letter, WestLB will enter into this transaction a "set of competences" ensuring long-term returns.
And in any case, such a connection can be a decisive impulse for further associations in the national banking sector.
Such texts arise when the Bureau wants to demonstrate its ability to act in a troubled period.
The unstable WestLB is still under considerable pressure.
Not only on the part of the European Commission, but also on the part of the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority, whose announcement to the state government in North Rhine-Westphalia that it is time to find a solution for the future is still fresh.
However, the connection between Deka-Bank, which customers know of savings for its investment funds, and WestLB, whatever it may be, has been talked about for a long time - even on the Frankfurt side.
Deka-Bank boss Franz Waas said at the end of August that he did not see any meaning in the merger of his banking house from Mainzer Landstraße with one of the country’s banks, such as Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of Deka-Bank, which is responsible for one half of the country’s bank and the other half of the union’s savings fund, commissioned the Board of Directors to conduct discussions with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be about trading on the capital market or part of it.
But the talks have only just begun, financial officials said.
Deka-Bank, one of the most important employers in the Frankfurt financial market with its 3000 employees, is not talking for the first time about consolidation in the savings sector.
In 2003, it seemed that there could be a merger of Deka-Bank with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba bank.
In the end, there was nothing from this triangle.
Shortly after the merger’s plans were made public, the Hessian Land Government opposed the participation of Helaba Bank.
Neither of the other banks are connected.
Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz instead acquired Landesbank Baden-Württemberg from Stuttgart.
Nonetheless, speculation has repeatedly emerged about the connection of Deka-Bank with the world’s banks.
Recently, however, Günther Merl, the chairman of the board of Helaba Bank, has expressed a negative view of speculation about the connection of his financial house to others.
It seems, however, independently, that the convergence of different banking houses in the public sector is a necessity.
Now after the Bavaria parliamentary elections, BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg could be the first to start drawing up a link.
That's not exactly good news for Helaba.
If the pressure for further mergers is to increase, potential partners for such connections are gradually lost.
In the south it would only play second violin, despite the fact that the financial crisis is so far facing significantly better than the banking houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
The association with WestLB was again banned at the beginning of the year by the Association of Savings and Jury Banks Hessen-Thüringen, which holds a fifty-eight percent stake in Helaba.
This would be the most significant Nord LB.
However, geostrategic considerations of this kind are only one side of the problem.
On the other hand, it is a question of how closely the business models of the individual institutions fit together.
In June, Merl said that the decisive question of what business model should be ensured for the future competitiveness of land banks, the German Savings and Jury Banks Union has not yet answered.
It could also end up with the WestLB decommissioning, which, of course, no one wants in this institution.
Therefore, the letter from the local board also mentions that it is seeking a "complex solution" for the entire banking house.
Whether and how it will be possible to connect the individual components with Deka-Bank, will show the time.
The second weekend of the Oktoberfest is known as the “weekend with Italy”
For Elena, it's the first time, for Luca, the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena will be like his girlfriend, and so to speak, everything will be different, she says.
Behind them, at Kaiser’s five-stroke court, stands a stronger whistleblower and two hundred tourists at the Oktoberfest prove how deep the tones can emit his throat.
Elena Luca will first clap and then kiss him.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, from the bus station next to Puerta Nuova station, four buses will leave this evening at 23.45 with the sign "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", expected arrival at 6.30.
Three buses are mainly Italian, one bus is run exclusively by Brazilians.
In one corner of the parking lot, these South Americans are already singing with their flag, already celebrating at night.
And so loud, says Marco Guarda, it's nothing for Italy.
Marc, who wears a long coat with a leather lining and glasses with wide silver rings, the three buses belong.
He has been riding with them for five years at the Oktoberfest, only this year he is organizing three expeditions.
In the night there, through the day between the beer stalls, at 22.30 departure back.
Overnighting would only mean unnecessary costs, says Marco.
The trip costs <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>75 including a welcome invitation to the Kaiser beer, cooked exactly according to the Bavarian Beer Purity Act, Health Insurance and German-speaking guide - Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
Buses leave at night, after the drive towards "Brennero".
Beer is not served, not yet.
The bus is fast silent, the passengers are asleep.
They're doing well, they'll still need their strength.
It is located in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where on the motorway number 8, just before Munich, there is another stop and many other buses with an Italian identification mark.
When Marco’s group finally arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at half-seven in the morning as planned, there are about 50 more buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering, Marco has the last speech, explains the plan of the attack.
First, put on a yellow cap.
On the left is written "Oktoberfest", next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Secondly, "When the door opens to the beer tent, run!" calls Marco into the morning air.
"Run!" Run and occupy seats at the back of the tent.
"Not forward so that you don't obstruct, and not all the yellow hats on the same bench, place them around the space!"
It costs 8 euros, 25 cents.
And don't forget the slippery ones.
"Show the securities that we're behaving decently.
As soon as you leave your seats, they're gone!"
Third, "Tonight at exactly 11:00, come back here!" Do you understand?
And up to Wiesn, a place with beer tents.
On the way, one member of the group hangs yellow hats like badges on trees, cedules and even on a poster of a large Bavarian party.
We need to prepare for retreat.
As "weekend with Italy" is known as the second weekend of the Oktoberfest.
The exact number of visitors is not available; it is said that about 50,000 of those who embark on a journey across the Alps and enter beer tents, 10 percent of all visitors arrived from Italy this weekend.
Numerous Munich police will strengthen seven police officers from southern Tyrol, Italian volunteers will support the Bavarian Red Cross, which runs national statistics, in which Italians before the British (approximately 60 interventions) and Raku<0xC5><0xA1>ana (approximately 80) with approximately 200 local medical centers.
Especially popular among Italians is the Hofbräu tent.
Free nights for lenders Hypo Real Estate
Last week, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed that the German banking system is relatively stable.
It is good that this policy has used the word "relatively" and included the fact that the German banking sector will not be spared from the development of the crisis.
It was the one that happened last weekend.
A finance company specializing in the financing of Hypo Real Estate (HRE) followed by the Dax Index will receive several billion-dollar loans from a consortium of German banks to protect them from turbulence in the markets.
A person familiar with the situation on Monday told Reuters that the credit aid will go up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>35 billion.
The interest will have to be paid by Hypo Real Estate (HRE) only on the amount actually exhausted.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
In the background are the losses of Def's subsidiary.
According to a newspaper report, the state financer refinanced his long-term projects for which he borrowed money in an extremely short period of time, which is no longer possible due to lack of confidence in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s reserve rose by 95 % to EUR 2.37 million and the equity share decreased slightly from 1.6 per cent to 1.45 per cent.
Regular revenues and net revenues from financial transactions fell to zero compared to last year, revenues from the increased value of claims and certain securities, as well as the cancellation of credit trading reserves, fell by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to the higher revenues from the reimbursement of the subsequent accounting costs in the restructuring of the former Deffa Group and from the interest reimbursement under the tax rules and through trade for group companies, the sixteen per cent decrease on the revenue side was still moderate.
After his privatization in 1990, the former state financier burned down on mortgages for businessmen, which were then removed from the portfolio of services and further managed by Aareal Bank.
Since the traditional public funding was too little, Deffa became more involved in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects of private investors and the state (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
From the value of its subsidiary, Hipo Real Estate must now write something down and these depreciations will have a "substantial material effect" on the calculation of the profits and losses of the entire group, as some have been uncertainly heard.
The fact is that there will be no dividends.
In 2007, it was cut by two-thirds.
Hypo Real Estate has been a major financer of state and infrastructure projects since Deffa’s acquisition.
More strongly than other institutions, it relies on refinancing in the interbank market because it has no customer deposits.
After the fall of US investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the source of interbank loans was virtually wiped out because banks are keeping liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs a part of Depf’s loan portfolio – about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 billion – to be refinanced annually.
According to the statement, the group's financial needs are covered by this loan for a period of time and the company is protected "from the influence of international money markets currently to a significant extent of incapacitated functions".
Other sources have heard that these funds will ensure refinancing by the end of 2009.
On the contrary, HRE Chairman Georg Funke said that the Hypo Real Estate Group will not have to use the money markets in the near future.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Financial Services Supervision Institute (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate group in the market is now guaranteed.
Shareholders and creditors of the bank hope so.
But given the dynamics and inaccessibility of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even entirely excluded that the loan should not be fully exhausted.
However, the opposite cannot be excluded.
After the bank on Sunday afternoon seems to have stood before insolvency, it cannot, though preliminary, save the passion.
The share price fell by 75% to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.30.
On the contrary, bond rates were well maintained.
While preferential debts have practically not moved, they lose secondary bond rates more significantly.
This relates in particular to the bonds of the former Württemberg Hypo subsidiary and logically to bonds with maturity after 2009.
Hypo-Real-Estate bonds originally appeared to be an alternative investment opportunity for speculators, but their stability is needed after a significant contraction of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institution itself, which introduced it into the company by the acquisition of Deffa, depending on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as issuing banks, governments and less affected commercial banks are willing to support the system, it is possible to count on the payment of securities within their maturity.
But there can also be something that almost no one dares to hope for now - the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports coming at the same time as this partial nationalisation, the probability limiting certainty has now only become a legitimate hope.
This is especially likely to prepare long-term creditors for a series of waking nights when they will decide whether to give up their commitments.
Short-term investors may use the threshold to at least convert losses from previous accounting periods to exchange rate returns from later years for the purpose of future payment of capital income tax.
Sylvana and the secret of the box Bento
When sixteen-year-old Sylvana Hiltropa introduces herself on her first day of high school in Tachiban, the girls begin to whisper: that German woman is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows this word from the manga. In her new blog about exchange stays, she talks about Japan.
"First day in Japan.
Sir, I was nervous.
I've been stabbed on my way to school.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes by train to central Tachibana.
I had to find my own way, fortunately I didn’t get lost.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Tachibana is not as strictly given as with us at home in Lower Saxony.
Students begin meeting after eight o’clock and twenty minutes before nine, a brief session with a teacher, the so-called ‘home room’, begins.
But even before I started teaching, I had to introduce myself.
I’m not the kind of person who likes to talk in front of people, but in front of a class of 40 students.
Because I hadn’t had a school uniform yet, I wore my host mom’s old skirt, a blouse, blue undercoats and black leather shoes.
So I stood in front of the bench and tried to say everything correctly: 'Sajónara Wo she Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and in a week I have my birthday.
At that point, I was so happy that I started learning the language two years ago.
All 31 girls in the class whispered, whispered, and whispered, and I still heard the word 'kawaii'.
I knew that from my manga.
It belongs to the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls necessary for survival and means 'sweet, sweet'.
Then I quickly jumped into my place.
The girl next to me smiled quite broadly, considered it an honor to have a foreign student sitting next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when the gong called, I was literally asleep.
They were talking to each other and chilling and asking me about the possible and the impossible - and at the same time it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
After the break, they all packed their bents.
My host mom also made me such a lunch box - and that's something other than boring German snacks.
I had rice with herbs, small parsley, cucumber and almond salad, fruit and some fish in a tofu dough.
Most of the time, I don't know exactly what I'm eating here in Japan.
These things look strange and taste quite new.
I'm sure everything's really good.
Well, except for the salty stuffed slices, no!
Benta in Japanese schools is not just lunch.
Sometimes it happens that the girl gives the boy a custom-made bento, which in this case is especially artificially adjusted, and hopes that the boy will get to know more about the break at the breakfast.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I'm wondering if I'll see it here too.
'Why Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
Then I always said,
'Cause I'm just fascinated.'
After all, I’ve loved reading manga for years.
And to better understand these comics and their culture, I started to learn a little Japanese.
It was clear to me that I would have to come here one day.
Because I also have a weakness for tradition, habits and habits.
And they are highly appreciated here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I have never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen."
Rats also have feelings.
When a rat or a frog runs away from danger, does it mean that they also feel fear?
The neurologist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
But how could it be possible to verify that they feel the same when they behave the same way we do?
For several years, the online magazine "Edge" has published contributions from well-known scientists.
In his series, SPIEGEL ONLINE presents the selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else being able to prove it, if we cannot prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope, because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we begin to devote ourselves to a different kind and open up questions of perception or general awareness, we enter into the indifferent terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat gets in danger, he will do the same as many other animals: he will pretend to be dead, flee or attack.
Humans behave similarly, from which some scientists suggest a comparable subjective experience.
I don't believe that, though.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it easier to transfer our subjective experience to the experience of animals.
It is also because the circuits associated with human consciousness almost always include the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its share of short-term memory and executive or control functions).
This vast area is significantly more developed in humans than in other primates, and seems to be completely missing in other creatures.
At least for those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and make decisions, there is reason to assume that man is different even from other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity could be hidden by the linguistic nature of man: because so much of his perception is associated with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on him.
In this case, we could exclude animals.
But even if consciousness did not matter to language, it would certainly be influenced by language, so that animal consciousness, no matter how constructed, would probably differ from most states of our consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what consciousness might look like in other animals.
When, as something internal and subjective, it is not possible to measure or, because of special hardware, to be analyzed on the basis of our own experience, its exploration puts us in great trouble.
Most of my findings relate to the content of the conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be scientifically accessible.
It would be possible to examine processes in the animal consciousness regardless of their contents, and this is exactly what happens in studies of short-term memory in primates, especially for example visualization.
But this approach, devoted to Christof Koch and Francis Crick, focuses more on neural correlations of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: both may be identical, but perhaps they are not.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of nonfrontal cortex for the realization of visualization.
What does it mean for feelings?
I extract them from the fact that the emotional system, such as the fear system, is activated in the brain conscious of its own activity.
What we refer to as “fear” is the mental state in which we are located when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as bodily reactions) uses operational memory.
Viewed from this point of view, the feelings are closely related to those areas of the cortex, which are characterized by primates, and especially people.
In connection with the linguistic nature, a subtle deviation of perception arises, because with the help of words and grammar we can distinguish and categorize states, so that we can attribute them to ourselves and others.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio believes that sensations arise from more primitive activities in the areas of the cortex and brain tribe dedicated to physical sensations, similar to Jaak Pankseep, who, however, focuses more on the brain tribe.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could calmly participate in the feelings perceived by several animal breeds.
Theoretically, I cannot object to this, but I consider it unproven.
Pankseep argues that what we see as fear in rats and humans probably feels the same way both organisms: But how is it possible to verify, Pankseep further says, whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave similarly?
The frog runs away from danger - does he also feel fear?
From my point of view, the mere similarity of behavior cannot prove the consistency of experience.
It is true that the neural comparison moves us further: rats and humans have similar brain strains, but the swan and the brain do not.
But is the brain tribe responsible for feelings?
And even if it was possible to prove it in a human: how would we want to prove it in a rat?
I think that rats and other mammals, maybe even squirrels (who knows?), have feelings.
But I really don't know how to prove it.
And since their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to study emotional behavior rather than the emotional perception of rats.
However, in this case, we can expect progress at the neural level if we measure the same in rats and humans.
Like a rat, I don’t study language and consciousness, I don’t study feelings, because I don’t know if they exist.
It is possible to consider it short-sighted, but I prefer to move forward rather than to throw myself against the wall over and over again.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: Deadline of grace for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunyk said that the preparations will soon be directed directly by the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees the decision of UEFA in Bordeaux as evidence of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize the ME together with Poland," Vasjunyk said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still a lot to be done in both countries.”
In the early fulfillment of the schedule for the construction or redevelopment of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts are stunned.
It is even possible that the number of stadiums for ME will be reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste time anymore.
We must now work as quickly as possible,” said the president of the Ukrainian union, Grigori Surkis.
"UEFA will keep track of us."
An even more radical move was agreed in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish association PZPN was revoked by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlock.
The committee met at the request of Sports Minister Miros<0xC5><0x82>aw Drzewieck<0xC3><0xBD>.
"There is a serious danger that the PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"In a letter to UEFA President Michel Platini, we made sure that the preparations for the 2012 Olympics would not be complete."
Several teams from the first league were only sentenced to a forced drop last season due to manipulations, eventually the start of the league had to be moved quickly.
Rebel Dennis Quaid returns hit
She wanted to advertise a new film, she talked about private affairs – and now she’s having trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan talked about her former Dennis Quaid as a divorce.
He's shaking and hitting back.
The Late War of Roses with ex-married couples Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after the divorce, these two Hollywood actors lead an unpleasant controversy – in the eyes of the public.
In an interview with American magazine InStyle, Meg Ryan said for the first time about the reasons for her marriage's collapse: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and it has been very painful."
The extent of the fraud was reported only after the divorce.
The inspiration for this mental striptease was Ryan's PR work for her new film "The Women" - the story of a broken marriage.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his presentation as an unfaithful husband was pronounced: He's "crazy," the 40-year-old actor of the New York Daily News said that "Meg is repeatedly reviving the history of our relationship and editing it."
In addition, it is "condolences" that the sixteen-year-old son, Jack, is again "publicly reminiscent of the pain and radical changes that divorce is for every child."
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently became the father of twins.
He concludes his considerations of oblivion as follows: “My life goes on anyway.
I think I’m happy to have an amazing family that’s doing great.”
Prices of flights and hotels are falling
In the first half of 2008, flights and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, flights were even up to 50 percent cheaper, according to one recent study.
Flights and accommodation at hotels have again been discounted - this is the result of a study by American Express travel and financial services provider.
The company analyzed its data on bookings made in the first half of 2008 and after price increases in the first quarter, it found their significant decline in the second quarter.
After several years of rising prices in the hotel market, accommodation in many places has already been discounted.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities monitored continued to rise by an average of 6.9% compared to 2007.
However, from April to June prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The most striking trend was in Paris and Rome, where passengers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than in the previous year.
American Express considers the weak exchange rate of the dollar to be the cause of this trend, which has caused “the declining appetite of American tourists to travel.”
The decline in hotel prices also affected financial centres more strongly than industrial centres such as Hannover, Cologne on the Rhine or Stavanger.
In this Norwegian city, hotel prices rose by 26.3 percent and even recorded a European record.
Airline prices also showed an upward trend in the first quarter:
Due to kerosene irrigation, passengers in the Economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, with up to 29.2 percent being fueled by long-distance flights.
From April to June, the prices of flights in the Economy class fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in the Business and First-Class classes, the changes in knowledge were less significant.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more sharply than in other European countries:
From January to March, they increased by 11.9 percent, and in the second quarter they decreased by 23.6 percent.
During the German national years, prices fell by half, according to the study.
One of the reasons for this price drop is slowing economic growth, the company explains.
Demand in many segments of the air transport market is uncertain.
On the other hand, due to the Open Skies agreement, which liberalized air traffic between the United States and Europe, there is increased competitive pressure.
A sign of the tense situation is the disruption of non-profit airlines by air carriers and also the high number of airlines that declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - only in Europe there were 24 airlines.
HSV defeated Gladbach 1:0
Thanks to one brand and simple methods, the Hamburger SV is at the forefront of the table.
In Borussia, Luhukay is still unable to compile a working eleventh.
Written by Kristoffer Klein - Enlarge the unsuccessful landing for representative Marko Marina.
This player from Gladbach got involved in the game until late and failed with a balloon on the stick.
His message was precisely formulated and came out of his mouth convincingly.
He just knew he was right.
"We need a second goal," said Hermann Rieger in the hallway to the Hamburg Arena cabins.
There was a lot going on in the catacombs, the half-hour break was over, and most people were sitting in their seats again.
Rieger has been a HSV physiotherapist for almost three decades and enjoys more respect than many momentary actors.
And so his request was also heard in a responsible place.
Trainer Cornelius Jol's assistant pulled and raised his thumb to the sign of agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's head coach Martin Jol.
His order probably sounded similar: here with a second goal!
There was no implementation.
"It didn't look good here today," admitted Marcell Jansen later.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have been "desired to be more relaxed."
For 1:0 (1:0) Hamburgers owe head Mladen Petri<0xC4><0x87> (11.) and circumstances that very weak Gladba<0xC5><0xA1>an could not hurt weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summed up.
Hamburger SV will celebrate 121 years of its existence on Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, the spectators celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and a lively updated table on the video wall, in which their team was listed as the premier.
It'll be a birthday without a good party.
"We know how to evaluate it," said Marcell Jansen.
He speculates that the continuous table result symbolizes the league's incompetence rather than the dominance of its HSV.
The team with the late arrival of new players - the Brazilians Nevese and Silva, the goalkeeper Petri<0xC4><0x87>e and the FC Bayern acquired Jansen - is slowly located, but is not yet able to shine.
"We need more feeling and more dribbling," Jol said.
After losing in voting
There is fear on Wall Street.
The first reports of a rescue package flooded the Dow Jones index by up to 700 points.
It was the biggest point loss in one day in his history.
Later, Dow brought something back.
Around 20:30, this world’s most important stock exchange barometer showed a 5% drop to 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was more than seven percent minus at 1548 points.
The worst of it was in Dow at the moment American Express, which lost almost 14 percent, and Bank of America with a loss of about twelve percent.
None of the titles were able to strengthen.
Goldman Sachs’ shares have lost nearly 10%.
A few days ago, large-scale investor Warren Buffett had a stake in the company.
As part of the bailout plan, funds are to be made available for the purchase of so-called corrupt mortgage securities.
However, the full amount should not be paid at once, but in several stages.
In return, the State should receive the stock options lists of financial companies, which could be paid in favour of the exchange rate development, thereby reducing the burden on the state budget.
Stock prices in Europe are falling sharply
The billion-dollar aid to banks in Europe and the United States does not free investors from doubts.
The stock price of the major German bank Hipo Real Estate is strongly declining and pulls the Dax index with it.
The Dow Jones Index is losing despite the state’s planned savings.
Spectacular exchange losses between Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have thrown the German stock index (Dax) deep down.
Shares of Munich’s financial real estate have lost up to three-quarters of its value despite savings by the federal government and private banks, and Commerzbank has lost more than 20 percent.
Dax clearly slipped below the psychologically important 6,000 point limit and recorded 5,839 points with a minus of 3.7 percent.
Across the world, stock markets have fallen to their knees.
In New York, the business day on Wall Street began with significant losses.
Investors are concerned that the US government’s <0x24>700 billion bailout package would not be enough to revive the financial markets.
Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent during the first hour of trading, reaching 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives is due to vote on a bailout plan, the Senate may vote on October 1.
The rest of Europe’s stock exchanges went in only one direction: in London, the FTSE index first weakened by 3.2 percent, the CAC-40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the Japanese leading Nikkei index fell by 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 units after initial gains.

Private bank Sal. Oppenheim has acquired 23 million new shares.
The business and tourism group has also announced that it will not sell shares in Thomas Cook.
Dark matter affects the flight of space probes
For years, scientists have not been able to cope with one mysterious phenomenon: dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity might not be entirely correct.
For almost 18 years, the Ulysses spacecraft has been flying in space.
Because of the fuel lines, which will soon freeze, she is now in danger of dying in the winter.
One mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion among scientists for years - the anomaly of the gravitational beam.
A gravitational practice is the aerial maneuver of space probes, in which they acquire additional gravity in the gravitational field of a cosmic body, such as the Earth.
Thanks to this, the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the solar probe Ulysses.
But what scientists have been saying for years in this case is surprising: flying bodies do not behave 100 percent as one would expect according to the old good law of gravity.
On the contrary, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes unexpectedly accelerate or slow down.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
He was baptized as an anomaly of gravitational shock.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity, which describes the attractiveness of matter by curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton is still convinced that Einstein was not mistaken, and is trying to explain the anomaly of gravitational rays using the so-called dark matter, whose presence in the universe has been discovered by astronomers.
“The one responsible for this anomaly could be the dark matter, which could also be very close to Earth,” he writes.
Space researchers have only known about the existence of dark matter for about a decade.
It is apparently based on gravitational force, the effect of which can be observed on other cosmic bodies.
On the contrary, it itself is completely invisible, which means that it does not emit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, not even visible light.
Scientists estimate that this dark mass makes up about one-fifth of the total mass of the universe.
In Egypt, the kidnapping of tourists is free
After 10 days in the hands of their kidnappers, the Italian foreign minister said that tourists in Egypt are being kidnapped again.
The Sudanese kidnappers demanded a ransom of several million euros.
Six kidnappers were reportedly killed in the shooting before being released.
Five Germans were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
The Redemption negotiations are already underway.
The Germans have repeatedly become the target of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE brings you the most important cases.
European tourists travelling to the Sahara are free.
It was reported by Egyptian state television, Al-Arabiya Arab TV station and Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release, according to the TV station Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been released.
We're just checking their health," Frattini said.
According to Egyptian state television, five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian guides, are safe and secure.
All 19 participants of the expedition to the desert are already on their way to Cairo.
The background of the shooting remains unclear before the hostages were released: according to an Egyptian security worker, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping even before the Sudanese army killed six kidnappers.
"The problem has been solved.
They agreed to the ransom,” the employee said.
"It was all about taking over the hostage," he said, when suddenly the "surprise" came.
Sudanese troops shot six kidnappers and arrested two of them in a border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday.
The kidnappers demanded a ransom of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 million for Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" with appeals to one of the German mediators said the release of the hostages was being delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers wanted to release female hostages after paying the ransom.
The men should be held until the kidnappers have a safe escape.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to comment on the report.
Abusing Fathers 'Leaded to Suicide'
Several years of fatherly abuse led a woman to commit suicide, the court heard.
After confessing to eight cases of sexual harassment, 70-year-old Michael Treris of Stithians in Cornwall was sentenced to six years.
The Crown Court in Truro heard that his unborn daughter, Stephanie Randle, was regularly bound when she was between the ages of five and seven.
"I feel responsible for her death," Trerise wrote in a confession.
It was also reported in court that Ms. Randle committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise tied her up and tied her eyes and then sexually abused her while her mother worked in the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and returned to Cornwall.
His uncle's daughter went to Plymouth.
But before the trial, it was heard that Mrs. Randle, who had spent a substantial part of her time volunteering for the National Trust, was harassed by the ghost of abuse that had been committed to her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife said in 2006 that friends of Ms. Randle, who was also very involved in surfing and cycling, said she was "emotionally dead" and "abandoned her life."
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is believed that she was suffocated with a gellit bag.
Randle stood face to face with his daughter’s unowned father, who wrote a confession that ended with the words: “I tied her and tied her eyes.
"I didn't abuse her.
I feel responsible for her death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen Treris said: “You are an extremely strange fetishist and it must have been terrible for your victim when she was only seven years old.
“This unpleasant story ends with the victim taking his life.
Even more awful is the fact that if she hadn’t done so, she probably wouldn’t have come to court at all.”
"In particular, I would like to emphasize the consequences that Stephanie's parents think your crime has had on their daughter over the years," he added.
"Obviously, otherwise, she would probably be a promising, successful, and happy young woman."
The officer who lost the data will be charged.
The BBC reported that a government official, who left strictly secret documents on the train in June, would be charged under the State Secrets Act.
The man left two highly classified documents on a train at Waterloo when he was temporarily assigned to the Ministry of Defence.
The documents, before they were handed over to the police, were handed over to the BBC.
It is the least serious offence against the aforementioned law and there is no indication of criminal intent.
BBC Defence correspondent Frank Gardner said such a move would be surprising to many in Whitehall.
“They probably thought the matter was going to be resolved internally between the ministry and the Government Office,” he said.
An employee who may not be appointed is charged under section 8.1 of the relevant Act, which is a clause dealing with the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecutor recommended the Metropolitan Police to appeal to the official on the basis of the very sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he had forgotten contained secret analyses of al-Qaeda and the possibilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was moved from home to an unknown location.
Social backups face debt B&B
British cooperative backups may have to deal with more than <0xC2><0xA3>80 million in debt after the rescue of Bradford & Bingley.
The government has provided 2.6 million clients with <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion to protect deposits in Bradford & Bingley.
Interests on this loan will be paid to all companies that receive client deposits, including 59 cooperative foundations.
Adrian Coles, CEO of the Association of Cooperative Foundations (BSA), said it was “humble” that backups and their members had to pay.
Fourteen billions of debt will eventually be repaid by saving the Bradford & Bingley mortgage.
In the meantime, the interest will be paid to all 700 financial companies that receive client deposits each year.
The Financial Services Compensation Plan for the BBC confirmed that all 59 cooperative bases are included in this figure.
It is humiliating that these institutions, which have behaved with dignity... now have to pay off some of the accounts of those institutions that were far from so respectable.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company should pay in proportion to the deposits it held, and that deposits should pay about 18% of the price.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the debt interest rate will rise to <0xC2><0xA3>450 million in 2009.
This means that depositors will have to find <0xC2><0xA3>81 million to pay interest from the first year.
Adrian Coles, chief executive officer of the trade association Cooperative Foundation, told the BBC that he was convinced that it was not fair.
“It is humiliating that those institutions that behaved in a respectful manner during the expansion of the housing market now have to pay some bills of those institutions that were by far less respectful.”
According to the BSA, no backups have fallen since 1945, when they appeared.
“We’ll have to explore all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what are the possibilities to protect collaborative backups and their members from an account that could be significant,” Cole said.
The interest payable in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September to the end of March.
In 2010, interest will be paid for the whole year and that could be almost twice as much.
Since cooperative deposits are shareholders of organizations without shareholders, this account will eventually be paid by their members through higher fees or lower interest rates on their accounts.
Milk station for five pence per liter
People in Jersey may have to pay more for milk.
The Jersey dairy company has announced that it will increase the wholesale price of its milk by five pence per litre from Monday.
This is the second price increase this year, after a two-percent increase in February, and comes after the research carried out by the advisory company.
Retailers have to decide for themselves whether they want to reflect the irritation in customer prices.
Prior to the February increase, the wholesale price of milk from Jersey last changed in 2002.
Securities for Bangladeshi Prime Minister Rejected
A Bangladeshi court rejected former Prime Minister Shajj Hasina Vajjidova's request for bail, which means that if she returns to her homeland, she may be arrested.
Her lawyers said the court refused to release her on bail in connection with the accusation that she had received more than <0x24>729,700 from a certain businessman by extortion when she was prime minister.
The case is one of several corruption allegations that have been filed against her.
Khalida Zija, a longtime political rival <0xC5><0xA0>ajch Hasina, was released earlier this month on bail.
Sheikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh within the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami League, has demanded that the local military government give her full freedom first.
The correspondents say that while she has been discharged for an honorary term in order to undergo a medical operation abroad, it is not clear under the conditions of her release whether she will remain free until she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say she is now appealing to the Supreme Court against the Supreme Court’s order.
“The Supreme Court rejected Shah Hasina’s application for bail with the fact that she does not need a bail when she is already undergoing an investigation abroad for an honest statement,” her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said.
"We will appeal against the Supreme Court's order."
Her lawyers said she needed a bailout so she could return from abroad to the country in preparation for the December election.
The High Representative of the League of People said Shajch Hasina is due to return home after October 17.
She was detained last year after the military-held interim government took power, but was released from prison in June to go abroad for medical intervention.
Shaikh Hasina and Khalid Zijáova both reject all charges against each other.
Fear of Vaccination in Reverse Infection in Afghanistan
According to the United Nations, nearly 200,000 children have not participated in the recent round-the-clock vaccination against back-to-back violence associated with the Taliban.
The U.N. carried out vaccinations in six provinces last week.
However, she said she was unable to reach the children in the southern parts of Helmand and Kandahar for safety reasons.
A U.N. spokesman said this happened despite Taliban promises that thousands of vaccinated workers will not be attacked or defended at work.
BSkyB loses court dispute over ITV
BSkyB lost the dispute over the review of the Commission’s competition decision, which ordered the company to reduce its share in the competitive broadcasting company ITV.
The Court of Appeal for Competition ordered BSkyB to reduce its share of ITV from 17,9 % to under 7,5 %.
The Commission had previously stated that BSkyB’s share had a competitive struggle and had given ITV a disproportionate impact.
BSkyB bought a share in 2006 in the store, which as a result prevented NTL, now renamed to Virgin Media, ITV from buying.
In April 2007, the Fair Trade Authority announced that the acquisition of a stake in ITV by BSkyB had raised doubts about the independence of ITV, and called on the Commission for Competition to initiate an investigation.
The head of the Virgin consortium, Sir Richard Branson, the Consumer Organization and the regulator of Ofcom were all against buying.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction in its share of ITV was unreasonable and disproportionate as a solution - mainly because BSkyB had previously said that it was willing to give up its voting rights.
New Investigation of U.S. Lawyers’ Affair
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the release of nine U.S. lawyers in 2006.
Tah came into a situation where the report on the affair prepared by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Justice criticized the activities of government officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Justice Minister Albert Gonzales.
The investigation was prompted by fears that the lawyers were removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether officials interrogated during the investigation lied to investigators in order to deprive them of justice.
Inspector General Glenn Fine said: "The serious allegations, including potential criminal offences, have not been fully investigated or explained."
The appointment of a special prosecutor with the authority to donate witnesses was one of his key recommendations.
The dispute began when the U.S. Department of Justice deposed nine U.S. lawyers in December 2006.
At the time, the ministry said that the lawyers were released due to poor performance.
However, later it turned out that the lawyers’ releases were not evaluated worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to conclude that the release was politically motivated.
Some of the lawyers were involved in prosecution of high-ranking Republican MPs and senators, while others refused to investigate allegations of voter fraud against Democrats.
U.S. lawyers are investigating and conducting lawsuits against the government.
They may be released at any time, but they may not be removed for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice, Minister Alberto Gonzales, was fired for his pardon and eventually resigned.
The number of other representatives of the Ministry of Justice also resigned.
The inspector-general's report was very critical of Gonzales' role in the affair, saying he was "mainly responsible" for apologizing for having "abdicated" from his leadership position and not "significantly engaged" in the matter.
Other officials, including former senior Bush adviser Karl Rove, have been criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
Meat Loaf’s Commander-in-Chief Will Be Appreciated
Rock star Meat Loaf will receive one of the Q Awards for her epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will come to the ceremony next weekend in London for his special gold award, said he was "honored" by the recognition he received.
The song, which lasted nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
This year’s nomination is led by Coldplay, which has been selected in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q Magazine, said: "There are some songs that stand above things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is definitely one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, needed large vocals provided by Meat Loaf.
The instrumental part began, which lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released in the UK in 1979 as a single and peaked at 15th place.
But Meat Loaf's album Bat Out Of Hell has been on the chart for about nine years and has sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - the real name of Marvin Lee Aday - suffered from health problems in recent years, and in 2003 was operated on due to irregular heart rhythm after crashing on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Later it turned out that he had a cyst on his vocal cords.
Obscurious streets, often forgotten and perhaps soon on sale
New York City has thousands of roads, streets, highways and other ground transportation, some famous, others only utility.
But also many taxi drivers-veteran and longtime locals have trouble finding Extra Place, mostly because they have never heard of it.
This little street is in the East Village district and leads north from First Street - without getting to Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
With a width of about ten and a length of forty meters, it is more like a dusty passage than a traffic move.
There are no cedulars with street names.
In the ordinary atlas, it is virtually invisible.
Still, the street has admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a developer of newly built luxury buildings on First Street.
Extra Place wants to reopen and create a cleaner passageway to shops and boutiques to open in new buildings.
Other admirers are long-time neighbors who say they were enchanted by the shortened street simply because it was one of the last remnants of the time before the block was refined.
However, the City Office for the Protection and Development of the Building, which has the street in its power, has no interest in sticking to it.
At a meeting of the land committee of the municipal community, representatives of the city council and Avalon Bay company drafted a plan according to which the developer should buy the street.
However, according to Suzan Stetzer, District Manager of the Commonwealth 3, the committee prefers a variant where the streets remain in the hands of the city, and requested a new plan to be presented next month.
"The city already owns very few lands, and we would like Extra Place to remain in its ownership," she said.
“Repair and administration proposals could be made, which Avalon could do, but we also want to guarantee public access.”
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that it wants to reopen the small street and seize seats, several of which would be used by a cafe whose interest in leasing space the developer expects.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first published at a meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the street, it does not necessarily want to own it.
“The main intention of Avalon Bay is to repair this deserted street and make it a beautiful place for the public,” she said, adding that the sale was designed by the city.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Building Conservation Office, said the city really wanted to sell the street, and pointed out that his office’s task is to develop property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a slight mark in history.
Some people think that the street got its name in 1802, when Philip Minthorn's large farm was divided among several of his children and no one claimed that narrow strip of land.
The CBGB, a punk rock monument that closed in 2006, led to the Extra Place, and the street is perhaps best known as the backdrop of the photo on the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia".
“This place was amazing,” says Danny Fields, Ramones’ manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was full of rubbish, torn clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some locals, including bloggers who are writing about the refinement of the East Village neighborhood, are opposed to the idea of selling Extra Place and claiming that that piece of public property, though secret, should remain public.
Others consider Extra Place a rarity - an almost unchanged piece of the city that should be left as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who writes a blog in the name of Jeremiah's missing New York (under the subtitle "The Book of Quests: A Horrible Nostalgic View of the City in the Process of Extinction"), hung a part of the Extra Place story from the section We Talk About the City, which appeared in The New Yorker's 19th Anniversary.
The article's author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow, blind street, dark even in the daytime, bounded by iron-cut warehouse doors and enclosed windows, where a week old newspaper is spent in bars."
Except for a few exceptions, the street of one recent evening looked exactly the same.
The crossing took place across the blind end of the street near the door that once led to the CBGB, where today there is a expensive clothing store.
There were graffiti on the walls and next to a fresh dose of newspapers was an empty bottle of beer.
A couple of those who walked around said they rarely thought of Extra Place, but suggested that some suspension might be suitable for him.
On the contrary, Fields said he thinks some people underestimate the influence of the street in its present state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "were in dark, wet and nasty places."
Debate on bilinguality: immersion in English
In this issue, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi will discuss the position of candidates for bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an academic from California and director of education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book “Better Than You Think: Why a Middle Class Needs to Choose Schools.”
Efficiently addressing Spanish voters is a tricky matter.
Barack Obama’s education agenda just proves that.
Obama’s campaign notes that “Afro-American and Spanish students are significantly less likely to get to college than white students,” which is true.
To combat such performance disparities, Obama’s education agenda is endorsed in particular, among other things, “transitional bilingual education” for those who are just learning English.
However, Barack Obama’s question remains whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes the use of languages other than English in the classroom, is not stronger than his interest in reducing performance differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, a charter primary school in the East Los Angeles district.
Students of this school are, in most cases, Hispanics from low-income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have only recently arrived, are only learning English.
Nevertheless, in state mathematics tests in 2008, the highest level of the incredible 100 percent of fourth grade students.
Almost equally astonishing ninety-three percent of fourth grade students reached the highest level in state tests in English language and literature.
This incredible success has been achieved by a method other than the one Obama prefers.
Sixth Street emphasizes control and exercise, continuous abilities assessment, and an apologetic approach.
Further, and this should be noticed by Obama, according to Linda Mikels, the director of Sixth Street, the school's educational approach for those who are just learning English is "complete immersion".
Diving into English emphasizes the almost privileged use of English in teaching.
Ms. Mikels, who is against bilingual education, told me, "We've had a tremendous success with a brand-new student from Mexico - after twelve months you'd be in class and you wouldn't know who it is."
"It works," she said, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school as the Sixth Street Prep as a model of what other schools with a large share of Spanish and English students should look like?
The results achieved by the school should make the answer to this question self-evident, but the educational agenda of its own party (National Education Association is a longstanding advocate of bilingual education) and its own coherent pre-educational support.
While Obama agrees that immigrants should learn English, things have recently been trivialized when he said people should stop worrying about "only English" laws.
Instead, “you should make sure that your children speak Spanish,” he said.
If Obama really wants to erase performance disparities, he should think carefully about the educational patterns that work, rather than ridicule them and trivialize them.
Oil drops sharply due to renewed economic concerns
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday because of fears that even the U.S. plan to save the financial markets would not have to revive the economy.
Oil prices fell by 7 percent to <0x24>99.80 per barrel in early morning trading on the New York Commodity Exchange.
Prices have fallen by more than <0x24>20 per barrel since last Monday.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by financial turmoil on Wall Street, as well as by two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a peak of <0x24>145.29 per barrel in July, prices fell to almost <0x24>90 per barrel earlier this month, jumping back into a wave of huge uncertainty in the financial markets.
Anxiety struck investors again on Monday, even after the Congressional Presidency announced that it had reached an agreement on the biggest rescue plan in history over the weekend.
This report has been obscured by fresh fears that the financial crisis is far to the end.
In the latest episode of the ongoing breakdown, the government announced that Citigroup would buy a banking division of Wachovia Corporation.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said the angry weekend talks that led to a plan to save the economy "shown to be unable to revive the mood in the market."
As the economic situation worsens, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to decline.
“The swings for markets with global stocks, interest rates and exchange rates have greatly weakened,” analysts at Deutsche Bank wrote in a report to investors.
“We believe that commodities will not be able to escape infections.
“From a commodity perspective, our biggest concern is to what extent the American virus is spreading across the world and especially to China.”
Analysts of the bank reduced their expectations for next year as oil consumption declined due to slower economic growth, and lowered their forecasts for gasoline prices for 2009 by about 20 percent.
The wild ride in the second quarter beats the team’s record
After spending the last eight seasons in the Jets suit more than anyone else, defensive player Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
Then on Sunday, he watched the development of the second quarter, in which the Jets turned a pointless game into a sleepy ride.
"I've never seen anything like that," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals faced the post-mortem mists over each other with their turbulent game.
Then quarterback Brett Favre sent Laveranuese Coles to a twelve-year touchdown sprint, perfectly predicting an afternoon in which their gradually developing cooperation moved a mile forward.
Favre sent Coles in this quarter behind the other two touchdowns, including the one in which the cornerback fell, and another 10 seconds before the half-game.
"It was nothing extraordinary," Favre said of all his recordings to Coles.
"He's a fucking good player.
We communicated very well, no matter what people think.”
While Favre and Coles fought, the defense attacked quarterback Cardinals Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darelle Revis caught the crazy hound and returned it 32 yards to the touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith typing another tape and catching it.
Linebacker David Bowens donated Warner to the fumble.
The last loss of the ball, the fumble Bowens forced, was perhaps the best.
The Cardinals reached the ball 10 seconds before the end, and after the Jets won the ball back, Jay Feely scored a twenty-three-yard goal from the field, earning a 34-0 lead.
That's the most the Jets got in one quarter.
Jets coach Eric Mangini, when he was called to describe the madness, said, "The second quarter, or the third quarter?"
When he was told that the Jets had given him 21 points in the third quarter without an answer, Mangini said, "I can tell you that I enjoyed the second quarter much more than the third.
Many points have fallen in a short period of time.”
Relaxed Gebreselassie has improved his world record
Haile Gebreselassie from Ethiopia once again showed why many consider him the best long-distance runner of all time when he broke his own world record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and became the first person to run 26.2 miles and run a minute under the ice.
By winning on a pleasantly flat track at 2:03:59, he overcame his previous time of 27 seconds at 2:04:26, which ran last year in Berlin.
The 35-year-old Gebreselassie set the 26th world record of his career, which is truly incredibly wide-ranging – he has broken the world record or is at least a world champion at all distances from metric mile to marathon.
Gebreselassie missed the Olympic Marathon in Beijing last month because he was afraid – perhaps too frightened from the backstage – that polluted air would irritate his asthma problems.
Instead, he promised to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at start, 55 degrees at goal - he won on Sunday Gebreselassie with a flashy average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As track runners like Gebreselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya focused on a longer run, the marathon record in the past decade has fallen by more than two minutes since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday’s victory, Gebreselassie told reporters that he had a cramp two weeks ago and missed a week of training.
Apparently, the pause woke him rather than delayed.
"I'm so happy," Gebreselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago and I was a little in doubt today, but everything was fine.”
He was also criticized - especially in Kenya, East African rival Ethiopia - for saying he overplanned his races, generally avoided the world marathon peaks, relied on drivers, as if it were a race on the road, a race on the world track.
But this criticism can hardly reduce Gebreselassie's huge running quality.
Maintained at the pace of the four Kenyans, Gebreselassie reached halftime at 1:02:04.
After the drivers dropped, Gebreselassie was constantly chased by two elite Kenyan runners James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi.
About three miles before the Gebreselassie goal, he last took and ran to Kwambai, who then took second place at 2:05:36, thereby improving his personal maximum by almost five minutes.
Kamathi finished third at 2:07:48.
In the women’s race, a great year ended with the 7th fastest time in history 2:19:19 Irina Mikit<0xC4><0x9B>nková, a Kazakh woman who is now a German national.
The record time 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliffe from the UK.
Thirty-six-year-old Mikitchenko was surprisingly successful last spring in the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She missed the Beijing Games because of something that was described as a back injury, but recovered and won in Berlin and in the third marathon she ever ran, she improved her personal maximum by almost five minutes.
She ran the race cleverly and thoughtfully: she let four Ethiopian and Kenyan runners escape in a big jump and then reached them after about 18 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia finished second at 2:21:31 and Helene Kipropová from Kenya finished third at 2:25:01.
Pride and Barriers to Black Lives in a Separate City
Hidden among the expansive amusement parks of Greater Orlando, a few miles from all the shiny, noisy and huge, lies a quiet city in which the pride and demands of African American life are revived.
Eatonville, the first completely black city to be incorporated into the state and where Zora Neale Hurston spent her childhood, is no longer as simple as it was described in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet toys, three hundred brown skins, three hundred rows of wood, and three hundred rows of wood."
Now it's a deserted place.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Eatonville Festival Zora! to celebrate Hurston, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
The city she described remains a part of, though she made it a stop for tourists by including it in a Florida tourist guide created by the Federal Writers project during the economic crisis.
It is still as independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted and did not share their true feelings with a white man who "knows so little about us that he doesn't even know what's going to happen."
Even today, in a year when Black presidential candidate Senator Barack Obama calls for an open discussion of races, many of the inhabitants of the country remain cautious about foreign views.
"We're paying close attention to how our story is told," says 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who lives here from birth and is a member of the oldest parish in the city.
"It must be right."
Eatonville has long been characterized as a paradox of triumph and effort.
It is both a historical model of the Black Rise and a community of nearly 2,400 people, where the poverty rate is twice as high as the national average.
It is a center of literature, but also a shaded example of South African rural Black culture – sometimes despised, sometimes praised – that originated from American slavery.
It is not surprising that the people here are both proud and protective.
And the worries about Eatonville's idea really started with Zora, which is the only way Hurston is called here.
She introduced her hometown to the world through heartfelt books full of speeches such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
The five paragraphs of the Florida Tourist Guide transformed the city a bit into Route 17, which leads through Florida’s often overlooked center, into a stage of Black history and human drama.
With a big drum break in life and literature, Hurston introduced readers to the store of the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clark, and then turned to more personal places.
"Left by the road," she wrote, "is a white-brown modern national school with well-maintained courtyards and playgrounds that Howard Miller always cared about, even though he can't read or write much."
She also mentioned the new husband of Dash's widow and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and anything that fits into the hourly hotel."
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston linked Eatonville to self-government, but also to anecdotalism, marriage reopening, and sex.
This was obviously not Fodor's typical publishing house.
In fact, it was not a portrait that everyone would appreciate.
"Again, she said it the way it was," says 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls, who made Hurston immortal by quoting men who sang rough songs about their beauty.
"Some people didn't like it," she added.
Hurston is still remembered here as a chip center, which often returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, aged seventy-seven, remembers that most of the time when she arrived in the city, she arrived without notice in the huge Chevrolet, she smoked and wore pants in the city, which is still proud to wear.
The majority of the population was fascinated, Franklin said, but many were stunned.
"The people of Zora have always liked to see," Franklin said.
But, he added, she's hovering on a chair on the back terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were removed from the press.
It seemed that Eatonville had forgotten her along with the rest of the world.
Although she was once a literary star, the current Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an undisclosed grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she previously lived.
There were no major mourning ceremonies or large public readings in Eatonville.
“I don’t think they understood either its significance to the world or its reference at all,” said Valerie Boyd, author of Hurston’s 2003 biography Wrapped in Rainbows.
The change came in the 80s of the 20th century.
Orange County officials wanted to stretch the city through a five-course highway instead of Kennedy Boulevard, which is the local two-course main road.
The departure of Orlando has already pushed Interstate Highway 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still recovering from a complex historical period.
Forced integration, along with other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of this community.
In the 1950s, the struggle for racial hatred brought hatred to the threshold of the community.
"At that time, a bunch of white boys, they came and threw oranges and things on the people sitting on the side," Franklin said.
“We actually had a woman here who killed her.
They got out of the car with melons."
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston challenged the Supreme Court's demand for forced integration and declared that his decision in Brown v. the House of Education was "injurious to my race rather than celebrating."
Residents now claim that school desegregation, although positive in some areas, has reduced the cohesion in Eatonville and undermined the courage of young people there.
"Black kids were used to hugging - I remember - you hugged your teacher in the morning, you hugged your teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Elly Dinkins and executive director of the nonprofit group Preserve the Eatonville Community.
It lasted until the teachers and students came from the same place, she added.
"You're not taking your white teacher because your white teacher - I mean, there's a cultural barrier," said Ms. Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, helped create a space for many more Zora Neale Hurston - Black writers, actors, and artists who like her have risen above prejudices with light-hearted self-confidence and quotes such as "How can anyone vampire the delight of my presence!
I don't understand that."
In 1975, Alice Walker traveled to Hurston's undetermined grave and began to fight for the revival of her reputation.
Five years later, Hurston's famed biography of Robert E. Hemenway, who re-listed it to the U.S. canon, fell to the shelves in bookshops.
The highway project arrived at the moment when Eatonvillu’s most famous daughter found the lights of the ramp again.
The former Hurston neighbours now regarded her as a savior.
To show what could happen to its highway, the community began planning the Hurston Festival in 1988.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January many return to the celebration.
After a few years, the state resigned from the highway design.
"These five currents of the highway would rise, you would say, it exploded directly, real civil pride," said Nathiri.
Boyd simply said, "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the highway project helped to change the image of the city.
Aliens such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began attending the church in 1993, began to appear in larger numbers, and residents began to re-evaluate the past.
Eatonville joined the National Historical Register in 1998.
The new one-story library (named after Hurston, of course) was opened in 2006 for the re-wasp and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: just six miles from downtown Orlando can sometimes act as a falling street in summer rain, as small as when it was founded with only 27 Black families in the 1980s.
(Today it is 90 percent black.)
With strangers who come to look for the story and meaning of Eatonville, it is still often treated with caution.
Permission for most interviews is required in advance and certain things - such as wall paintings in the oldest Eatonville church painted by whites and depicting blacks on the fields - should not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Jones, a brave, self-confident teacher who likes the red one, are still afraid that their isolated community will not be properly understood.
And even as the Hurston festival expanded, home pride also increased.
Especially young people want to see Eatonville the way Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, with problems and so on, but not better, not worse and as proud, creative, working, foolish and diverse as other American races and ethnicities.
Franklin's nephew, eighteen-year-old Edwin Harvey, sounds sincere love for the community when he plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or the police, which he says would need some help.
And even younger ones, such as the 11-year-old twins from Winter Park Alondra and Alexia Kenon, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, when they just walk through here, think, 'Hmm, this city is nothing against the others,'" Alondra Kenon said recently on Sunday after church.
"But if you really stop and look at history for a moment, it's a very nice city."
Here in New York, we're all talking financially.
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from newspaper stands and twisted TV screens on Times Square, they wouldn’t realize they’re standing in the middle of a storm.
They would never assume that in the stained beehive, the offices have the role of bankers and investment fund managers who monopolize New York, the worst "bad day in the office" since the crisis of 1929.
The coworkers are still chasing metal trolleys on the sidewalks and transfer bakers of muffins to the breakfast meeting.
The Spaniards continue to move between the towers and wear, like human mules, fifty burned shirts hanging from the waxes on their backs.
Office rats are still waiting in front of their morning bagel at the street food stalls, and it is still not possible to get a yellow taxi on a daily basis between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m.
It didn’t look like a crisis at all until I, with all the words about pessimism, decided to set up a savings account on Thursday afternoon.
Despite the fact that I had timed this assignment to cover up with the late afternoon sitting at my local JP Morgan Chase branch, there were already about twenty people waiting in the front.
Not in front of the checkout windows to pick up or store cash, but in front of a crossroads where older clients order checkbooks, tourists ask for a trip to the Macy's mixed goods store and new customers set up accounts.
Most of the people in front of me, as I learned from Starr, my "licensed personal banker," came for the same reason as me.
But compared to me, they have already chosen their savings from smaller banks in places they came from, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania or Staten Island.
They chose money from so-called thrifts (a bit similar to construction savings), monetary unions and those types of savings whose branches operate in only one state, and who claim to care for their customers as a family.
Over the past year, 15 such banks have collapsed silently.
A few days ago, Washington Mutual, a bank with assets worth <0x24>327 billion, went into bankruptcy, and when New Yorkers returned home on Friday evening, another bank, Wachovia, with assets worth <0x24>440 billion, tried to catch a rescue buyer.
Employees of offices and shops who stood in front of me and were afraid of another collapse, moved their cash to a bank that is perceived as a safe harbour and that does most of the rescue on Wall Street.
The ordinary New Yorkers have learned financially fluently over the past week.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket spoke on the phone and spoke to Lehman Borthers, that bank that collapsed, and her exhausted chief executive, Dick Fulda, with such familiarity as a rollercoaster.
And Lyn, a uniform about 50-year-old housewife of my agent, changed the topic of our usual conversation - Brad, Angelina, or my food delivery.
After my visit to the bank, she told me, "I now have my savings in the money market funds.
I've moved it, I'm not going to risk it."
Muslim tombs unveiled after Austrian right-wing fracture
Heinz-Christian Strache, on the left, from the Austrian Free Party and Filip Dewinter from the Belgian Right, Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration, which presented the organization "Cities Against Islamization" in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They are similar to traffic signs that show mosques crossed by a red line.
Police accuse right-wing extremists of defaming a Muslim cemetery in Austria on the same weekend, when the far-right parties made huge profits in the general election.
More than 90 tombs at the cemetery in the town of Traun near Linz were sometimes severely damaged between Friday evening and this morning, and the police are convinced that it was an organized event.
The culprits sprayed Jewish symbols on some graves such as the David Star, but the detectives are convinced it could be an attempt to mask the motives of extremists led by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident was somehow linked to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they are "deeply shocked" by the news of the unveiling that comes as the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan approaches.
In the meantime, Austria is entering the wheel of searching for its own soul after the right-wing has slipped in yesterday’s parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties, which combined more than 30 percent of the vote, the Free Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, led a vehement anti-immigration campaign, and some of their slogans were criticized as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the chairman of the Free Party, who won over 18 percent of the vote, protested against the Shats and the Burqas in the campaign, and even expressed his opposition to food that is perceived to be related to Islam.
At his last meeting with voters in Vienna, he spoke of a “European brotherhood” to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both sides are trying to ban the construction of mosques and minarets and argue that they are political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the election, which put the far right in the position of the country’s strongest political bloc, suggest that this change was caused primarily by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is not allowed to travel abroad.
Gary Glitter, a glamour rock star who was convicted of child sexual abuse, was banned from travelling to France and Spain.
Officials have imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the surveillance authorities that he plans to travel across France to Spain.
Kent police agreed to a travel ban on Thursday after it handed over evidence of Glitter’s previous convictions for child sexual abuse to officials.
Glitter, in his own name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford Lowest Criminal Court in Kent, but was represented by lawyers from Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the judiciary said: "On Thursday, September 25, at Ashford's lowest criminal court, the Kenyan police requested a decree that would prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from crossing the borders to France and Spain until March 25.
Paul Gadd did not participate personally.
The 64-year-old Glitter informed the authorities that he wanted to travel to a foreign country, as it records him in the registry of sex offenders.
He must notify the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
They also have to pass the scheduled departure date to the police a week in advance.
If the obligation to inform the authorities failed, he could be sentenced to five years.
Kent police have announced that they will not discuss individual cases of possible Glitter roads across the district.
A Kent police spokeswoman said: “Kent police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our point of view, it is easier to monitor someone who will stay in Britain, because we have extensive systems here that manage potential hazards more effectively.
Protecting the population of Kent is a top priority for the Kentucky police, and we are working closely to monitor the behavior of registered sexual assaulters in order to minimize any threats to the public."
Glitter returned to Britain last month after spending 27 months in Vietnamese prison for abuse of two girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he was supposed to take a flight to London.
But he said he wasn't feeling well, and he refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not allow him to pass a passport check and eventually flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted on his return to Britain.
On August 22, he finally arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 and remained there, while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge Lowest Criminal Court in West London and at the same time successfully requested Scotland Yard a warrant that he had to register as a fugitive.
Glitter was previously imprisoned in the UK for four months for possession of child pornography.
A source from the Interior Ministry said that Jacqui Smith, the Interior Minister, is calm and happy that Glitter was prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
"To capture the true character, I photograph the master outside the scene." - Günther Bauer - photographer
No underwear, no rings, no costumes.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, distracted from focusing on interpretation, is the only way to achieve the relaxed expression of a man or a woman.
On the one hand, an artist.
Secondly, man.
Indistinguishable, if we ignore privacy, in those moments far from the audience - then you can see a confidential gesture, the depth of the glance captured, or the passionate gesture of the hands, which are carefree, because they do not want to come out on stage.
German Günther Bauer replaces in "Flamenco-people" theatrical performances with singers, dancers and guitarists with the lesser-known faces of the masters.
For this purpose, the photographer compiles a unique iconography of flamenco from different environments.
The exhibition, which takes place under the program Mes de la Fotografía Flamenca (Mes de la Fotografía Flamenca), "reflects the ever-growing international significance of flamenco", says the author and explains that "Flamenco-people" "can be any kind of people, but when you look at them, you look at them, you look at the photograph.
These people portrayed "on the street" are artists capable of conveying passion, sadness, joy... and fully captivating the audience.
To capture the personality of these artists, it is not necessary to photograph on stage.
She carries her personality and character inside.
I was interested in creating a relaxed atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of the Flamenco giants.
Enchanted by the festival "Cante de las Minas", Bauer embarked on a long journey of portraits of flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers on a desktop camera in 1997.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of the camera and the material, resemble classic photography.
The use of different stylistical means is contrary to the classical basis of the picture and lends it a contemporary spirit, which is an idea that, according to Bauer himself, also reflects flamenco: "Music with very traditional roots, which does not cease to surprise and evolve."
What shatters the audience is not the action of the dance itself, the singing or the play, but the personality and character of the artist.
The search for the moment when we encounter the most essential, the spirit that appears in the way of perception, being and experience, that was and is the constant work presented during these days in the gallery El Fotómata.
This selection of nearly seventy photographed artists is made up of famous flamenco figures such as Diego El Cigal, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales and Vicente Amigo.
The project became a sort of an anthology of flamenco and soon a book edition will be available, which will contain the portraits exhibited.
Two years ago, the passion for portraiting brought Bauer to the idea of repeating the "Portraits of a Sports Veteran" ("SportARTproject").
Although their concept is different from "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "photographing people, getting to know them and having the opportunity for a moment, whether longer or short, to enter their lives - this is my passion.
I think the portrait in the photo is the most difficult genre.
A person meets or clashes with people, personalities he sometimes doesn’t even know, or gives him a few minutes to take a photo.
Despite similar circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my imaginations.”
A collection of portraits of contemporary flamenco entitled "Flamenco-people" is exhibited in the Galleria El Fotómata on the street de la Mata 20, parallel to Alameda de Hércules, and can be visited until October 16.
Vargas Llosa admits that the novel he writes is "trustee"
Set in an environment he doesn’t know yet, Mario Vargas Llosa intends to successfully implement his new project – he’s working on a novel whose main character is Amazon, an Irish nationalist who lived in the Congo in the twenties.
An eternal Nobel Prize laureate at the Hay Festival Segovia yesterday admitted that the project he is currently employing is "truthful" and that "everything proves I shouldn't write" this novel.
"If I had reason, I wouldn't have done it, but I'll do it, and I believe I'll finish it one day," he concluded his contribution to the exchange of ideas, ideas and words, which he saw in the city in four days an aqueduct around hundreds of other writers, novelists and historians.
The author of the novel "City and Dogs" was one of the main characters of the third year of the celebration of words and fulfilled expectations.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award for the most popular writer – the old edition of Dickens’ “Our mutual friend” – filled the Juan Bravo theater to the last place.
With Felix Rome, who referred to him, he had a devoted audience in front of him, a pyramid, to which the hour of time had run like water - the Peruvian, with amazing precision and a noteworthy amount of humour, recalled how in him he had been borne from the original "unbelievable adventure"; he had a "peace" about what, a "peace" from the "pleasant" of his passionate reader.
The Hispano-American novelist admitted that "there is no way" to find out whether and to what extent books can change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is just a fun, a fleeting experience" - stressed Vargas Llosa's "seriousness" with his "seriousness" and his "spirit" and "seriousness to the people" according to him.
Climatology loses festival in Pozoblanco - missing copies
The performance with the copies, which closes the ceremony in Pozoblanco, was cancelled yesterday morning after the announcement was confirmed that the surface of the square is not in good condition.
The company, together with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to cancel the bullfight.
Unfavourable weather conditions have deteriorated this celebration for a long time, two out of three celebrations could no longer take place.
On Saturday, the rain prevented the course of the second planned bull games.
During the formations of José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista were to build bulls in the arena in Castilblanca.
This is how it was celebrated on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who cut three ears, and the reward for a dynamic and aesthetically high-quality performance was brought to his shoulder.
On the same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante exchanged two wounds for a salute and one ear, which brought him more uncovered seats in the arena than toreador art.
Worse still was El Juli, who went through the bull’s arena Los Llanos unprepared fatty.
In the second round of the work without a single breath, he deserved sharp criticism from the majority of the audience.
Taken control in <0xC3><0x81>lava in a truck with two thousand kilograms of ham
In ten minutes, five.
Road control Ertzaintza in the municipal district of Armin<0xC3><0xB2>n (<0xC3><0x81>lava).
The officers stop two people going to the van and they're going to the van.
The cargo, more than two tons of hammer, is not to be stopped.
According to a report by the Internal Committee of the Basque Government, they were persecuted and detained by members of the public, a 38-year-old man who was identified as A.A.J.
The detainee was accused of drug smuggling and falsifying state documents.
The incident occurred when several members of the Transportation Unit carried out road checks on the N-1 in places where it crosses the boundary of the Armin<0xC3><0xB2>n city district.
They were about to stop the van for inspection, but the driver did not obey the instructions, sharply accelerated and caught.
The car owners immediately began to prosecute when the vehicle stopped at the edge a few kilometers away, at which point the two passengers jumped out and fled into the forested grove.
The Ertzaintza members eventually seized one of them and confiscated 2,178 kilograms of hashish, which the suspects were transporting, as it appeared during an inspection of the Iveco Daily truck.
The rear of the vehicle was loaded with packets of hashish, which were subsequently transferred to other police departments for detailed expertise and drug weighing.
In addition, the police found that the identification mark was "fake" and did not agree with the information contained in the delivery documents, he was therefore also charged with falsifying state documents.
Ertzaintza continues to search for a second suspect, who, as has already been mentioned, managed to escape to finally determine the origin of the drug seized.
Detained A.A.J., 28, was transferred to the police department to deal with the necessary formalities before joining a further investigation.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for drug-induced driving
Actress Heather Locklear, Amanda from Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California for drug-induced driving.
The Witness saw her perform unusual maneuvers as she tried to get out of the parking lot in Montecito, a spokesman for the California Road Guard told People magazine.
The Witness explained that at about 4:30 p.m., Locklear "shouldered the gas, for noisy drilling, she walked forward and back and tried to get out of the parking lot - she switched sunglasses several times when she was lying down."
The Witness, who didn’t seem to know the actress at first, saw Locklear just a moment after she stopped on a nearby highway and got out of the vehicle.
The person also alerted the rescue service because she was "afraid of Locklear's life".
When the police patrol arrived, she found an actress inside the vehicle, which partially blocked the roadmap.
“She looked disoriented,” and therefore her relatives took her to a specialized drug and alcohol center to undergo a test.
According to a police spokeswoman, the actress cooperated and excessive alcohol was suddenly excluded, yet "we believe Locklear was under the influence of some drugs, which was visible to the officers at first glance."
Locklear was detained on suspicion of driving under the influence of the effects of the nearest unspecified substance and was taken into custody around 7 p.m., although several hours later she was released.
Two months ago, Locklear returned from a medical clinic where she recovered from anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges Andalusian association IU to exercise its powers in the Silva case
IU chief general and United Left MP Gaspar Llamazares today announced that the final decision in the case of the former Youth and Sports Council of the City Hall of Seville, Francisca Manuel Silvy, who resigned from his office last week after being charged with party charges.
"I'm too federalist for it, it's up to the Andalusian organization to exercise its powers," Llamazares said at a meeting that the party will have to proceed with in relation to a former member of the Seville City Council.
The head of the IU, however, insisted that in the case of an investigation into the illegal activity that Silva admitted to, "transparency" is absolutely necessary: "the IU has always fought for such matters to be as transparent as possible."
He also stressed that the party has a "strict code of ethics for all public functions".
"The Blood of May" ("Sangre de Mayo"), Garci's epic bet
José Luis Garci in the film "The Blood of May" (Sangre de Mayo), to which he was inspired by Episodes from the national past of Benito Pérez Galdós, revives the famous Spanish uprising against the French - it is the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of 15 mills.
In this way, the filmmaker wanted to "draw the expressiveness of the characters and the analysis of society", which he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, explained today together with Quim Gutiérrez and Paulo Echevarría during the presentation of the picture before a large team of interpreters.
The May Blood, with a footage of more than two and a half hours, will be shown in cinemas this Friday, and in the future will be more than four-hour TV series for Telemadrid.
As a great admirer of the literary work of Galdós José Luis Garci, he claims that by filming this film he fulfilled his "children's dream", which is due to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago to film the image for the Autonomous Province of Madrid.
The budget of 15 million, to which the province of Madrid has contributed completely, means for Garci a "uniform opportunity" to create an environment with scenes and costumes corresponding to the image of "scary Spain," which was mistaken in the leader, and who was not the only one who fought for.
However, the director regrets that he could not count on the financial support that was given to the films Sad Wing (Ala sad) or Goy's ghosts - almost twice the amount of May's blood -, so he could not film some scenes from the script signed at the same time, with the film by Horace Valcárce.
The director of the film "Recount" (Volver and start) works as usual - on stage with actors who he usually tries before filming and who he doesn't pick with casting, because he thinks it's "humiliating" and also thinks it's a bit of a bitch, and he thinks it's a bit of a bitch, and he's a bit of a bitchy.
Many of the actors he chose for May's Blood appear before his camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Gullén Cuervo.
Garci with four Oscar nominations, one of which he won, is of the opinion that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year in front of the Hollywood Academy, the May Blood itself, the Seven Tables of the French Billiards, and the last selected film, "she's a badass, but she's an obscene, obscene."
For this film Garci does not expect any awards.
“At first, you think you’re working for what’s going to happen, but then you realize you’re only working for a profit, so you’ll be allowed to make one more movie,” Garci explains with more than 30 years of directorial career.
Isabel Bayón revives the spiritual reference of Sevillan dancer Tortolas Valencia
Seville's flamenco dancer gives up the hold of another Seville dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, from the father of Catalonia (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and the mother of Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in Triana, and when she was three, she moved with her family to London.
She danced modern dance and focused on oriental dance.
She lived a passionate life, pioneering female emancipation such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and fought for the abolition of the cursive, which made it impossible for women to move freely.
The life of this woman influenced by the dance and aesthetic revolution of interwar Europe was enchanted by Isabel Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pep Gamboa and she suggested this character to me - it seemed unbelievable to me."
According to the dancer, "I'm not talking about her life, but about grabbing the soul.
The names of her dance performances reminded me of the rhythms of flamenco.
So the butterfly dance evoked a guajira or the snake dance of some tanga.
Her dance was meaningful and they told me that my dance of this aesthetic also fits,” she says.
The performance counts on the involvement of two exceptional personalities: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing Isabelle in one performance as well as in "La puerta abierta" (La puerta abierta), and with dance teacher Matilde Coral, who made the exception and made her appearance.
"Matilde represents the older Tortola, a mature figure.
I’m happy that she accepted the offer to participate in my project, and it’s a great honor for me.”
The performance also features the music and guitars of Jesús Torres and Paca Arriagy, with the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulgy and Moi de Morón; the drums El Pájara, the violin of Rafa El Violy and the collaboration of actor Juanfry Juárez, "who have the role of primal guides, who are the leaders of this kind.
The work also takes into account the life of this woman, who played for her time in such distant places as India, the United States or Russia, as well as throughout Europe, as she usually lived in London.
“I wanted to remind her, because I think she was one of those women who had a huge influence at some point, but no one knows her today and then less appreciates her creation,” Bayón says.
The show starts today at 20.30 at the Lope de Vegy Theatre.
The book "Diary of a Freshly Married" also closes the triennials
Introduction of the first illustrated edition of the "Diary of the Freshly Married" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Cenobi in March 1916, is part of the program coordinated by the Cultural Council of the Death of Nostradamus (Nostradamus) and the 2008 "Journal of the Autonomous Andalus Government" by the "Zelina" (Zelina)
"The Zenobie and Juan Ramón series" is about to end with a new edition of this work, an international congress to be held in New York, the Nobel Museum House repair, and a travel exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez's Provence: The Day of the Sun Becomes a New Year's Eve," which was covered in the past.
The Cultural Council of the Autonomous Government of Andalusia also ordered eight hundred copies of the "Diary of a Freshly Married" edited by Pedr Taberner and illustrated by Jacob Pérez-Encis to continue to spread awareness of the personality and work of one of the most sacred Andalusian poets.
America doesn't like Paul Newman so much anymore.
“Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them.
These are the words of actress Sally Field, who collaborated with him on "Without Evil Intentions" and under the heavy awareness that Newman left, reveals her uncomfortable vision of abandoned American cinema and the whole of America.
Look how long it took them to get an Oscar.
He has been retired since 2007.
And he knew he was seriously ill.
Yet he was a boy for all.
"Sometimes what a person feels can't be expressed in any way, and I have now lost a great friend," said Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better because of him."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
The father of the film and the country died in a particularly dark time of fear of terrorists and financial markets, at a time when American self-confidence is at the bottom of a desperate search for reasons to be proud.
When time is rough and people without virtues and only a handful of those who are worth admiring you – there is no need to be Luis Cernud to love Paul Newman.
For all, he embodied the almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and a fighter for lost and won cases, from the Anti-Drug Addiction Foundation based on the honor of the firstborn son who died of overdose to his own brand of homemade food and biofood.
A complete treasure for a country that has taken a lot of effort to say goodbye to a suicidal food culture.
A stormy wave of admiration flooded Hollywood regardless of nationality or nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, found that not one man died, but an entire era.
Another Englishman, an Oscar holder directed by Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was without effort the culmination of his career.
The bad guy from Australia, Russell Crowe, has tried to call Newman his greatest source of inspiration.
"That fox has put a pretty high heel on us all," says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today has the courage to try to live as Paul Newman lived - based on honesty and lead a serious private life away from cameras.
It’s not always easy, sometimes even possible, in today’s media jungle.
But fortunately, such people are, and Paul Newman is their model.
He divorced once, and since then he has been married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, who was faithful, although the insurer had more than enough opportunities to be absent.
"Why would I go out for a hamburger when I have filet at home?" he jokes.
May his pride in heaven be accompanied by the convictions between his daughters and admirers on earth – this is not all too common in America.
It is said that "of all the great roles he embodied, he was the most ardent in the role of a devoted husband, a loving father, a willing grandfather, and a sacrificial philanthropist."
Category: Imperfect races at the Madrid Olympics
Yes, many of us want the Olympics to be held in Madrid, and after the unsuccessful 2012 it will be possible in 2016.
But I ask myself, are we ready?
If we're going to run the race yesterday, I'm going to say no!
It was spoken of as the perfect race, and in my opinion it was the worst I've ever been at.
Such a dream of nonsense, that as soon as there was an evaluation and I was testing, it would be clearly insufficient.
But let’s look at it from the beginning, pretty much one after another.
The nonsense starts with picking up the race number, because of which one has to leave early.
That doesn’t seem bad to me, but when a person goes there, let them give him everything (including a chip to prevent overloading the track).
Oh, no.
Here the man had to pick up the number first (first nonsense, go there just because of it) and (after the appearance of the proper front) - what a surprise! - they only had a T-shirt size S (second nonsense, because I need size XL).
Where do we live?
This is because of the crisis they decided to buy only small t-shirts, because it is less fabric and are cheaper?
All right, that's a little bit compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to the fact that he had to go very early for the chip and the front lasted over 15 minutes, the backpack had to be delivered there.
Over 35 minutes of waiting time, which is at a race where 11,000 people are expected, something incomprehensible.
So, as expected, the race started and we haven’t put our backpacks down yet, and when it’s done, it was much worse with the pickup.
The wait was further extended by 40 minutes of rain, which led to a general uprising and attack on the cabin.
I believe that 500 of us will have pneumonia tomorrow, and some, like me, won’t show up the right time in the evaluation of the results because of the chip they gave me and which, I suppose, didn’t record the start time correctly.
Of course, if someone asked me about a perfect race, this one wouldn't hit me.
So I think we're just going to have to pretend about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT Conference on New Technologies, Microsoft unveiled further developments in the new image recognition and human interaction system in the way of artificial intelligence – not too intelligent, but able to perform basic tasks such as calling a taxi (or, in the case of Microsoft, a message that would move with what, in the entire area of the company).
Thanks to a camera and a system that recognizes shapes and faces, this “receptionist” can find out how many people are in the room, who they are – even remember what they are wearing – and listen and understand the keywords of their conversations.
It can also sort the present by conversation groups.
In the demonstration video, the receptionist records a third person and understands that he is not a member of the group talking to her and that he is not an employee of the company.
She asks if she's going after someone, and she tells her that she'll be taking care of her in a moment.
All without the blue screen of death.
Awesome.
But of course, this is the music of the future.
Now the company has more important things to do, such as a new version of the Windows operating system.
There has been a lot of talk this week about changing Microsoft’s strategy.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer came to the conclusion that if computers had only the most necessary, without the burden of commercial unnecessary, they would be five times more powerful — man, Steve, they would be cheaper.
A discovery like a game when we consider that Microsoft version from the version adds new features to Windows and more "extra".
A change of direction would be a meritorious act.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is slowly losing its relevance and similarly software is on it.
When Google Chrome appeared on the network, I became one of those who tended to the theory that it was Google’s first step towards competing with Windows.
Many have rightly pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the necessary layer to understand between hardware and software.
It has the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to the chin.
That's true.
It never disappears, but it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system not as absolute truth, but as relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People are increasingly paying less attention to the operating system and, conversely, more and more internet browsers.
The computer turns on to start Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and we spend more time on the Internet every day than around the windows.
What is the use of half of the apps that accompany the system?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is now interested in offering its services online and finally becoming an alternative to Google.
They need it, and I have a little example.
This photo I took in a rest room for Microsoft employees in Redmond at the beginning of the month.
There was a poster on the drink machine asking them to use their search tools: "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study showed that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the internet.
Last week, the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed.
It will not come at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, so let’s count to 2010.
Microsoft will definitely try to market Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The phone is becoming more and more a computer.
Since Android and iPhone are already on the market, they will have to pay for the delay.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the Azur Coast, Leonardo di Caprio in one glowed in Edward Zwick's "Blood Diamond", as well as Al Pacino in the "Motor" Francis Ford Coppola, and is also part of the uniform of the muscular gay community.
And if we want to dive into the reading of his life roles, we can dive into the image of a typical muscle with a tip of the cheek, which lifts the feathers in the cat circus.
Basically, it’s nothing more than a typical cotton men’s undershirt, fit and without sleeves.
English speakers call him 'tank', but le Fabuleux Marcel from Brussels excels above all others.
First of all, for his nickname - although popularly called 'Marcel' - which has to do with sport, because, according to legend, it was named after boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of singer Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' stands out over other high-quality cotton, unisex cut, distinctive label and (almost unrecognizable) Belgian flag, with models of the most emblematic t-shirts as a detail at the neck.
And beware, because the Belgian company does not specialize in tank tops only.
It also produces college shirts, retro boxers, cashmere sweaters, cotton trousers, navy shirts, children's clothing, mini shorts...
Designed pieces for comfortable underwear.
It's a shame that they're just underwear.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mother. Who will be a father, I don't care."
The enormous image of her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz, but little characters, is a woman full of life.
Their new fashion activities are now being taken very seriously by the Cruz sisters.
For Monica, it means so much more than just that some pretty, famous girls will lend their name.
In Paris, she participated in a promotional event organized by Mango at its new headquarters, as well as the announcement of the most significant fashion awards sponsored by the Spanish company.
She's hearty and daring and she'll get you close.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present a new collection that Sister Penélope and I have proposed for Mango for this autumn-winter season, and at the same time I participated in the announcement of the second year of the "Mango Fashion Awards" and dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentina.
It was a difficult but exciting day at the same time.
What is your new collection for Mango, for which you are already working for the fourth season?
My sister and I love movies from the 50s and 60s, and we’ve gotten a lot of inspiration from them.
I also really like to walk around the city and watch women walk dressed, how they combine and value their clothes, I do it very often.
You're a dancer, an actress, a designer, so you're a very versatile woman, right?
I think so, but in the end everything is connected and has a lot of connections.
I may have been distracted by the clothes, I always wanted to go to Grandma's, talk in my aunt's closets, and look at her clothes.
It was a sensation, almost better than going on a hike.
When I became a dancer, I always tried to take care of how I was dressed.
You know, we dancers rely on how we're adjusted to feel good in our classes and exams when looking in the mirror.
And as an actress, when they give you a costume, you really get into the character.
So everything is connected, however, with great respect for designers and professionalism.
Recently you were 30, you had a crisis?
Kdepak.
I'm feeling better than ever before, I'm having fun with 30.
I find that a woman is already ready, has experience and life enjoys it with fewer mistakes.
Biological clocks don't scare me.
I refuse to do what I want, and it gives me great inner happiness.
So you're thinking about being a mother, aren't you?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother, because my body is asking for it, and besides, I want to be a young mother, I don't want to spoil it.
As for my father, I'm not worried about it.
But one thing I know for sure is that I will give my child a sense of happiness and I will raise him with great love.
As for the movie, there are a few premieres waiting for you that you made last year.
It’s so, and I’m looking forward to seeing them in the movies.
I'm from the theater world, so I'm very impatient and restless, I want everything right now and of course it's not possible.
I am looking forward to the premiere of "La última hora" and "En busca de la tumba de Cristo".
Apparently, how you'll like it...
A few days ago, you had your premiere at the tour mole next to Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I'm going to climb the mud as a model.
I was just called by Naomi Campbell, whom I knew for a long time, and invited me to London to participate in the charity tours for her organization "Women for a Better Life" and the clothes we presented - I also picked two models from our collection - I would not have organised the front of the collection for the Mango - and the outfit.
People don't know Naomi has such a good heart.
There are a lot of things about her, and I know her, so I can tell you that many of them are not true.
Besides, I'll stick to the good he's engaged in.
She asked me to perform for charitable purposes, but if she asked me to make a stick, I'll do it too.
For the sake of the women of the Third World, I will do what is necessary.
Drivers who are repeatedly ingested with alcohol in their blood will have to install an "alcolock"
The Ministry of the Interior is demanding that a driver with three administrative penalties for driving under the influence of alcohol must install a system in his car that prevents him from booting in drunkenness or if he is unable to breathe.
The proposal was announced in June of this year and is now included in the annual report of the Supreme State Prosecutor’s Office, according to which it is a one-year pilot project.
Its goal is to return the driver to the steering wheel, so drivers will also have to complete a transport retraining course.
In addition to the National Transportation Safety Authority, the Directorate-General of Transportation (DGT) and the Foundation of the Institute of Technology for Car Safety (FITSA) will participate in this experience.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75% of drivers accused of driving drunk more than once again in this condition sit behind the wheel.
Alcolock should prevent this, as it is a system connected to a vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in the exhaled air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not breathe before or if the alcohol concentration is recorded above the permissible level.
Its price exceeds <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,000 and it should be paid by the culprit himself.
A study carried out in this regard in the United States in 2007 showed that within the first year since its introduction, the infringements were reduced by 65%.
In Spain, it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people every year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: that this behavior be resolved before committing a criminal offence.
And in order to facilitate its introduction, since the regulation can be carried out in the usual manner, the necessary modification of the criminal provisions, however, requires a change of the law.
The device is not yet available in any sales version on the Spanish market, even though some industrial vehicles and public service vehicles have already been tested installed.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of MEPs will vote on the PSOE (Spanish Labour Socialist Party) proposal, which recommends installing this system in school buses, as is the case in France.
In Mexico and without "peeptoes"
With British precision, at 5:40 p.m., as it stood in the program, a Spanish air force plane landed in the presidential hangar at Benita Juárez Airport in Mexico City, D. F., where the Prince and Princess of Asturias arrived.
The sun had just set, but its rays had yet to close their eyes so that the successor pair could be seen coming out of the plane.
Under the stairs stood the Spanish ambassador and other officials.
A few hours ago, I asked the taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish prince and the princess were coming for a state visit.
- Yeah, that's great, it won't be allowed to get to the airport to pick up people... she's out of here or what...
- No, no, sir, she's a Spaniard, but she lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, that's right...
The Mexican press, however, knows who the Prince and Princess of Asturias are and how important their visit is.
Many people are waiting in the hangar at the airport near the red carpet and the military cordon, which consists of 27 naval soldiers ready to fire an honorary ointment.
The prince appears with a smile on his lips in a dark blue suit, and the princess, very slenderly dressed and with her hair loose, does not have her usual "peeptoes", apparently reported that there was a storm in D.F.
Before they go to the hall, where the official delegation awaits, they smile at the photographers and don’t force them to submit.
At the door of the hotel, where they will be staying, one of the city’s four largest, a well-reported Mexican television reporter awaits them.
Best Featured Fashion Prices
There’s probably no better place in the world to announce a fashion award than Paris, and there’s probably no more prominent designer and animated than Valentino.
Mango has just announced the second year of the El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards to enable an international presentation of new fashion talents.
The price is supported by <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300,000.
The Belgian Sandrina Fasoli, the winner of the first year, looked at her proposals yesterday at the exhibition Manga on the 54th Haussmann Boulevard in Paris and almost wept with admiration.
Sure, it is the company’s second largest store in Europe and has just opened on an area of 1,335 square meters.
The largest one is located in London.
Many events, together with the desire to thank the designers Valentino for taking the presidency of the Competition Jury, caused us to finally have an overcrowded dinner at the Garnier Opera House in Paris.
Mango’s festively decorated presidential desk looked even more amazing next to Chagall’s most famous works.
Nati, who, with heartbroken grief over her brother's recent death, did not reveal anything, dressed herself in the dress of this brand and the ELAH jewelry over which she was hiding her breath, and hung up in her son Luise - almost two meters of elegance - accompanied Valentine's table in the cathedral.
Andik, the chief and owner of Mango, was welcomed and, as a true gentleman, remained with Baron Rothschild without a suit, as they were both offered to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who arrived at the shop in - hand-designed - pants and shirts, and for dinner dressed in long black sexy dresses, went on a night walk to the Opera with Goya Toled's accompaniment, showed us the "salle d'été" and the "salle d'été d'été" for the ballet.
Inés Sastre did not stop for a tour of the adjacent buildings of the palace, but before leaving showed us photos of her son on a mobile phone.
The next morning we were able to love the presence of Olivier Martínez - another young man riding a motorcycle - and John Travolty, who came to the Intercontinental in Paris with his own linens and towels and requested that no perfume be used in his rooms in advance.
The stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh there, that's life.
1001 - Counter-Strike Number
Not 1000, but 1000 plus one way to forget the chaotic and angry everyday life.
And not to mention that, they are all summarized in one book, which on September 30 will bring to the bookstore relax.
The alarm rings every morning at 7 a.m. as a punishment, but it’s even worse to imagine yourself absorbed in a rushing rhythm that brings contemporary life.
The office is called the voltage and the computer the back pain.
Stress is a disease of the 21st century.
However, there are neither one nor two methods to combat everyday exhaustion and the problems of disconnecting from the world of work.
No, that number is not much bigger and much less than 1001.
Susannah Marriott's out of yoga position, classic massages and "spa" therapy on the pages of her book has collected a whole "menu" of options, adjusted to each individual's taste and time options.
The anti-stress book is called "1001 Way of Relaxation" and thanks to the publishing house of Pearson Alhambra and DK, it will bring peace to the bookstore.
If someone feels that it is not possible to achieve peace in areas such as work or personal relationships, the “handbook” denies this view.
In addition, it offers additional procedures to be in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline is no longer in your veins, which restores balance in your body, and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, turn off and focus on reading.
Speech from sleep
Some kids talk at night.
I don’t mean those who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the kids who talk while they’re asleep.
When it happens for the first time, it may cure you, but in fact, it is insignificant.
This is an innocuous sleep disorder called somniloquy.
It is very common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure some of you were told he was talking from sleep at night.
This phenomenon can occur very rarely (e.g. once in a lifetime with high fevers), or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once every several months...), the second day the child does not remember anything.
There is no single reason to explain its origins.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders such as nightmares, nightmares, nightmares, enuresis (night care) or obesity, but it may not be the case.
As mentioned earlier, it can often be accompanied by very high fever, stressful or stressful situations.
In any case, this is a rare phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also different.
The child can speak in a calm voice, say individual words, whisper, or vice versa (screaming, crying, long speeches...).
In cases where it manifests itself with great force, it would be advisable to observe the child and consult with a specialist to find out if he has any problem that causes great anxiety in him and in this way manifests itself.
We said it is a harmless disorder, so it is not treated only if it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with apnea syndrome or permanent stress).
However, we can do this by having a few very simple preventative measures in mind, such as:
Try not to bother your child too much before going to bed.
So look for calm games and avoid frightening or somewhat violent TV shows or series.
In very nervous children and those who can relax at work, it is possible to use relaxation techniques that will help them gain a certain inner calm.
This will allow the child to sleep more calmly.
When a somnilocybe appears, try to keep calm.
Remember that it is harmless to the child and that from what happened the next day he will remember nothing.
Useful Advice
Don't be him.
It's unnecessary because he's not conscious and you're interrupting his sleep.
Even though he talks, he sleeps, so he rests.
Remember that if you think several times in a row that you are very concerned, it would be advisable to seek advice or find out what causes such anxiety in your child.
If you understand what he is saying (which is not so common), avoid the temptation to interrogate him and draw information from him.
It's no use, because when he's asleep, he's not aware of how to arrange his thoughts.
In addition, you can hear what he says, but you don’t know what he thinks about it, and why he says it, so pay close attention to how you interpret the information and what conclusions you come up with.
Never tell your child that you can ask him about his secrets at night.
It's not funny.
That's causing a lot of anxiety.
Don’t worry, it’s nothing wrong, it’s just an episode that only takes a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern finally found his way back to victory after a long slim period.
Without playing a particularly big game, the yellows created more chances and were able to change one of them victoriously.
The game did not have a very fast pace during this clash, in which the attackers were hard-pressed.
After the captain's first attempt, Kauffmann's host, who had just passed the ally with a firing from a distance, began to have Illhaeusern slightly up and first Fonderflick from a distance, then Hirne by air, Romain on a long leg or even Diebold gradually came to annoy Dan.
The opponent, on the other hand, built a defensive wave in the middle of the field and left only Agile Riahi on the top of the attack.
The start of the second half turned out to be decisive, firstly thanks to the two chances of Dannemarie named Riahi and Temporale, then after opening the score for Illhaeusern, which was taken care of by Marais, well located for the processing of the ball reflected after the previous Diebol 53.
Gólman Illhaeuserna, however, did not enjoy the joy for a long time; after about twelve minutes he was forced to return to the dressing room, leaving his fellow players weakened.
Dannemarie, however, was unable to take advantage of it and the eleventh of Illhaeusern, which only a little retreated to "slow down" the defense, no longer caused any major problems, except for the last seconds of the match, when the ball, after the great confusion b, flew over.
Sarkozy goes to the angry fishermen.
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a trip through Britain.
To face a demonstration of fishing power that severely disrupted access to several British and Norman ports on Monday, the French president decided to head to the port of Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet with their representatives there.
The latter promised to be accepted "in a constructive spirit" and hoped to "come up with concrete proposals".
The presidential visit comes at the same time as the general meeting of the "crisis committee" set up by British fishermen in order to get measures against a sharp rise in oil prices, which reached a peak of more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.14 per litre on average.
According to Elysees Palace spokesman David Martinon, "the president will talk to them about solutions that can be imagined in an effort to help their companies regain competitiveness and better secure the conditions for the employment and payment of seafarers."
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to be a fisherman with inevitability.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out a "slow-driving" operation in the Morbihan and Calvados departments, causing an almost 10km constipation.
The holiday harbour in Quiberon was also blocked, but connections to Belle-<0xC3><0x8E>le were not interrupted.
On the Quiberon Peninsula, a filtration debris was carried out.
The sailors demonstrated their determination on Monday, as they burned tyres and pallets in front of the fuel warehouses of ports in Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement expanded to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the Canal de la Manche, such as Sables d'Olonne in Vendée, where trawlers remained in the port, or to Le Havre, where about twenty ships blocked commercial ships.
During the evening, fishermen from Turballe and Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique region stopped the blockade of the important Total refinery in Donges.
The people of Boulogne-sur-Mer have decided to wait until they decide to act on their own, until Wednesday’s meeting at the ministry.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" is due to decide on how to proceed on the road ahead and on its participation in the prepared meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris on Tuesday.
However, some British fishermen do not want to be represented by the heads of the State Fisheries Department who did not support their movement.
"The stop will continue" because "fishers won't stop at anything" and "don't want to go to Paris," for example, said Liliane Cariou, chairman of the fisheries department in Lorient.
Fishermen who do not pay the oil tax are currently paying around 50 cents per litre, but believe that the ship’s yield threshold is reached only when the oil is below 0.30 euros per litre.
Paul Newman 's
The unforgettable "Butche Cassidy and Kid" actor died of cancer at his home in Connecticut at the age of 83.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, or Sam Mendes revered the film legend and politically engaged actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its supply assumptions for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer relies on the supply of 215 aircraft this year, despite the threat of a recession that surrounds the world economy.
The world’s fourth-largest aircraft designer, Embraer, maintains its prerequisites for 2008 deliveries with 215 delivered devices, its president Fredrico Fleury Curado confirmed.
In the first half of the year, the manufacturer added 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian designer promises a lot from the Chinese market, especially with a range of aircraft from 30 to 120 seats at a glance.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 appliances to Chinese customers over the course of eight years.
AIG says it is considering transferring 15% of its assets
Insurer American International Group, who has been given over water by U.S. money authorities, is considering transferring more than 15% of its assets to pay off the <0x24>85 billion he was given as a deposit, the Financial Times reported on Sunday.
AIG is ready to investigate the sale of most of its non-life insurance activities in the international field and retirement activities in the United States, a diary citing sources close to the ongoing negotiations.
According to FT, the AIG Board of Directors met on Sunday evening to investigate any transfers.
It was not possible to obtain any affirmative statements from AIG.
The assets that AIG intends to dispose of include its subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in insurance company Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate and private equity investment portfolio.
No final decision on these transfers has yet been taken, FT continues.
AIG must quickly get cash to pay off the <0x24>85 billion loan from the Federal Reserve with the risk that the U.S. authorities will seize it 80% of its capital, while at the same time diluting it to the appropriate ratio of its current shareholder.
Paris. Analysis of the historic session of the Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange recorded a historic decline on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson's plan to save banks: Dow Jones lost 6.98 percent, an unprecedented loss of nearly 800 points, and Nasdaq 9.14 percent.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell from 777.68 points to 10 365.45 points.
The biggest point decline in its history (by 684.81 points) occurred on September 17, 2001, the day of the renewal of trade after the terrorist attacks of September 11.
The Nasdaq Index with the dominant technology component lost, according to definitive data after the closing of trading, 199.61 points and stood at 1,983.73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index fell by 8.81 % (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points.
Wall Street has literally collapsed since the start of the meeting after an unexpected rejection of the Bank Rescue Plan by the House of Representatives, a plan that was supposed to allow some stability to be found again in the markets.
228 votes against and 205 for the representatives refused to provide Secretary of State Treasury Henry Paulson with the funds he requested.
Almost two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
“It’s a bad signal sent to the market that sees that Congress is not able to accept a certain plan,” said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"It shows how much the market relied on this plan," she added, expressing concern that the project adopted in a few days would not come "too late".
"If this project is really doomed to disappear . . . the staff will be immediately handed over to the Fed and other central banks to spark a crisis, which would further strengthen credit conditions," Brian Bethune said in a statement.
And with emphasis on the urgency of the situation, Piegza stressed that in the United States "every new day brings down one financial institution".
After the Washington Mutual crash on Friday, authorities organized the acquisition of Bank Wachovia’s banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly took a turn and demanded urgent intervention in favour of banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, suggesting that markets are facing "not just the American crisis, but the global crisis."
The bond market has risen sharply.
Revenue from the 10-year cash register fell to 3,632 % from 3,827 % on Friday evening, revenue for 30 years to 4,161 % from 4,357 % the previous day.
Obama wins points in first television duel
After Friday’s first debate between the two candidates in the White House, the second debate was followed, with the task of finding out which of the pair John McCain and Barack Obama won.
Republicans and Democrats were not surprised when they both announced their victory in a television duel that watched a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, however decent he was, was not "brilliant" enough to allow him to stop, five weeks before the presidential election, a drop in polls.
Gallup's constitution, whose public opinion poll published on Saturday attributes Obama a five-point jump (49% vs. 44% for McCain), believes the Democrat is the one who won the duel.
Among the indecisive voters that matter right now, Obama is the winner for 39% of those polled, while, according to a CBS poll, 25% attributes the victory to McCain.
Obama should be able to confirm his leadership on Thursday using the supposed good performance of his fellow candidate Joseph Biden, during his first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
“It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
It is given,” Clinton said at the end of the week.
Seventies McCain has consistently highlighted his undeniable experience in the field of foreign policy, while at the same time emphasizing his opponent’s “naïveness” on issues that formed the core of the first clash.
“Senator Obama doesn’t seem to understand that...” sounds repeated accusations.
“I don’t think Senator Obama would have enough experience and knowledge to become president,” he said.
In such an attacking spirit, the Republican television spots have been worn since yesterday.
Obama, on the other hand, emphasized that he represents the future.
He did not lose his head and turned out to be short and precise.
He highlighted his ability to make the right decisions and restore the good reputation of the United States in the world.
“McCain still didn’t understand, while Obama did,” a Democratic Spot told the Republican on the weekend that he didn’t consider enough the impact of the crisis on a “ordinary American.”
"During that ninety-minute debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama said in a statement yesterday before 20,000 people gathered at an election meeting in North Carolina during a heavy rain.
He hasn't even uttered words like "middle class" or "working." The financial breakdown clearly favors Obama, whom Americans consider more eligible to save the economy on the brink of collapse.
“Next week could be a decisive turnaround,” influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer said yesterday.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's "economic visibility" to that of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current disaster is “the final verdict of eight years of poor economic policy, as it was run by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.”
The Illinois senator reaffirmed that despite the unexpected leaps in Wall Street, he should be able to reduce taxes by 95 percent of Americans, and also warned that realizing the country's potential energy independence through the use of renewable energy sources is still a priority for the health system.
McCain plans to build a park with 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Both candidates carefully avoided questions about the <0x24>700 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>470 billion) financial aid plan, which was adopted by Congress last night and which is highly unpopular.
"What, did you notice that there were some elections in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents of the regime protested on Sunday evening on the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of parliamentary elections in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening immediately after the closure of polling stations on Minsk’s main square to protest the irregularity of parliamentary elections.
Although no results have yet been announced, many young people have come to demonstrate against President Lukashenko’s regime: “dictator, resignation”.
Some admit that they didn’t even go to the elections: “What would it be like to do with my voice anyway,” says one young man.
He does not believe that this regime, which has been friendly to foreign observers with a view to renewing negotiations with the European Union, would be ready to make a turn towards democracy.
Sanctions, including visa bans for 40 Belarusian sex workers and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if the election is considered pure by observers.
According to the opposition, this was not the case.
"We were kept away from the election commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the counting of votes," said Yuri Potemkin, a spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a diverse group of twelve parties.
"This is a cosmetic change," emphasizes Alexandr Milinkievich, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and a leader of the pro-European movement, "because it is important who counts the votes, and we have executive power.
If some opposition MPs enter the parliament, it will be by being nominated, not elected.
However, their access to parliament can mean space in television, meetings in regions and bills."
The opposition therefore feels obliged to participate in political functioning because "the dialogue with the European Union needs to be initiated.
If our economy, deeply indebted to Russia, is in crisis and we are not reforming ourselves, we are in danger of becoming the protectorate of Russia.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which followed the election, will not declare the elections valid.
It stresses that participation appears to be too high and that the general introduction of early voting (26% of the voters in Minsk) has paved the way for all possible manipulations.
“What about you, have you noticed any elections?” says Social Democratic leader Alexandr Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
“There was no leg in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition MPs in Parliament, the ones that are most in line with the regime."
The silence of the night sparked again in October’s square.
In television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission congratulate themselves on the success.
Conversation - Blood that is sure again
Hema-Québec celebrated its tenth anniversary yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, was rightly pleased because Hema-Québec has become one of the most reliable and effective blood suppliers in the world.
In particular, he regained public trust, which was severely shaken after the blood-contaminated scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is commonly known, the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Board’s state-owned blood reserve was contaminated by the immune deficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In view of this drama and public discontent, in February 1994, the Canadian government launched a public inquiry, chaired by Judge Horace Krever, to explain the circumstances that led to such a tragedy, and to formulate a recommendation to prevent such a tragedy from happening.
While Judge Krever hesitated to deliver the report, some provinces put in place a committee aimed at scheduling a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec this role was assumed by the Gélinea Committee.
Following Gélineau and Krever's report, two suppliers were established in Canada: Héma-Québec, which was to be managed by Québec, and the Canadian Blood Company for the supply of all provinces and both territories.
“When Héma-Québec started its activities in 1998, only 38% of people still had confidence in the Quebec blood system,” recalls Dr. Décary.
“The situation was awkward.
By consistent efforts to increase the safety of blood products and continuous work in this area, we have regained public trust over the next few years," he says, adding proudly that at the beginning of 2008, almost 94% of the Québec population had confidence in Héma-Québec.
Dr. Décary, however, does not lose sight of the fact that “trust is something very fragile.”
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
“At that time, we were witnessing in Europe many human-like cases of mad cow disease, new variants of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease,” says a woman who has been leading the company since its founding in 1998.
"And we didn't know if this disease could spread with blood.
We have therefore fought for one of the basic recommendations of the Krever and Gelineau report, according to which, in the event that we do not know this and when the spread of a serious disease is at stake, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by degeneration of the brain, must be prevented by death.
In April 1999, therefore, we rejected blood from people who had been detained in the United Kingdom for more than one month since 1980.
A few years ago, it was safely proven that the disease was transmitted by blood.
So this episode showed us that it made sense to stick to the precautionary principle.”
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for detecting HIV appeared on the market: tests using nucleic acid (NAT), which allow to detect in the donor blood the presence of the virus itself, rather than the presence of antibodies on which the tests were based.
NAT tests have made it possible to shorten the deaf period that occurs between the moment of the patient’s infection and the moment when our technicians can detect the first virus in the blood, the specialist explains.
We were able to reduce this period to less than a week.
We have substantially reduced the risk that some donors might be infected without knowing it and without we being able to lose sight of it.
This improvement has significantly reduced the risk of acquiring AIDS through a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of getting HIV-contaminated blood.
In other words, it means that before someone becomes infected with HIV, 12 million blood products will need to be distributed.
Since Hema-Québec distributes 400,000 to 500,000 blood products annually, it will take 24 years for the first case of HIV transmission through a blood product.
I believe that today we can get or prescribe blood transfusions necessary for healing,” said Héma-Québec chief executive.
“The challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
We never know what pathogenic element can appear in the system.
Just last year, a chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Reunion, similar to the West Nile virus, which is transmitted to the blood by puncturing insects.
It is necessary to be constantly cautious," continues Dr. Décary and stresses that in addition to safe supply, Héma-Québec must also count on sufficient supply.
“Needs are growing as the population grows older.
As a result of more aggressive treatment of cancer, patients often need a new dose of red blood cells or platelets.
The aging of the population also has consequences for the blood donor network, which on average consists of only 3% of Quebecers eligible for donation."
Every healthy person is at least 18 years old, which meets the eligibility criteria, but can donate blood only once every 56 days, that is, six times a year.
On average, 14% of people offering blood are not accepted because, for example, they have AIDS or malaria, and if they have visited the country where they have had a cold, they are excluded for one year.
“With these 3%, we can maintain a state that meets the needs of hospitals.
Deficiencies are very rare.
Members of the donor network, however, need to be supplemented in proportion to how old they are and can no longer donate blood.
However, persuading people to donate blood is difficult, especially then keeping them and encouraging them to become regular donors.
“Life is so unpredictable today that we rarely find an hour to donate blood,” said Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of <0x24>297 million, Hema-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissues such as bone transplants, heart palates, eye potatoes and skin, which is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québec, which also manages the only public bank of blood from the pup cord in Quebec.
Puppy cord, which was previously considered a biomedical waste, flows with blood rich on stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
“A few weeks ago, we celebrated the deposit of our thousand samples of blood from the pup cord into the bank and we assume we will take them out over a thousand a year.
At the beginning of next year, we should start offering them for transplants,” says Dr. Décary, who describes the blood sample program as very popular.
"Some moms are disappointed that they don't have access to it," because Héma-Québec doesn't have enough resources to offer this comprehensive and expensive program to all hospitals in Quebec.
Football - Impact in the semi-finals
The impact of Montreal yesterday at Saputo Stadium during the second and decisive game of the quarter-finals played for the total number of goals qualified in the semi-final round of the first division of the USL, thanks to the victory 3:1 (4:3 is the goal balance after both matches.
Antonio Ribeiro scored a decisive goal in the 90th minute.
After the first half of both sides, backers David Testo and Rocco Plancentino scored the remaining two Montreal goals.
Roger Levesque was the only one who managed to deal with Matt Jordan in favor of the Sounders.
On Friday, during the first of the two quarter-finals, the Impact suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex in Tukwile, in the suburb of Seattle.
The impact will measure its strength in the semi-finals with the Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, Thunder scored a 3:1 deficit in the home game and eventually won 4:3, but the Whitecaps still moved into the semi-finals with a total score of 5:4.
The impact is expected to collide with the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the series of matches will be confirmed until today.
Short - Kovalev's winning goal
Canada's first three strikers are ready to start the season.
A team consisting of Alexe Kovalev, Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Plekance and Andreje Kosticin last night at Centre Bell prompted an attack to defeat the Canadian 3:2 on a separate attack.
Kosticin, the biggest star of the clash, scored a goal, Plekanec collected two assists and Kovalev scored one draw in this fourth three-colour victory of the six preparatory matches.
Kovalev secured the victory by giving a single goal during the separate strikes.
"I'm not ready yet," Russ warned.
"I need another game to feel good.
“In the first quarter he tried to handle too much,” Guy Carbonneau said.
“I think he’s assessing the end of the game.
He had a nice applause."
Charest bets on the north
The Prime Minister does not rule out early elections by the end of the year.
Immediately after the end of the Liberal Party (Parti Liberal) summit, Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon in Quebec, where in today’s supplementary elections, the new health minister Yves Bolduc (left) is nominated.
"Leaving the borders of our last great northern border": this is the long-standing ambition that Jean Charest presented yesterday in a visually appealing way at the conclusion of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Lévis, but without giving details.
During his speech, pictures were thrown behind his back in some form of painting mill.
On three twisted canvases ran the loop with remarkable images of hydroelectric dams, down, Quebec from the view "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Charitable funds, similar to those in the election period.
At the press conference, the prime minister refused to rule out early elections in the fall, even though he warned that he had a very busy schedule.
The “Plan North” is the fourth dimension of the “vision” that the Prime Minister plans for Quebec, the “new economic space” vision that includes an agreement with France on labour, a convention between Canada and Europe and an agreement with Ontario.
Despite the fact that the opening of the North - the northern territory at 49th parallel - the Prime Minister has frequently mentioned in his statements lately, it has never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North represents a "great-potential market", but did not specify the term, the amount of investment, or a clear priority in future projects.
At the most, he mentioned several approaches to the points that could be further deployed: in particular water power plants, forests, but in particular the mining sector, encouraged by the growth of rapidly developing countries and the restoration of public infrastructure.
The North, according to Charest's report, contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds."
This "territory is twice as large as France is with us," "is in Quebec.
And it’s not just about us, it’s about us,” he said, as if he wanted to show that he was invoking a certain national founding myth.
Quebec was built to a large extent in relation to the North, the prime minister said: hunting for gold in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added after being silent theatrically to see the huge map behind his back.
The north, 70% of Quebec’s territory, covers a part of Labrador, which Quebec has always demanded, the prime minister said during a press conference.
“This is a traditional attitude that has been repeated by all governments to date.
"There is one border line that has long been out of place in the Convention, and if there is an appropriate opportunity, I will take that position again on behalf of the Government," he said.
Otherwise, "in the context of climate change, it is also necessary to reconsider our vision of the North," he said, speaking of the north-west transition that will open year-round as a result of the melting of glaciers.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that taking the territory becomes a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the land, the indigenous peoples and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government will be very attentive to them and that the project will be beneficial to them, especially for young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pequist MP from Hungary), have already begun negotiations with some thirty communities.
The Inter-Ministerial Committee, chaired by Benoît Pelletier, has an important role as Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources).
The prime minister does not exclude a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when "a common vision will be outlined".
The development of the North should, by the way, be carried out in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be “co-designed, structured and environmentally friendly,” he said.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as a continuation of the vision of the liberal prime ministers that preceded him.
“Like the liberals who preceded us, we have changed our mindset to turn the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
Such was, by the way, one of the still overwhelming themes of the weekend, which was launched on Friday with a big cocktail highlighting the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s rise to the front.
One of the resolutions proposed to rename the Beauharnois headquarters to the Adelard-Godbout dam.
“From Godbout, who founded Hydro-Québec, through Lesage, who carried out the Calm Revolution and Nationalization of Water Electricity, to Bourass, who created James Bay, our party was able to shape the future,” said Jean Charest.
At the press conference he referred to another authority, this time conservative, namely John Diefenbaker's "Roads to the North" program, which premiered from 1957 to 1963.
When it came to the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric power plant, Charest stressed that its launch is planned for 2012.
"I'm just saying it between us, but I plan to be there," he confided to his membership base, which caused considerable applause.
The same prime minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and no doubt in 2009, did not rule out the possibility to call elections in the fall of this year, allowing him to do so by law.
However, he stressed that his program is busy, especially on the mission of the federal council in China and the Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend summit provided the leader of the liberals with a platform for some nationalist resolutions, in particular some "trying to change the constitution", which went through very smoothly: the PLQ (Liberal Party of Quebec) specifically calls for recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also hopes that Quebec will nominate some of the members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Television Council, who would have the right to veto decisions taken in Quebec.
On the opposition side, the North Plan was skeptical in its main features.
The head of the PQ (Parti Québecois) Pauline Marois retracted the Northern Quebec Development Policy, which was launched by the Landry government in 2001.
According to her, when the Liberal government came to power in 2003, she renounced the implementation of this policy.
If she held on to it, "we'd be on today," Marois noted alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where elections are held today) François Mercure.
The ADQ said it would support the adoption of the North Plan in the government.
"But we want it not to be just a theater," said Sébastien Proulx, the leader representing Maria Dumont, who is returning from the holidays today.
Letters - The Disappeared Land
It was Vic Toews, the former minister of "justice" (for irony) in Harper's office, who last summer allowed himself to say about Louise Arbour that he was representing "hanbu" for Canada.
That's how to suffocate a woman who has led an unrelenting struggle for justice and who deserves all our admiration, that tells a lot about the premiere environment and about Stephen Harper himself.
We have before us a government that, as one of all the Western countries involved, has not transferred back to the country of its national detained in Guantánamo concentration camp.
The government, which does not at all take into account the fact that at the time of the acts that were to take place, Omar Khadr was a teenage boy.
The only government that, despite Canada’s signing of the Geneva Convention, denies its word and leaves a child soldier in inhumane conditions.
The only one who relies on a parody of justice to judge the defendant's guilt.
UNICEF, Amnesty International and, in particular, the Canadian Lawyers Association are defending Omar Khadra’s repatriation so that a fair trial can be awaited in Canada.
The same government closes its eyes to torture: it cares little about the fact that this young man is eventually psychologically destroyed, and it has undoubtedly persisted after so many years of distress.
We are unaware of this, but we are witnessing the nasty erosion of our rights, our freedoms and our "democracy," the words that Harper is so bent on and that sounds so empty from his mouth.
The time has come when there is no morale: it is possible to torture a Canadian citizen, to treat him badly, to imprison him at the will of the head of the minority government (as will be after October 14th...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in the party that proclaims Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and seriousness of our country.
It's a shame, Mr. Toews, in this resignation, not elsewhere.
Opinions - Orwellian discourse by Barrick Gold
In the September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Patrick J. Garver, executive vice president of Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
With Orwell’s logic, he confirms that the world’s largest gold producer has started prosecution of three authors and a poor little publishing house for insult to the honour in order to spark a “transparent public debate” and demands six million.
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge the truth, especially in the case of prosecution for insult to honor, but the law.
It is not surprising that Garver completely overlooks this crucial distinction.
Or is it the best way for Barrick Gold to lead a public debate, to put anyone on the table who would dare to defend the opposite position?
Whatever the case, the authors and publisher of the book Noir Canada (Black Canada) will be forced to spend respectable sums to be ready to fight and fight in a highly unbalanced battle with an army of lawyers backed by the almost inexpensive pockets of the mining company.
The tactics in these unbalanced fights, by the way, often consist in the destruction of defendants in order to bring about a peace process that will shut the mouths of the other party and further frighten anyone who dares to engage in this matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she had to present her view of the whole thing to the public.
Contrary to what is happening in several countries where Barrick Gold operates, in Canada there is debate under normal circumstances in the exchange of ideas, not in the wounds of a slippery slope.
The mining companies, therefore, have only opened up their books, documentation and real debate through newspapers, media, publications and funding of independent scientific teams that could bring light to the whole thing.
However, Barrick Gold does not seem to have confidence in public opinion and shyly rejects petitions and letters in support of the authors of the book Noir Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can demand a "public debate" while at the same time rejecting the opinions of the public?
In the Vice-President's world, this word seems to refer only to hard-paid lawyers, not all Canadians; it is a rather narrow concept of this concept.
In a democracy, the Nazis have the right to speak.
Barrick Gold does not understand – or does not want to understand – that the public who supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does so primarily because he rejects the brutal ways of the mining company.
The public is ready to use Barrick to hear and judge the matter, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, not within what many perceive as a prosecution, in which the defendant is to be silenced (in the context of his prosecution, the author has to have a "public debate" on the rights of the Barri society.
If we ignore Garver’s surreal speech, the prosecution initiated by Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the university’s freedom to seek and seek the truth that is essential to any democratic society.
It generally denies the right to quote credible sources and to debate facts and interpretations that constitute the very basis of intellectual activity.
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to study and discuss topics that the world’s wealthy firms do not like without being subjected to repeated persecution, who else will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could have formed it if it were to be guided by the scientific norms used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has the right to answer.
The university environment we belong to has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s exaggerated lawsuit clearly shows that despite what he claims, he does not have the slightest desire to lead a transparent debate.
For the university world, this is a loss, as is the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place measures to limit this type of unauthorized prosecution.
Wall Street Rescue Operation – Democrats and Republicans Understand
Bush’s administration and Congressional delegates, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the biggest rescue economic plan since the Great Crisis of the 1930s.
The new version of the plan, with the help of <0x24>700 billion, to bridge the financial crisis that has been ravaging Wall Street for months, must still be approved by both Houses of Congress.
In particular, it envisages: better control of elected representatives over its application, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of stored public money, new measures to capture the amount of houses confiscated due to non-payment, and also the right to monitor the amount of fireworks paid by work.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Senator Judd Gregg, Republicans at the negotiating table, announced this good news a few minutes after midnight, after the end of a two-day marathon.
"We have made great progress and reached an agreement that will be effective in the markets," said Bush administration spokesman Henry Paulson.
“Everything has been done so that the real economy and the ordinary Americans are safe from the crisis that is currently taking place on Wall Street,” he said.
“This is a crucial point: if we don’t, the trauma, chaos and disturbances of Americans’ daily lives will be huge,” Republican Judd Gregg said in a statement.
Over the last few hours, the negotiations have run to the maximum turnover because of the fear of the effect, which should be another failure in the mood of investors.
The time limit was set to open the markets this morning.
Both U.S. presidential candidates were invited to negotiate later on, and both expressed their support for the deal, but did not forget to express their dissatisfaction with the need to resort to such a far-reaching solution.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has signed a supplement to the agreement on certain measures, in particular those aimed at allowing homeowners to retain their residence, and measures on the pay of state-run workers saved by companies.
“When we ask taxpayers to take special measures because of the irresponsibility of some people, there is nothing to congratulate.
However, these measures are necessary,” he explained on television.
His Republican rival John McCain, who was asked by another station if he would vote for the proposed plan, replied, "I'd like to see the details, but I hope so."
“The rough features I’ve read [show] that it’s something that we’re all going to have to spend and that we’re going to be able to move on.
Choosing inaction is, in short, unacceptable,” he said.
The goal of the 700 billion plan is to buy back for taxpayers’ money dubious loans and risky and non-sales assets of U.S. financial institutions.
The plan comes after a 14-month crisis triggered by a real estate bubble burst, which first led to the collapse of risky mortgage loans (subprimes), then transferred to other, more expanded forms of loans (PCAAs) and resulted in the freezing of cash and financial institutions.
Last week’s first draft of the agreement was passed by Republican MEPs.
Since the Democrats have agreed that for some “toxic” assets of companies in trouble, the government will only take care of them but will not redeem them, there is a belief that the far-off situation is inflamed.
In an effort to approximate conflicting views in Congress, measures have been annexed to stipulating that the government will be able to introduce new fees that would help it get its deposit back if as a result of the program it will have to take over the losses for five years.
The new plan expects a first deposit of <0x24>250 billion, to which an additional <0x24>100 billion will be added if the president deems it necessary.
A further <0x24>350 billion deposit is expected to be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will get shares in the saved firms, which will pay him dividends in case of profit, and which will be able to sell again when it’s over.
The federal government will be able to delay the procedures for the seizure of the property related to the loans to which the plan relates, as well as set limits on the valuation and compensation amounts paid to the executives of the affected companies.
The snipers of the plan would like to put it to a vote in the House of Representatives today and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts being made, it is not yet certain whether their plan will be green.
Yesterday, votes against this project continued to rise, both in the Republican and in the Democratic camp.
"It's absolutely clear that Washington won't listen to you," Scott Garrett, a member of the House's Finance Commission, told voters.
“Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there is a solution.
But earning from taxpayers is not the solution.”
Democratic representative Brad Sherman, the moderator of a group of congressmen called the "skeptic committee", presents the whole thing differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred esteemed professors of economics, including three Nobel laureates, wrote to us: We ask Congress not to rush too fast and carefully examine the path to go,” he said.
At the same time, it has been reaffirmed in Europe that this crisis is a global crisis.
After the extraordinary meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.2 billion (<0x24>16.3 billion).
Intervention by the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after French bank BNP Paribas announced it was withdrawing from buying its competitor, which has been on the verge of collapse since it lost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2 billion (<0x24>2.9 billion) due to state-run risks.
Fortis employs 85,000 people, is among the 20 largest European banks and among the 10 largest insurers.
"We will not lose that money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
“In return, we gain the right to vote in the bank and influence.
And that’s exactly what stewardesses and households are able to appreciate in today’s uncertain time.”
On the other side of the La Manche channel, it seems, the British government has begun nationalizing another bank affected by the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government was expected to take over all existing loans from Bradford and Bringley, of which more than 41 billion (<0x24>75.5 billion) were loans to buy property.
According to its announcement yesterday, the Spanish bank Santander will buy the branches and accounts of the British bank's clients.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank after Northern Rock to be nationalized by the British government since the start of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death Socially Engaged Icons
His beauty with azure eyes for a long time represented his trump, according to other weaknesses.
Did this American actor with a charming smile escape from narcissism?
Yes and no.
The stiffness, sensitivity and unwavering talent that belonged to him also distanced him from the power category that produces true stars.
But what a long-distance runner!
Paul Newman died on Friday at the age of 83 in his Connecticut ranch due to lung cancer and remains one of the last icons of American cinema.
Less magnificent than Brando, to whom he was similar and for a long time a rival on the screen, Newman was a more cautious actor, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the breakdown of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces beautiful children.
Born in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jew and his mother was of Hungarian origin.
From these European roots was born one of the famous faces of the American dream.
No excess ego, which is the last sign of quality.
Because it saw the whole country in love with the self-made mana, a warrior in the Pacific War wounded in a battle that studied acting in Yale in the early 1950s, then visited New York's Actor's Studio and celebrated triumphs in theater, television, and movies.
The same man, who fought for civil rights, was also a car racer who placed second at the 24-hour race in Le Mans in 1979, and at the same time a sexual symbol, despite having formed a model couple with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With it also leave the stunning places of this hidden, discreet, socially engaged star, allergic to the habit of its own show-business, which will forever remain a mystery to some extent.
Hearing man, in the noblest sense of the word.
Paul Newman's departure this weekend caused film lovers to be dizzy, while his big roles competed together on a black canvas.
After him, he parades for more than half a century of the ever-changing American Seventh Art.
In memory, a charming cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), a young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in Cat on a Fired Roof, adapts Tennessee Williams from 1958.
From a less ancient past (1990), we are equipping his sensitive Mr. Bridge, a troubled in advanced age marriage that did not meet all expectations.
So many other Paul Newmans have entered history.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, tortured, violent, unforgettable delinquent from Somebody Up There Likes Me (In the Signs of Hate) Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, taken after his death, which Newman introduced in real life in 1956.
Sympathetic gangster in absolutely great The Sting, Oscar for best film in 1973.
A bitter and vengeful ball player in The Hustler Robert Rossen (1961), the same character portrayed in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, bringing him the only Oscar out of seven nominations in 1987.
This face travelling ages, it was him.
And he's back.
In his career, he competes in different eras.
Young people know him mainly thanks to the cult Slap Shot George Roy Hill (1977) from the role of Reggie Dunlop, an unconventional hockey coach.
Fans met him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
In 2003, he played the role of Irish mafia boss in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes.
Unlike a few film legends who left the craft fairly soon, Newman remained in the industry for a long time, although he condemned Hollywood with his slogans, showcases and concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, not without humor, "a live challenge of underplaying", to the court that he pushed too much on the saw in his performances.
For the beautiful Paul Newman, whose roles were coming up on the pitch, the profession was not always so gentle.
However, first lovers played less often than outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, lumps and despair, whose fall and rebellions were reflected in his perfect qualities.
As a director, Newman revealed little known sides of his shy sensitivity.
His 1968 film Rachel, Rachel (according to the Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), in which his wife Joanne Woodward starred, presents a sensitive female portrait full of melancholy.
His son Scott, whom he lost due to overdose, was given the 1984 film Harry and Son, a work of study and sadness.
In a tribute to Newman yesterday, his great friend and former companion Robert Redford (played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) sadly declared: "His presence made my life and this country better."
Charity, love of life, such are the main characteristics of a deceased actor.
If we forget his legendary career, there is also a great civil rights fighter, ecology, an independent film, an opponent of Hollywood’s collapse.
We used to see his image on bottles of wine vinegar, sauces, biscuits and other foods, which may seem quite tasty to us, although at first it was a gag.
However, the profits from the sale went to the account of his Heavy Childhood Foundation.
So Newman, rather than letting his fame swing, was engaged in the company until the last minute.
He left a letter to his five daughters containing the following sentences: "Always and until the end, your father was grateful to his happy planet.
It was an honor to be here.”
And for us it was an honor to follow the life path of such a clear and generous American artist.
And besides, after all, an exemplary citizen.
What was produced in the factory on the invoices of Zuschlag & spol.?
Soon, on October 8, the allegations will begin in criminal proceedings against Jánosi Zuschlag and his associates.
The politician and his associates are accused, among other criminal offences, including falsification of documents, of fraud committed in the long term and systematically criminal organizations, resulting in extraordinarily significant damage.
According to the prosecutor’s office, they used the money obtained in public competitions for their own purposes and performed tasks often with fictional invoices.
The money from the state and local governments – totaling about 65 million forints – was partly transferred to the Fiatal Baloldal cash register, partly to the pockets of individuals.
The manner in which the investigating authority was also informed was that the money received in public competitions was collected on the basis of invoices for which there was no real countervailing value and the commitments received by the association were never received.
According to the complaint, most of the bills were fake.
The prints for these invoices came from the Yozsefváros market, the round stamp was made in Kiskunhalas.
On the name of the companies for which the invoices are to be produced, it was decided, among other things, on the circuit road along the north bank of Balaton, to which István Lados sent János Zuschlag.
According to his statement, he was first appointed to look at guesthouses and restaurants.
In them he applied for bills for his consumption, according to which invoices were then produced in the framework of public competitions issued, inter alia, by the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, and the Municipality of the capital, respectively.
Most of the invoices were presented by István Lados and his partner Andreas <0xC5><0x90>rim, who, according to our information, most often wrote the reports necessary for obtaining subsidies.
During his "study trip", Lados looked at a cellar.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlag and its partners in 2003, this catering facility provided food for the ninety-nine-member group of Biztos Pont.
However, according to the company’s chief executive, so many people would not suddenly enter this facility.
Similarly, the formal and content errors of the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 to the foundation called Jobb Jö<0xC5><0x91>ár, later Együtt and Third millennium.
The guesthouse in Badacsonytomaja had only three rooms, more than ten people could not sleep in it one night, yet one hundred and thirty guests were listed on the invoice.
However, the fillers of the printing presses with a rich imagination have exaggerated this even when they mentioned on the documents the company dedicated to the same hospitality - Pigal s. r. o., in whose accounting, according to the information provided to the state representative, the documents that sound like the name of J Hopply and Jofigure.
Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas, head of the company for hvg.hu, said that when he was summoned to the prosecutor’s office and shown him invoices, he immediately knew that these were fake documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were on the badge in the wrong place."
In addition to the formalities, he added, there was no agreement that, according to the invoice, there were a hundred people who had only eleven rooms that had not such a large capacity.
In addition, the invoice also included meals, with their restaurants no longer functioning for a long time.
Hot invoices manufacturers did not even convince themselves that the outlooked Budapest travel agency organizes only foreign trips, and on the invoice with payment in cash, which also did not conform to the invoicing practice of the company, they stated foolishly as a service of travel brokerage.
In addition, as it turned out during the investigation, VAT was also mentioned in the document, although the organisation of travel to countries outside the European Union was exempted from VAT.
The four documents issued by the Jobb Jök<0xC5><0x91>ár Foundation by the Hotel Révfälöp s.r.o. did not agree with VAT, among other things. The company’s activities are not covered by the said 25 percent, but 15 percent VAT, in addition to the facts, the employees of the hotel were only exposed to the facts.
In addition, the "issuers" have corrupted the invoice by, for example, stating in one company how the investigation by the State Prosecutor appeared to be an activity carried out by road transport of goods, which the company originally based on investment advice did not perform.
The fact that the invoices issued to the foundation Egütt and the Third millennium and the 21st century associations of the Cultural Society and the Biztos Pont were fake also broke down due to formal deviations - which do not correspond to the format of the invoice and the incorrect stamp.
As in the case of Ravenna k. s. or the Sports Camp in Kunfeheró, whose representatives denied that they would issue the invoices.
For example, the counterfeiters did not notice that HIB s.r.o. from Nyíregyháza was in liquidation at the time (2001), when a group from the Fiatal City Association was eating at it, and that is precisely why, according to our information, the company’s liquidation commissioner would also deny that he
Invoices are consciously exposed
The second group of invoices consists of those who knew they were going to issue a fictional invoice.
The Esély Budapest Foundation has issued accounts for about four million forints for the Third millennium Foundation at the request of the organisation Fiatal Baloldal - Youth Socialist.
According to the allegations, one of the accused Ludovic Györfi brought the head of the company, Collab s.r.o., to issue a fictional account.
Biogate s.r.o. also cooperated with Zuschlage and its associates, currently in liquidation, which in 2003 supplied Jobb Jö<0xC5><0x91>órór Foundation and Atlasz and Vörösfeny<0xC5><0x91> invoices worth about five million forints, for which the real economy did not exist.
Even the money movement, because the invoices created were later cancelled, which the organizations have already forgotten to mention in their documents.
Another group of invoicing companies included those who had ties to the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was the authorized representative of Delta Trió s.r.o., a Ukrainian company that deals with the trafficking of fuels and motor vehicles, based in Budapest, where the company is not located.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of computing equipment worth approximately 18 million forints.
According to the findings of the investigation, these invoices were purchased by Cash Investment s.r.o., which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The manager of the company was a man from Romania, to whom Iván Kubatov was to hand over documents concerning the company in 2002-2005.
As we know, during the investigation, Kubatov admitted that he issued invoices on behalf of the company to the associations Atlasz, Hoppa and the foundation Egütt and Third Évezred and accepted their counter-values himself.
At the request of Iván Kubatova, the Romanian walls were founded by Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s.r.o. and Jos-Investment k.s.
In fact, none of the companies worked, according to the defendant, because they did not have a job.
Nevertheless, the companies were in his favour, because at the request of the co-accused lawyer Zsolt Szent, who also prepared their founding documents, issued an invoice on behalf of the companies to the associations Atlasz and Y-Generación connected to Zuschlaga.
On behalf of Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Kubatov gave a total of 15 invoices worth 14.2 million forints.
The State Prosecutor’s Office estimated that Kubatov had reached 10 percent of the amounts listed on invoices and VAT.
To issue fictitious invoices, this time for the selection procedure for the association Biztos Pont, the man also used Szi-Beri k.t.
In January 2006, the Y-Generation and the Association for Modern Hungary submitted proposals for the public competition of the Mihálye Táncsics Foundation (TMA), a public-profit organisation of the Socialist Party.
They gained 500,000 forints, but did not spend the amounts on the objectives set out in the proposals.
To avoid this, TMA submitted five fictitious invoices from Works Team s.r.o.
These invoices were found during a home inspection at the office of <0xC3><0x81>rpád Kemecsei at the Ministry of Education.
During the trial, some of the defendants are likely to describe the process of making invoices, as they have already done at the prosecutor’s office.
Interestingly, if the main defendant, János Zuschlag, decides to reveal everything.
His statement to date is not too detailed, and although he has promised several times that he will explain everything extensively, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest - in exchange for paying a large part of the damage, fifty million forints, perhaps the socialists have signed an agreement with him and Zusi will take it upon himself.
He may also have been offended by the fact that his requests for alleviation of the conditions of his detention, namely his placement in domestic prison, remained unheard of.
While the perpetrators of economic offences who have done much more harm than they have not done yet can walk freely or at least wait for the end of the proceedings against them in their homes, he does not have this option.
Psychology of Trumpfing: Why We Spend More Money?
At auctions, customers are willing to spend more money, overvalue goods.
The neurological and economic foundations of this well-known – and seemingly irrational – behavior were revealed to researchers in the field of neurology and economics at the University of New York.
According to their study, published in the journal Science, people in the eBay auction type competition do not want to delay, so they prefer to pay too high a price.
The research, using an experimental auction, attempted to map the scheme of this "game" in the nervous system.
One group of volunteers wagered, the other group participated in the auctions, using the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) method to examine the active areas of the brain of the subjects.
In both games, the participants were able to win money, however, during the auction game, an important element of which is to overlap the other side, the whole under the brain cortex, called the striatum, began to work intensively while losing.
This area of the brain plays, among many other functions, a role in the “self-rewarding” mechanism of the nervous system.
Screwing the price, therefore, according to the researchers, can be explained by trying to avoid a sharp striate reaction.
To support their theory, members of the research team from a number of economists conducted financial cross-sectional research.
At the same time, three groups have auctioned against one partner on different terms.
The control group was simply informed of the real value of the product, and they made the bets.
In addition, members of the other group were promised that if they left the game winners, they would receive another <0x24>15 for reward.
The third group received <0x24>15, on the other hand, before the auction, but in the event of a loss, its members also lost that money.
The difference between the two groups was, therefore, that one was highlighted by winning and the other by losing.
However, the members of the group playing "against loss" were willing to go higher than it was in the control and "winning" group, which confirms the neurologists' hypothesis.
“These results cannot be derived from any previously existing economic theory.
They have so far explained the phenomena observed in the auctions of joy of victory and avoidance of risk.
Only neurological imaging methods have helped us solve the conflict between these two theories, so we have now reached the third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, a professor at the Faculty of Economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When to See a Doctor?
Approximately half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is among the leading causes of death.
The number of domestic cases of hepatitis infection is estimated at one hundred thousand, however, only seven thousand of them are treated. The reason is that patients often do not know that they are infected.
The name hepatitis is an aggregate name for infectious liver damage caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities in their symptoms, symptom is hepatitis and jaundice, however the origins of the disease and the diseases caused by them differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses spread in two main ways depending on the origin of the disease: hepatitis type A and E by digestive means (e.g. by infected food, water), hepatitis type B, C, D and other viruses by blood and body fluids (sperm, mucous membranes).
In any case, travelers should be protected by vaccination against viruses A and B, the type C vaccine does not exist.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after the ingestion of the infected food, usually accompanied by nausea, weakness, abdominal problems, the urge to vomit.
Then, yellowing, lightening stools and darkening urine are formed on the skin and whitening of the eyes. Treatment can take up to two to three weeks.
Every year, a million people worldwide die from a more serious type of the disease, liver cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason is that, according to estimates, only one in 10 infected is medicated.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if not treated, it can lead to liver cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most infected people don’t even know about their disease, the cause of the disease destroys the liver cells contagiously, and thus the first symptoms will appear in many cases up to 20-30 years.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, the implementation of regular screening.
In three groups, this disease occurs much more often than the average: among people who underwent blood transfusions before 1991, among drug users and among people with tattoos.
Currently, the estimated global number of people infected with the chronic hepatitis C virus is 200 million.
Since the disease can already prove a routine laboratory examination, a person should contact his/her doctor if he/she notices any signs of unknown origin.
With early detection, the disease is treatable, the virus can be removed from the body, thus preventing infection and preventing the onset of cancer.
September 30 is the World Hepatitis Day, which was first organized worldwide in 2004 by organisations representing the sick.
Its aim is to highlight the chronic liver inflammation caused by these viruses, the causes of its occurrence and the importance of early detection of the disease.
Who believes in God doesn’t hurt that much?
According to recent research, faith in God acts as a certain analgesic that could ease the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists from the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment, examining how a person’s belief in the God of pain perception affects, the British daily Telegraph reported.
As part of a rather bizarre survey, 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists were subjected to electric shocks, while all of them watched a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholics were able to exclude much of the pain.
Thanks to the technique that investigates the human brain in detail, it has also been shown that Catholics have been able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for regulating pain.
The research is the first of a series of research, in addition to academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians from different parts of the university participate.
The exact test was carried out by attaching a sparkling instrument to the left hand of the experimental subject, which emitted electric shocks.
The researchers asked the participants to carefully observe two paintings: the 17th-century Sassoferrat's Virgin Mary and the Lady with Leonardo da Vinci's painting, painted in the 15th-century.
The authors of the study hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary would cause a certain state of piety among the believers, while the da Vinci painting was chosen because it was not too different from the first and seems to them to be a soothing impression.
The subjects spent half an hour in the MRI scanner and during this time received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive parts, while separately watching an image with a religious or general theme.
The Catholics said they felt "safe" when looking at the Virgin Mary, as if they were "settled" and "relaxed, they were filled with peace."
When watching a picture with a religious theme, they said they felt 12 percent less pain than when they had Leonard’s work in front of them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the research, believes that a similar effect can be achieved with the help of any highly influential image even in atheists, it is only necessary to find the right photograph.
“We should find a picture that will be very positive from the position of a mother or father,” the psychologist said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
“The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it will also change our personality,” Wright added.
After such great results, it is only a question of what effect it would have on the pain management of believers if they were shown a madonna by Leonardo or a painter of a similar caliber.
Would a look at the quality of the Virgin Mary mean even better results?
You are what you share with yourself
About its tenth birthday, Google can declare that people can find it in their pockets at least as well as in the sky above their heads; they know where they were on vacation, what the professional exams are going on and what they are interested in.
However, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company’s chief executives, this is still not enough.
However, as for the skeptics who are parallel to Orwell’s dark vision, the very essence of Web 2.0 is not clear to them.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that the main goal of Google is to collect even more personal data about users, which is necessary in order for the founders of Google to stick to their original intentions!, which he reportedly said:
According to Google’s spokesperson, after ten years of world-class work, the company is only at the beginning to be able to work with all the information.
Asked what in five years, Schmidt said he would like Google to be able to answer questions such as “what am I supposed to do tomorrow?” or “what work would be good for me?” — to ask such a seemingly straightforward question, not to ask it, but to ask it.
Not all internet users are well aware that during an internet search, the searched words are accurately captured and also what IP addresses were searched from and to which pages the searcher has moved.
Thanks to the Personalized Search service launched two years ago, for example, users can keep their surfing history, they can look back on what they were looking for and what they clicked on, which will then generate a system that will be tailored to the long term, and will be more customized to the service, and will be more connected to the service.
What if my data is being used against me, what if someone looks at me, what do I do? - users who are afraid to look at Google's data monopoly ask.
In most cases, the extent of potential power represented by the company is more threatening, the counter-reaction does not induce guilt in Internet users, fear of punishment, a desire for freedom or even a rebellion against power.
However, it is a confirmed fact that all search terms are not only captured, but can also be issued to a third party in justified cases, in such legal cases the personal rights of Internet users do not protect anything.
The most well-known example of recent events was perhaps the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google provided the Brazilian government with information that enabled the identification of the pedophiles from Orkut’s community pages established through it.
However, Internet users who are concerned about personal rights could still breathe in May, when the company, hand in hand with the EFF, successfully proved its truth in a dispute with the FBI: Google should not be in the future even by any article of the FBI to force the constitution to give it to the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully slammed nearly fifty thousand web addresses and thousands of searched terms, which it obtained with appeals for reinforcements before the years of the Child Protection Act, but failed to obtain lists of the money-loving, and searched lists of individual items.)
The view on Google is so contradictory: it is besieged by those who are afraid to provide their personal data because they feel that their privacy and privacy will be by starting to use Google services, being exposed to harm, and acting against it with the imagery of the company that belongs to them.
And so far, the American geek culture and its wild legacy, assembling enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, appearing in many countries, sees a new generation of bigotry in it, a "corporate that now feels like Windows," as opposed to its rival, Microsoft.
This may be because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not require an identification code from its users and does not want money for their applications; an open, free and constantly fresh source of information and a package of programs acts as a much more accessible, youthful, "cooler" of its users.
However, this can also be due to the fact that geeks accurately understand the very problematic relationship between the Internet and personal rights, which has brought with it one of the most inclined keywords of recent years: web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is nothing but cooperation, that we deliberately leave tracks behind and use the communication channels that we have available, and although their scope is different from everyone else, the essence remains the same: we show up.
An average young person can run a profile on several community pages from Facebook to Xang, which can easily connect with other services, such as Twitter or the last.fm app, which can record more music by it, they can listen to it, they can do it, they can do it, they can do it, they can do it, they can do it, they can do it, they can do it.
At the same time, we can read about a lot of exemplary cases, from which she emerges: a girlfriend in the morning, looking at the flood of photos of common friends, she easily finds out who her shy friend was spending the evening with, or the company can throw away her worker's life just because she's in a hurry, she's on her blog.
The one who lives online life is made up of what it shows itself, so we could define the basic thesis behind the behavior of today’s youth.
And if you want to hide something or at least avoid the Google monopoly, you have the option (e.g., start with Scroogle, which uses Google’s search engine, but intentionally leaves no traces).
For example, a large number of people don’t register on a community site, so it’s not possible to find them. Google’s online application from the text editor to the photo editor and the news portal can be exchanged for alternative versions that are not connected to the giant server parks and that may not be able to get the profile from us.
Public opinion is not too secretly waiting for Google to show off its teeth.
At its current value of <0x24>156 billion, the company is worth more than IBM (<0x24>140 billion), Intel (<0x24>124 billion) or Coca-Cola (<0x24>110 billion), AdWords/AdSense ad spaces are threatening the investments of advertising agencies and services introduced by Microsoft.
In addition, however, the critics of Google find the contraptions of the 2006 chronology of the chronology of the chronology, which gives an alarming impression: the top management, for example, completely rejected the protests of the employees after raising the chronology of the chronology of the chronology, the chronology of the chronology of the chronology of the chronology, the chronology of the chronology, the chronology of the chronology, the chronology of the chronology of the chronology, the chronology, the chronology of the chronology, the chronology, the chronology, the chronology, the chronology, the chronology, the chronology chronology,
One of the internal rules of the company sounds that it does not pre-advertise new services in advance, but only when it can be used, it is certain that the expected problems of the coming months and years can be avoided by the company's health in new places: while some people think of it as a matter of time, and they think that the project is a project.
The fact that Google compiles a genetic database can then serve as a good starting material for the next generation of science-fiction writers, Cory's famous novel "Scroogled" describes with orwellian reminiscences the future in which to help the human eye with fear.
Double killer from <0xC3><0x93>zd helped remove footprints of two young people
Two young people were interrogated by police in the case of a double murder in <0xC3><0x93>zd, according to a reasonable suspicion that they helped remove the trace of the crime, a spokesman for the Supreme Police Directorate of Borsod said on Tuesday.
The suspected persons have been involved in the activity and are currently accused of assisting in a criminal offence.
Both young people, according to MTI information two girls, are being prosecuted.
Assistance to a criminal offence is punishable by imprisonment for up to 5 years.
The suspect of the double murder in Ozda, a 23-year-old man, was taken into custody on Sunday.
He's suspected of a pre-planned multiple-slayer murder for witty reasons.
During the investigation, it was revealed that a 23-year-old man owed a larger sum to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to pay off his debt, so he dragged his creditor to a mall in <0xC3><0x93>zd last Wednesday, where he killed the man and then his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI information, the young man had prepared for the crime in advance, which is evidence of the murder of a gun hidden on the scene.
The weapon and the circumstances of its use are investigated by the police with the involvement of experts.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange made an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros – about five billion Czech kroner – were offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the purchase of a 100% stock package of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish side despite the fact that the Czech Warsaw Stock Exchange had previously been excluded from the circle of potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the state is the owner of the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wants to sell 60 percent of its securities in a few months.
According to the Czech Economic Journal E15, the offer of Poles is the highest amount that has been offered to the interested parties on the Prague Stock Exchange so far.
According to the Czech newspapers, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic Stock Exchange Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have so far made an offer.
The head of the Prague Stock Exchange, Petr Koblic, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner of all interested parties, and did not rule out that this could lead to the collapse of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated by experts in stock markets at 5-10 billion.
According to the shareholders’ agreement, approximately 90 percent of the shares could be sold out.
The largest owner of the Prague stock exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with approximately 25 per cent share, followed by Czech savings firm with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a. r. l. with 13.5 per cent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of the European Journals
In their comments on Tuesday on the deepening international financial crisis, the leading European charters are already reminiscent of "Second September".
We can thank the President of the United States for the global financial disaster, the Roman La Repubblica accuses. The President has not even been able to pave his own party in support of that fast-paid bill aimed at correcting this desperate situation...
Instead of the new Pearl Harbor, which reminded billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, we could talk more about the second September 11th.
Part of the Madrid press also sees a culprit in Washington.
According to the newspaper El Mundo, the world economy was brought to a close by the collapse of the lack of political leadership there.
The risk of the collapse of the U.S. financial system continues to rise, and the world will eventually pay for it.
Although Bush’s plan was not perfect, after a vote in Congress, Washington is in danger of not offering a political tool to solve the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the air – just at the moment when one of the greatest changes in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, according to the Geneva newspaper Tages-Anzeiger.
So far, individual states have the ability to throw a life-saving loop at cash institutions, and taxpayers have the ability to save them from collapse.
However, if more banks are dominated like cubes, then neither money nor improvisation will be enough.
In the long term, it is necessary for the Member States of the European Union to move through their national egoism and consolidate control over fragmented financial markets.
Only on Monday received more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion in staggering monetary institutions, according to the Vienna Der Standard, which fears that, like Americans, they will have to get deeper into their pockets in order to solve the crisis, even European taxpayers are becoming more realistic.
The European Union is facing a crisis that has been plagued by a tsunami on the old continent until now.
Rescuers may not have billions of euros right away, however, it would be good if they decided firmly in which case it would be reasonable to reach out to taxpayers' money to avoid even more damage.
Smart Car Imitates the Flying Boat
What would be the best method of developing technologies capable of preventing collisions if not the imitation of obstacle detectors occurring in the world of nature?
For example, bees.
The original strategic idea of the surprising project, presented at the CEATEC in Japan, injected boots to engineers from Nissan. It was about how to build a new generation of collision-preventing systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the BR23C biomimetric robotic steering system, a robotic mini car equipped with bee characteristics, with the ultimate goal of helping to create a system that can eliminate all collisions.
“Throughout the summer, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space, which is actually very similar to our safety protective packaging,” explained Kazuhiro Doi, Brand Director for Technology PR and Research and Development at the exhibition.
Composite eyes play an important role, allowing bees to see in all directions at a viewing angle of more than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the composite eye, engineers came up with the idea of a laser telescope.
It identifies obstacles up to 2 meters away from BR23C in a 180-degree field of view, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately turns into a collision prevention operation.
The obstacle is captured during a fraction of a second, then the robotized car begins to mimic the movements of the bees and by turning the wheels to the extent necessary to prevent collision immediately changes the direction.
Unlike any existing system, this destructive maneuver takes place in a completely instinctive manner.
“If it weren’t, the robotic car wouldn’t be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshijuki Ando, head of the Robotic Car Mobility Laboratory and Project.
It must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology fits the most vulnerable and innermost layer of the safety protective packaging, within which the collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what bees do to avoid further bees.
This process should not take longer than the eye blinking.
However, unlike bees, this movement cannot be directed upwards, downwards or perpendicularly, it can be only two-dimensional and only in the direction in which the wheels can be turned.
Instead of the endless possibilities offered to bees when avoiding, only the possibility of rotational movement, acceleration and slowdown was applied in the case of a robotic car.
BR23C uses lithium-polymer accumulators that are lighter and have a higher energy density, which means they have a longer lifespan than lithium-ion variants.
According to Andoa, instinctive, intelligent responses are important, not the ability to process, but less data storage.
This mechanism must process and respond only to a few incoming signals in a second.
It is not necessary to store and react using intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, so only memory of a few kilobytes is constantly used.
It does not require memory with giga or megabyte capacity.
This is the first step towards developing technology for immediate avoidance, which Nissan estimates is likely to get into serial-produced cars within a decade.
Another option may be to connect the unit to the GPS satellite navigation system, which, after avoiding obstacles in the road, would lead the motorist to the specified final destination.
My dear baby has a name already.
The <0x24>700 billion savings package law, which is to be divided into several payments and aimed at the purchase of low-quality loans from banks, is already in written form.
Half the amount will be used in the first round.
Following further talks, which ended on Saturday after midnight in the U.S. Eastern Time, congressional officials reached an agreement in a few days of ongoing debate on a <0x24>700 billion bailout package, Reuters said.
"We have made significant progress," Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic president of the House of Representatives, said in a statement that only the drafting of the agreement remains.
The package was also supported by Presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson said of the compromise: "The programme will work and be effective, but further steps need to be taken."
The written form of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets on Sunday at 8 p.m. Washington time (i.e. on Monday at 2 a.m. Central European time), however, it did not cause any special rise on the stock exchanges.
The draft legislative norm for the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilisation Act, which the programme is to be established, will be voted on by the House of Representatives first on Monday, then it will be the time for the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday evening, after reports of the deal were also welcomed in the White House.
"With the progress that was made overnight, we are pleased and highly valued by both sides' efforts to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement.
The program, by the way, differs from the Bush administration’s original proposal, in which it was supposed to be to spend a total of <0x24>700 billion on the purchase of low-quality mortgage-backed securities.
Now it is possible to spend the first half of a maximum of 700 billion, so that 250 billion will be used immediately after things are expected to be decided by Congress on Monday, and the Treasury will buy for them securities secured by mortgages, which will then be overvalued to 100 billions as a waste.
The program will be supervised by a special body, a member of which will also be chaired by the Federal Reserve Bank.
Spending the second half of <0x24>700 billion will depend on the next decision of Congress.
The Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic within the meaning of the law: it can simultaneously buy low-quality loans, mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, and other "essential" loans.
Purchase can take place within the framework of auctions and directly, said competent representatives of the ministry.
The legal norm will allow the companies concerned to participate in an insurance scheme, in which the Ministry of Finance will provide them with a guarantee on means of concern, for which the company will then pay the price corresponding to the amount of the expected damages.
According to Henry Paulson, the law provides the necessary means to spend up to <0x24>700 billion to meet the urgent requirements of the U.S. financial system, whether it’s a large-scale purchase of bad assets, insuring them, or preventing a large amount of systemic risk.
"We will take the necessary steps to be ready to enact the law as soon as it is signed," he added.
The chief banks, who have been in trouble and are waiting for state help, can, on the contrary, count on the government to reduce their deferral - which in the overseas slang is simply called a "golden fall".
Their remuneration will only be limited in certain cases, and these limitations will also depend on the way in which the Ministry provides assistance.
Restrictions basically mean that if the ministry buys in the framework of an auction, a tax exemption will be imposed on the gold slopes, unless the fallen bank managers are sent straight to retirement.
In the case of a direct purchase of low-quality loans, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the money for management is not exaggerated.
It should be added that the existing treaties on gold drops will not change, the restrictions only apply to new treaties, which should be another incentive to participate in the programme.
"This is the first case in U.S. history where legal restrictions on the remuneration of CEOs will come into force," said Barney Frank, chairman of the House of Representatives' Financial Services Committee.
In addition, the State in the banks participating in the program will have the right to acquire a share, which reduces the risk of taxpayers, because once the economy and the saved bank are on their feet, they can also earn on this transaction.
The plan of the proposal states that in the next five years, the President must submit to Congress a proposal setting out how the expected losses from the financial sector can be reimbursed to taxpayers.
On both sides, of course, there were voices expressing doubts about the plan.
"This is not what American citizens have asked us to do, because this is not what taxpayers' dollars are protecting," California Republican Congressman Darrell Issa said in a statement.
His Democratic colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, believes that it is precisely those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street that have been urged to adopt the provisions.
Industrial prices continued to rise.
Domestic sales prices in the industry increased by 0.1 per cent in August 2008 compared to the previous month, compared to 12.9 per cent in August 2007, the Central Statistical Office said.
Export sales prices in the industry were 1.1 per cent higher than in July 2008, falling by 3.9 per cent interannually.
Manufacturing prices in the industry as a result of changes in domestic and export prices were 0.7 per cent higher compared to the previous month, an interim increase of 3.2 per cent.
Domestic sales prices in the industry have risen by at least 0.1 per cent compared to the previous month.
Domestic sales prices in the manufacturing industry also rose slightly, by 0.1 per cent, compared to July.
The biggest price increase occurred in August 2008 in the leather and footwear industry (2.8 per cent), mainly due to the inter-monthly increase in prices in the flour and silk products industry by 4.6 per cent and in the footwear industry by 2.5 per cent, respectively.
The higher price level of plastics and chemical raw materials led to a significant monthly increase in prices in the chemicals and products industry (1.6%).
Price reductions occurred in the oil processing sector (1.4 per cent), the production of electrical machinery and apparatus (0.9 per cent), as well as - to a minimum extent - in the timber processing sector (0.1 per cent).
Prices for paper production and publishing and printing activities remained unchanged.
In the other sectors of the manufacturing industry, we measured a price increase between 0.2 and 0.9 percent.
In the electricity, gas and water production and distribution sector, which has a significant weight in the domestic sector, prices rose by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly as a result of the continued official increase in gas prices since 1 July.
In a 12-month comparison of domestic sales in the individual sectors of the processing industry, prices rose the most in the oil processing industry (32.4 per cent).
In the metal-processing industry, it was possible to observe a 13.2 per cent increase in prices in the sector of food, beverage and tobacco products, which is decisively weighted, then a 11 per cent increase in prices.
Price reductions occurred in the textile and textile industries (2.5 per cent) and in the production of electrical machinery and apparatus (0.3 per cent).
In other sectors of the manufacturing industry, the rate of price growth ranged between 0.6 and 9.1 per cent.
Overall, prices in the manufacturing industry increased by 10.2 per cent over the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas and water production and distribution sectors exceeded prices from the previous year by 18.7 per cent.
In terms of sector-oriented division, the highest monthly price increase (0.7 per cent) in domestic sales occurred in August in the sectors engaged in the production of material assets.
In the consumer goods manufacturing sectors, prices increased by 0,3 per cent, while in the energy processing and further processing sectors, prices remained unchanged from the previous month.
The largest increase in prices from the same month of the previous year was observed in the energy processing and further processing sectors (16.8 per cent) in August 2008.
In the consumer goods manufacturing sectors, we measured an increase in prices of 6.8 per cent, while in the case of tangible assets, prices decreased by 1.4 per cent.
Export sales prices of industrial products measured in forints increased by 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month, down by 3.9 per cent in twelve months.
Our domestic payments weakened by 1.7 per cent against the euro in a month, followed by 7.1 per cent against the dollar, up by 7.5 per cent against the euro in August 2007 and 15.9 per cent against the dollar.
Are you going to the U.S. next year without a visa?
According to Kinga Gönczová, there is great hope that around January 12 the U.S.-Hungary visa-free agreement will enter into force, the foreign minister spoke about it in Chicago before the heads of the local Hungarian community.
In her view, "now almost everything depends on whether an electronic road authorization system or control system is built overseas in a timely manner".
At the same time, it noted that the new system will not be allowed to enter, however, tourists will have to be allowed to register before departure.
The Hungarian diplomat has been continuing talks in Washington since today.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will pass the Central Cross with the star of the Order for Merit on the Republic of Hungary and will conduct interviews with foreign policy advisers of the presidential candidates of the Democratic Party Barack Obama and John McCain Republic.
Barack Obama and McCain are in favor of bailout
Barack Obama and John McCain, presidential candidates from both major U.S. parties, agreed on Sunday to secure their support for a <0x24>700 billion bailout package for banks, but there are also politicians who are demanding the resignation of the finance minister.
After a marathon of several days of talks between Congress and administration officials, it was announced early on Sunday that a basic bailout agreement was concluded.
The financial package, which aims to overwhelm the Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market, has become a central issue of the presidential campaign.
Both Obama and McCain are consistently deemed to be the most suitable of both candidates to pull the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent surveys at the same time as they got ahead of economic issues, Obama again gained some advantage and McCain’s spike, which he secured after the Republican convention nomination Sarah Palin for vice president, disbanded.
On Sunday, Obama expressed his hopes at an election meeting in Detroit that the 700 billion-dollar package bill will be quickly passed by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal contains passages relating to consumer protection, which he also supports.
"We must act immediately, responsibly (...) to your locations, savings, the entire industry, the stability of the whole economy is at risk," he said.
He didn’t miss the opportunity to call McCain’s idea of the economy outdated.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said: “Everything is going to happen a little bit . . . but doing nothing is simply not possible.”
As the Republican senator pointed out, the proposal illustrates the establishment of a commission supervising the Minister of Finance and the limitations of the deferral for senior officials he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not play a more important role in the negotiations, he himself was in daily contact with the minister.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House of Representatives will probably vote on the bill on Monday.
Press overview of the German-speaking region
The right-wing camp is uninterrupted, only the voters inside it have become more confident - so analyzes the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria Der Spiegel.
The Haiderovs are ready to rule Austria to prevent a red-black coalition.
The Mirror (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the left-wing German newsmagazine, Franz Walter discusses in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution Eats His Fathers" the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to a well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before its office took over the sad duo Beckstein-Huber.
Christian socialists have been restoring Bavaria for decades – and now these modern citizens are turning away from it.
The breakdown of the period is a problem for Christian democracy as a whole, and so does Angela Merkel.
Debakl was not completely surprising to the CSU, however, on Saturday ended a process that could have been predicted for almost exactly ten years: the indisputable hegemony of one state side ended.
Ten years ago, in 1998, CSU landed at 47.7 percent, for the first time since the 1950s below the 50 percent threshold.
This was repeated three years ago in the elections to the Bundestag in 2005, even in the so-called Stoiber period.
The reason is the modernization that the CSU has consistently carried out in this country and which is eating its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but at a very high rate, the secularization, the results of education, the settlement of Germans from the East and from the North in the developing regions of Bavaria, however, could not be without consequences for the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernisation is associated with the growth of opportunities, which also has its visible political consequences.
The right-wing camp is uninterrupted, only the voters inside it have become more confident, more critical, more selfish.
It is also obvious that in recent weeks the CSU has been the most distant of the classical civil classes; people in freelance professions, businessmen, individuals with graduation and higher education.
The CSU’s support has already fallen below 40 percent.
The Press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Vienna newspaper, in its article entitled "Who, with whom? The presidential parties are reluctant in the questions of the coalition" deals with the confused internal political situation created as a result of the Austrian elections.
SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to negotiate with <0xC3><0x96>VP.
<0xC3><0x96>VP announces the involvement of SP<0xC3><0x96> in its internal affairs.
The BZ<0xC3><0x96> appears to be open to all negotiations, the Greens do not yet want to negotiate a coalition.
The elections are behind us, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, the presidential parties were not allowed to look too much at their cards.
SP<0xC3><0x96> President Werner Faymann has confirmed that he wants to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
And SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to show that cooperation between the two sides is certainly possible – in some federal countries and in social partnership.
The question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current President of the <0xC3><0x96>VP, as Vice Chancellor, left Faymann open.
As he put it, the Schüssel-Molterer course has been re-elected for every fall.
Repeat this direction is not taken into account.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
Whether his side chooses the opposition or joins the coalition is still completely open on the side, these issues need to be decisively discussed within the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
BZ<0xC3><0x96> President Jörg Haider once again appeared open in all directions.
“To prevent the red-black coalition, we are ready to take on government responsibilities,” Haider said.
Yaróková: It is necessary to break the enchanted circle of poverty and segregation
The European Summit on Equality, which this year hosts France, the current President of the European Union, has begun in Paris.
Lívia Járóková, MEP of the European People's Party for the Fidesz Movement, as one of the main speakers of the expert negotiations in her message addressed to the plenary, drew attention to segregation in education, as it is one of the most serious injustices affecting Roma children.
The summit was opened on behalf of the French Presidency by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladimír <0xC5><0xA0>pidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Negotiations were held between invited representatives of governments, European social partners, the most important European rights organisations and civil associations active in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the group of MEPs, Fidesz Járóková pointed out that in addition to the discrimination that occurs when recruiting workers, Roma are driven out of the European labour market mainly because of their low education.
"The vast majority of young Roma do not have high school education, and as a result of the poor quality of primary education, only a small part of them can achieve higher education."
Járóková also stressed that education as a fundamental human right plays a key role in the exercise of other human rights.
Investing in early education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economies of the EU Member States.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to establish awareness of these connections in the broadest circles - between Roma and non-Roman children.
The sooner a Roma student starts school, the more likely it will be to become a productive member of the labour market; through income and consumption taxes they contribute to the national budget.
“It is the right of Roma citizens to ensure the right to quality education and to guarantee the removal of their non-high-quality and separate education,” said Lívia Járóková.
According to the MEP, coherence between the European Union and the objectives and actions is needed to accelerate the process of school desegregation immediately, and the correct compliance with the existing and planned anti-discrimination regulations is essential.
“It is necessary to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, it is necessary to give Roma children the opportunity given a democratic space so that they, as full citizens, can participate in the future of Europe,” Yaróková said.
The European Equality Summit, held annually since last year's meeting in Berlin, is a European Year of Equal Opportunities, which guarantees to everyone the objective of providing a separate forum to help achieve the objectives of equality and the elimination of discrimination on the national and European level.
CSU: Temporary Grace
The fate of Huber-Beckstein will be decided at the end of October.
Despite the sad election debacle, the debate on personal issues has yet to be postponed by the Bavaria CSU.
The party president Erwin Huber and Earth Prime Minister Günther Beckstein can still remain in their seats, the question is how long this grace will last.
The fate of the tandem, which suffered a disastrous 17 percent loss of votes, will be decided by the party’s extraordinary congress last weekend in October.
The members of the highly criticized duo were, in any case, allowed to hear that they would not be able to do so in their posts.
They tried to calm the angry members of the faction and the base who, due to the loss of the absolute majority, demanded a day after the "Bavarian tsunami" had taken personal consequences.
Five years ago – indeed, under Edmund Stoiber, who was still at the top of her career – she gained 60.7 percent of the Christian-Social Union, now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, but her strength was only 43.4 percent.
In Bavaria, the CSU produced 18% of Germany’s GDP for 46 years.
While conservatives in the southern federal country, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy, still hold a high position, they will be forced to coalition anyway in the future.
One of the first signs of reorganization within the party is the fact that he will be a member of a narrow inquisitive team, which will launch probe negotiations on a possible coalition of the Munich government with the liberal FDP, or with a right-oriented group of Seeber Free Voters, only the Vice-President will be the Prime Minister and the Vice-President.
It is ironic that Gabriele Pauli, a candidate for the Free Voters, got to the House, whose speech against Stiber was used by the Huber-Beckstein duo to carry out the coup, but then with an ambitious communal politician they did a ruthlessly short process.
CSU leaders are now focusing all their energy on how to stabilize Beckstein.
During the transitional period, an active role will also appear to be played by Stoiber, who has so far slashed the threads from the backdrop, the former Earth Prime Minister and the former president of the CSU called September 28 the most painful day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made several riding remarks to the CDU, which he said would have deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted the defeat as a warning to both the CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the elections to the Bundestag in September 2009, Merkel will not be able to become Chancellor unless the CSU, which played a significant role in the 2005 state-wide success, is somehow standing on her feet by joint forces.
According to Merkel, who has had a hard time hiding her disappointments because of the fiasco, the loss of CSU positions will not have a negative impact on the Berlin big coalition.
What is of course relative: treating the wounded CSU will not be easier and the crisis of social democrats will continue.
In Bavaria, the SPD achieved 18.6 percent of the weakest result since 1946.
Lukashenko:pozice - 110:0
There was not a single member of the opposition in the Belarusian parliament in the Sunday elections.
According to Russian observers, this can be explained by the well-being and stability prevailing in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) by the illegalities that occurred in the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the election.
Although the 110-member legislature of the 10-million-member country has been lacking the opposition for a decade, the opposition, united under the United Democratic Forces (UDS) before yesterday’s election, had seriously hoped that the Lukashenko parliament, which had left the 2006 parliamentary election to "revoke a constitutional change in the polls in the polls".
The ODS has also resigned from the previously considered boycott.
Against the backdrop of the opposition’s expectations, it was politically that Belarus would become more and more economically dependent on Russia as an anti-Russian country – which, to mitigate the impact of Russia’s constantly irrigating imports of natural gas, took credit and also contributed to prevent Beltransgaz from becoming a politically independent, politically, and politically-democracy-owner in Europe.
He pointed out earlier that the OSCE stressed positive shifts in the evaluation of the election campaign, not shortcomings – for example, the ban on candidates for one-third of the opposition candidates.
However, the Monday flash report of the OSCE already had reservations about the campaign, during which opposition candidates could not essentially appear in the press, especially then that the opposition could not be present in the counting of votes.
At the same time, according to the opposition, only improvements can be felt in the political system: political prisoners have been released and Minsk is willing to give up with Moscow even in smaller confrontations, if it continues to refuse to recognize the country of the former Yugoslavia, South Ossetia, Nizhny Novgorod, and Abkhazia.
"We have taken two steps forward and one backwards, but most importantly, the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," Alexander Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that this continue, despite the fact that "it is too late to let into the insignificant parliament a single member of the opposition".
In view of the results of the opposition, he does not plan protests, rather he tries to deliver his message to voters about the need for economic reforms.
"Of course, we have a lot of problems with this, we have to print the opposition letters in Russia, the distribution is being hampered by the local authorities, yet I see that the change is supported by more and more people, even among the older ones," Milinkevich said, adding that Lukashenko's and Yankees are not the only ones who support the change.
“Due to the country’s debt and the growth of the trade deficit, it’s only a matter of time when social security will collapse, the ‘silent cemetery’,” says Milinkevi<0xC4><0x8D>.
In contrast to opposition politics, Russian observers viewed the election as democratic.
The head of the Community of Independent States, Sergei Lebedev, told Russian intelligence agency Ria Novosti that “people don’t believe in words but in actions,” so the absence of the opposition is nothing more than proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From breakfast before work"
This is the first time in the history of the Chigi Palace that a rotating door was introduced at the arrival and departure of employees.
However, from today, this new measure will begin to work against lubricated people, against those who bite themselves and then go to coffee during work hours.
The news was announced today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renate Brunetta, and the Secretary General of the Presidential Council, Maureen Masi.
“The rotating door,” says Brunetta, “is a tool for better work, higher performance, more presence and more services.”
“A new era of accountability and transparency is now opening up.
This is reformism,” Brunetta added.
With the Chigi Palace, we will complete the implementation in all the buildings of the Council Presidency.
For Masiho, "the choice of rotating doors is also important from a symbolic point of view."
There were no objections on the part of the employees, the Secretary-General assures: "It was a common procedure with the workers and the cooperation of all".
In short, no more breakfast at work; no more coffee and croissants.
Brunetta smiles and says, "There's nothing better than a good cappuccino at seven o'clock in the morning."
During a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
In Rome, the minister finally announces that within three months, the absence of public employees for the disease has decreased by 50%, that is, by 60,000 more people a year at work.
And he adds that it is necessary for the Italian public administration to become more powerful.
“Its pay dynamics – explains the minister – has doubled in the last 8-10 years from the private sector and is far higher than the inflation rate.”
Meanwhile, thousands of public employees have come together to reject the Brunett Decree’s standards in line with a request supported by Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Administration today presents figures on lower absenteeism at work due to illnesses - the Consumer Protection Association writes - the nation of 'wary lizards' is constantly growing.
“In Italy, we have thousands of productive and correct public officials who have gathered to declare war on the illegitimate norms contained in the decree.”
Tara will protest, in particular, against the exclusion of surcharges for disease-dependent activities; the extension of the time period during which the patient can be checked, the time period in which inspection visits will be carried out, and against the other standards included in the new ministerial regulations.
Work Accidents, Napolitano: "Resolute Prevention"
Every day in Italy, 2,500 workplace accidents occur, three people die and twenty-seven remain permanently disabled.
The Inail figures confirm that in 2007 we have about 1,200 deaths as a result of occupational accidents.
These values bear witness to the seriousness of the incident, which remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost double the number of deaths compared to murders.
To bring back the attention of the institutions, social and information media regarding this dramatic problem, Anmil is celebrating today in all Italian regions the 58th National Day of the Victims of Labour Accidents, set for the second Sunday in October.
“The worrying data extended by Anmila and the same tragic reports these days confirm the importance of the issue of occupational safety,” said President Giorgio Napolitano in a statement sent to President Anmila, the National Association for Frozen and Frozen People.
“The Head of State expresses its vivid admiration for the ongoing joint effort on safety at work, on the protection of injured workers, on the assistance of families of victims and on the sharing of public opinion.”
"Naturally, a revolted 'enough' has been raised, honestly shared face to face with tragedies, which by their extent provoke agitation in the media and the participation of public opinion, but the everyday reality offers us again its dramatic cases, which are even more contagious."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is, without a doubt, a resource problem: it is decisive to invest in training and awareness.
A number of initiatives in the field of education are of particular importance in order to make the young people who are facing the world of work more aware.
It is necessary to draw attention to this phenomenon, not to give up due to its disturbing social gravity, to apply and improve legislative standards.
House President Gianfranco Fini, for his part, stressed, "how the phenomenon of death as a result of the accident at work creates an absolutely critical social state, how it offends the conscience of each of us and compels all institutions to make convincing efforts to end it."
"As for the data on work accidents, they appear to have some positive turnover, but this does not deny that the number of deaths as a result of work accidents is as alarming as it is," President Anmila Pietro Mercandelli said.
“We don’t want this ‘trying to reduce’ to lead to less attention, because just as soon as attention stops, tragedy will erupt.
“We believe that there is still too little work being done in general to stop the problem of injuries and there are many activities that can have an impact on this problem.
In our opinion, it is necessary to increase controls and inspections, but also to intervene more strongly in the field of training of workers, right from school age."
"There is still a need for further efforts - he added - in terms of communication and sharing of public opinion.
But above all, there is a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards the phenomenon that represents an exceptional social phenomenon."
Mercandelli finally stated that it was a progressive degeneration of the level of the right to compensation expected for labour victims and a "deferment of supportive care" to which the system has been receiving in recent years.
“The goal is to return the worker’s insurance guarantee because the fate of those who hurt themselves must not depend on spontaneity or time-consuming by the legislator,” he added.
Mp3 Players Accused, Exposing Hearing Risk
Listening to loud music for a long time and using portable music instruments like Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing loss.
According to a communication published today by the European Commission, which cited in an official report extended in Brussels the opinions of the Scientific Committee on Health Risks, which have recently been identified (Csrseri) Eu.
“From this scientific point of view – we read in the notes – it turns out that 5-10% of those who listen to music using portable musical instruments for at least five years, weekly for more than an hour a day and keep the instrument at high volume, are at risk of loss of permanence.”
“I am concerned that such a large number of young people who often use portable music devices and mobile phones at high acoustic levels can unwittingly damage their hearing in an irreparable way,” says Meglena Kuneva.
"The scientific findings - the leader continues - show a clear risk and we need to react quickly.
The most important thing is that we need to encourage consumers and publish this information.
We need to continue to re-examine existing control systems in the light of this scientific finding, so that they become fully effective and keep up with the new technology.”
Brussels has asked the Independent Scientific Committee to investigate this issue in view of the high use of portable musical instruments and the growing number of young people exposed to the noise of this origin.
"Scientists confirm that there is a need to worry and now the European Commission will examine together with the other members and parties that have raised the problem, what measures it would be possible to re-introduce and thus better protect their children's clothing, clothing, and children's clothing from bullying."
Currently, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical instruments to 100 dB, but there are growing concerns about hearing impairment, which may be caused by excessive exposure to similar forms of noise.
It is possible to greatly reduce these damages by looking for solutions such as reducing the level and duration of exposure.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee states that users of portable musical instruments who use loud music (more than 89 decibels) for a period of only five hours a week will exceed the current limits corresponding to the maximum permissible volume.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods of time risk permanent hearing loss after five years.
This problem should affect 5-10% of users of such devices and their number can be counted between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno leaves free passage Commission for the future of the capital
We will start today, we will close in March, we will have sums in June.
This is the calendar given by Campidogli to the workers of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome", which met this morning at its new headquarters behind the Caracall Spas.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and 49 other members of the Commission will draw up the Rome Guidelines.
As soon as the doors, Giunta and the city council are closed in March, the analysis and projects will be evaluated so that in June they can present a strategic plan for Rome with the "official seal" of Campidoglia and his councillor Gianni Alemann.
“The Commission is completely independent and includes all political, social and cultural ideas – he wants to emphasize Alemanno – It will have to provide proposals for the development of Rome, which will ultimately be used by the political arbiters who remain the Giunta e General Council.
It’s not an exchange of functions, but just an attempt to have some place to work on a big project for Rome.
The work will be completed in March and then disbanded, because these institutions must have an exact deadline.
In June we will present a strategic plan and use the work carried out by the Commission for the future of the capital city of Rome."
To those who accuse the Commission of being unnecessarily unconstitutional, Alemanno says: "It all depends on the work the Commission will be able to do and on the quality of their proposals.
If they are of high quality, as the Commission's proposals for Attala, and so I am sure in Rome, its contribution will be decisive.
Too often politics pays off on everyday problems and on the urgencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look further and further, in a deeper perspective, to work seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the mayor of Rome wants to stress that "this Commission is neither a superfluous enterprise nor a bluff: it is completely free, the citizens of Rome will not be a euro and will serve to rethink and engage the best intelligence the capital has".
For Alemann, in essence, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan as a starting point, neither definitive nor immovable, in order to allow our city to rise to the level it necessarily needs, and to think in a unified spirit about its future."
The future which, according to the mayor of Rome, "will not be limited to the current municipal border, but will look much further" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status, but "also includes the role that the city of Rome can and must play as a city of Europe".
Obama? The first anti-American president. You already know why
One famous American president wrote that it is important for him to remain independent: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.”
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, through his decisions, decimated the U.S. economy and maintained (as a private citizen) relations with the enemy of Islam.
Attacks against Obama are on the rise just as the election date approaches.
A woman from Miami wrote on the web: “This man is full of ambition.
But Obama has the audacity: he thinks he's going to get to the top post of a nation that has two governors and five black senators everywhere!"
In fact, these attacks don’t say much; they’re attacks clearly of racial origin and they don’t answer the voters’ question: Will he be a good president? And then we have the polls; they all say Obama will win and with a big jump.
Even in this case, there are those who act according to the heart and not according to the brain.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the south of the United States, wrote a comment: At least once in the polling station we know well who the American patriot will give his vote.
There is one side of the American mentality, which remained shattered until the last moment.
“Say what you want, we’ll eventually take care of it ourselves, who we’ll pick up, whether Obama or McCain.”
There are people who swear that if Obama had to win, we would have left America.
These are things that have never been said before, it seems almost certain the success of a black candidate.
But despite all these considerations for Democrats, the main weapon is George Bush.
1,500 people asked: What mistakes did Bush make during his tenure? Eighty-nine percent answered: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and sent him home with a dig in his ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers were killed and the Americans were not forced to pack.
And yet, Iraq has become Bush’s weakness for most.
Whoever takes the place of Georgie W will have to do a huge task.
The U.S. economic collapse has also been felt by journalists: there is a period of investigation in the newspapers, and many accuse the Internet, the "killer" of the press.
The PEW Research Center asked five hundred journalists about the status of their profession and the assumption about the future.
Nowadays, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, the questionnaires did not openly say that they had less concerns about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they used to.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
For these journalists, the crisis of 2008 is a crisis of a destroyed economic model.
In addition, cuts made in the newsroom, the room where editors work to put newspapers together, are a huge problem.
According to the journalists questioned, this is a problem that needs to be solved if we do not want traditional journalism to change fundamentally in the way it is understood by the general public.
American journalists have a clear but complex pessimism.
Six out of ten press journalists and senior executives are convinced that journalists at the national level are going the wrong way.
In the local area, the executive group is 65%.
Printed against the broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to see where the website is going.
Larger publishers are paving the way for the internet, which many see as a "killer" of the press.
“Economic pressure,” which journalists have warned, has increased by up to 79%.
Five hundred interviewed journalists admitted to resorting to technology in the hope that they would "do something good" for their journalist.
The biggest gap in American journalism is between those who run newsrooms – that is, leaders – and the reporters who work for them.
56% of leaders at the national level are confident that their reporters share their values, while at the local level the value drops to 23%.
This has to do with "work security" for someone.
Leaders who think they will lose their jobs within three years are 47% at the national level.
As far as journalists are concerned, they move to 30%.
When it comes to "certain work" related to staff (our editors, ndr) in America is still on a daily basis.
Only 13% of journalists work on the contract.
In such a huge nation as the United States, with three hundred million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radios, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, so it’s a question to take or leave.
Leaders almost always get huge salaries and the editor can earn as much as <0x24>10,000 a month in addition to paying pensions and insurance.
As far as the holidays are concerned, the argument is complicated: a certain number of days after the first year, a certain number of days after the third year until the fifteen days after a certain number of years.
However, American journalists, according to their own confession, often get sick within a year.
It's just a question of climate.
UNIPOL: JUDGMENT IN ROME, DANILO COPPOLA REFERRED IN GROTTAFERRAT
The President of the Second Criminal Senate of the Roman Court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the submission of a real-estate businessman, Daniel Coppola, who requested that he be able to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to an apartment in Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in connection with the sale of Unipol-Bnl.
During the trial at his own expense, he was released from home jail last week, which was turned into a forced permanent residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni e Gaetano Pecorella, demanded that the entrepreneur with realities be able to change his place of residence from a rural town to the capital.
However, according to the court, this move (against which he expressed pm) would allow him to influence his company and get to the evidence that accuses him.
Elite in Danger
This phenomenon occurred just a few days ago when the House of Representatives voted against the <0x24>700 billion bailout plan for the White House: a significant portion of Americans were more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is confirmed by the New York Times yesterday, which informs us that the current crisis is ravaging the Republican side, which is constantly more divided between its old East Coast soul, more mild, responsive to the federal institutions and the business community, and its new financial force, which, on the contrary, is in the backdrop.
The soul that was arrogantly expressed by the vote that I spoke about at the beginning.
But this is just an example of the changes, the major changes that the current economic earthquake already shows: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and perhaps not only here.
In both the United States and Europe, this crisis seems to act as an accelerator for phenomena that have been in incubating for a long time, which are stagnating in the new climate and finally coming to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the extraordinary revival of the market, a dual category of state-power in relation to a certain re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis is indeed a crisis of banking financial institutions, which, of course, have strong ties abroad, but in which, above all, the budgets of people and families living in a single country, in a single state are included.
This at the same time created a political problem for those who run it: it means how to respond to the problems and protests of people and families who are among other things voters.
In short, the crisis appears to be economically global, but politically almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems to be substantially out of play or has little power to add: the European Union has given clear evidence, which is, as always, divided between different interests and different national strategies and which cannot decide for a single common political line.
And so everyone is awaiting the intervention of the governments of each individual state, rescue plans, market recovery, new rules and, above all, the allocation of funds: the moment we get into trouble, only the states have the economic resources, the amount of financial resources to put all of them to the test.
And he also has the necessary resources and powers to use them: two sources of immense value, under certain circumstances, in which perhaps no market and no international organization will ever be able to have such a degree.
This new emphasis, which the crisis places on the national element, is, by the way, in full conformity with the ever-increasing importance that seeks to attribute the last economic progress to one factor closely linked to it: territorial jurisdiction.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we were entering the kingdom of the net, increasingly sophisticated technology, intangible, while we were convinced that global finances were already predetermined to rule the world, they were not going to have to know anything about our future.
All things, who would say that, can be moved from one place on earth to another, but in any case, they are connected, absolutely, to a limited space, territory.
So, whoever becomes their ruler must have much more cards in his hand than anyone who is not and who has the misfortune of living in a place without grain, oil, and water.
I'm getting to the second newspaper, but it's predicting a breakdown.
Who talks about territory, state, government, inevitably talks about politics, that is, leadership.
Given the economic crisis, two convergent phenomena appear to be emerging.
On the one hand, he realizes that there is an objective need for authoritarian leadership, an application for someone who can handle the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discreditation towards the existing leadership, especially the economic one, which turned out to be equally inadequate and full of dark places.
And together, something even deeper and in a certain sense disturbing: discredit, intolerance, feeling of incompetence and absence, which are trying to control the entire ruling class in more and more Western countries.
It seems, in fact, that the beliefs in the broad masses of the population are more and more widespread than that their actions are the same as the ideas of the popular elite, their way of feeling and being, their culture in the true sense of the word, that the elite has already surpassed their time and is indifferent to the view of the elite.
In short, the demand for leadership nourishes one branch from the underground, but the strong movement for the removal of the ruling classes and the traditional political order manifests itself in the pro-British "repulsive" and "repulsive" elections (or in the "repulsive" and "repulsive" elections) and in the most unexpected changes in the collective recessions.
We have the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, and even their ceremonies, their newspapers, their accredited intelligence, someone would say their format, have ever greater problems to understand, therefore to represent, which, not from today, is created in the deep layers of Western societies, by the breakdown, the potency, and the economic downturn.
Before this, it would be exaggerated to talk about a permanent "mass rebellion".
But we certainly can’t say that it means having the eyes open.
Super glue for walking on the walls
Overcome the laws of gravity thanks to super glue and in the future walk around the walls like Spiderman.
This is the object of various U.S. research centers and now a team of four institutes has come very close to it.
Scientists managed to keep the stokilogram body glued to a vertical wall using a sticker of just 2.5 centimeters square.
STUDIUM – The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgian Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of researchers is the development of existing materials that use a special carbon structure called carbon antler tubes.
“The basis of the glue can be imagined as a series of tubes placed as an organized pile of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgian Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of the gecko, covered with microscopic hairs that allow the animal to provide the perfect grip.
Tests carried out on various materials, such as glass, teflon and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the legs of these patches and at the same time "simply sticks off the wall," explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the Faculty of Engineering Dayton.
"This material could be useful as a temporary adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Probably to walk around the walls like Spiderman? Probably yes, but researchers are thinking about a far less fascinating use as a connection of electrical appliances, because dwarf carbon tubes are the conductors of heat and electricity.
Other applications could be related to aerospace engineering . .
So far, no superheroes.
READ MORE – The University of Berkley, California, is also dedicated to researching the new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society, California scientists have described adhesives made from microfiber as hairs that clean themselves from dust by moving across the surface to maintain perfect adherence.
Medications: Never with juices
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
If you take these drinks, which are consumed mainly in the summer, because they are refreshing and full of vitamins, along with some life-saving drugs, their intake changes to enhance or decrease the effectiveness with serious health consequences.
In order for David Bailey, a professor of health effects at the University of Western Ontario in London to emphasize the risks of both fresh and ready juices in combination with the consumption of certain medications, at the 263rd National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he is calling for a new epidemiological alarm.
Grapefruit juice has already been accused of being responsible for increasing to the toxic level the effects of some antiarrhythmic drugs, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamines and neurological drugs.
MEDICAMENTS IN RISK – The Italian Medical Agency itself announced this in a bulletin two years ago and instructed doctors and patients not to underestimate the risks arising from this mixture and to pay attention to what they are drinking in case they are taking medicines, such as Diapa or Medon.
GRAPEFRUIT – According to experts, orange and apple juice also contain substances that suppress drugs.
A long list of effects dimmed with grapefruit and other juices.
Michele Carruby, director of the Department of Pharmacology of the State University of Milan, said: "Such discoveries are usually immediately reported to various international and national pharmacological agencies, which will eventually arrange and exchange instructions for medicines.
So always read the illustrative leaflets of medicines you get, and if you encounter something unclear, don’t worry, but ask your doctor or pharmacist for clarification.”
Paul Krugman 's Nobel Prize in Economics
The Nobel Prize was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his study of commercial models and the localization of economic activities.
Krugman is a 55-year-old New Yorker who teaches at the University of Priceton and is a well-known editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most important critics of the Bush administration's foreign, economic and political actions.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, the days when Enron crashed, Krugman predicted in a commentary published in the New York Times that the second event would be, in terms of the consequences on the history of the United States, much more important than the first.
The prediction that caused a lot of controversy and that was calculated to him over the years, but turned out to be accurate.
“I am surprised and shocked at how quickly the collapse of Enron and Worldcom disappeared from the public interest,” Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenz Bini Smaghi of the Central Bank’s Executive Committee, Krugman is a “great-important economy” but also a popularizer with a “very aggressive style, especially critical of Bush’s liberal administration’s excesses.”
Open Office, here we have the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It is the day of the release of Open Office.org 3.0, an open source personal production package that aims to penetrate more and more users, from home to office, from experts to public administration, as a free alternative to the more popular Microsoft Office.
After about a year of work by volunteers, controlled by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office is showing up to the general public with a variety of new features: to the welcome screen and to the revised and improved opening window, additional Mac2 standards are added, much more significant, such as ISO1 standard, nOS compatibility, and X-support for the operating system.
Emphasis is placed on working with Office 2007, Open Office is able to open the document with a new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting are the special features of some models, such as what allows you to reduce the size of your PowerPoint presentation, useful for example for electronic transfer, or the ability to transfer a PDF folder to a graphics model and maintain the original page appearance.
Still from this point of view, we can create "PDF hybrids" documents that resemble typical Adobe format graphics and have the features of a table processor or text program.
Collaboration is an element that has gained many improvements within application programs: in Excel it is possible to work together between different users and avoid conflicts on changes, in the text program, each collaborator is assigned a single color to the comments to be re-identified.
Some companies are also working on transferring some Open Office features to the Web (on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should reshape the definitive result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://en.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, it has been added to the English version, which is on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual, the package is also available for the Linux operating system.
The installation CD can also be sent to your home or workplace on request.
And if the topic of freelance can be the cause of expansion in households, it is the business area of the Open Office packages that plays a lot, and can already count on a variety of projects implemented in public administration and schools.
And there is no shortage of training, consulting and assistance services ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could open up business perspectives.
Open Office consists of five main models: Writer, for video writing replacing Word; Calc is a table processor that is aimed at replacing Excel; Impress for PowerPoint-like presentations; Dbase, as in the case of more famous Access, is a program that allows you to work on databases.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that to date we are almost at 3 million and 600,000, with the release of a new version it is possible that this expected number can also be surpassed.
Also Kohl results are positive, this is the fourth case of doping
A new positive case at the last Tour de France: this is Rakushan Bernhard Kohl, from the Gerolsteiner team, the third-classified and winner of the top top shirt.
The report was quoted by the newspaper L'Equipe.
26-year-old Kohl is the fourth racer positive for Ceru, the third generation Epo, after Italians Riccardo Ricco and Leonard Piepoli and Germans Stefan Schumacher, and he from Gerolsteiner.
The results of Kohl blood samples are among those carried out in the last few weeks by Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the control analysis confirms the positivity of Ceru, Rakusan will lose third place on the Tour and will have to face the set two years of disqualification.
The report on Kohl’s positivity at the third-generation Epo confirms the head of the French anti-doping agency Pierre Bordry, who announced the Associated Press that he had already informed the Austrian government authorities about the results.
26-year-old Raku<0xC5><0xA1>an placed on the stage winners behind Spain's Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evansem, he also won the score of the best top player's shirt.
Immigrants: NEW YORK TIMES SHOULD, IS ITALY RASIST?
Italy "as a country of emigrants has only turned into a preferred target of immigrants in the last house" accepted with resistance.
It turns this beautiful country into a nation of racists? So draws in a long New York Times article, which devoted this article to the debate on racism in Italy, and began with the case of young Abdul William Guibre who originated from Burkina Faso, who was murdered last month in Mirá
This case shows what the New York Times defines as "the paradox of the north": the northern regions are at the same time those where "more integration and more work" is recorded, but also "the strongest anti-immigrant thinking in the country and the strongest support of the Northern League."
To confirm rising tensions between Italy and immigrants, NYT cited cases of intolerance from Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturna.
Not just that.
The new legislation required by Lego, which seeks to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants, is also cited as an example of climate change in Italy.
The Pope and the President of the Republic emphasized the trend: “Giorgio Napolitano, after meeting Benedict XVI in Quirinale, asked the state and the Church to work together to defeat racism.”
Students with victims of expensive rentals - up to 900 euros per room
The lease market for university students is not in crisis.
According to the latest research by Sunia, the departments for tenants, renting a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, in Florence 700, in Naples 650, in Rome 600.
“The fact that he has already reached such dimensions that entire classes of students have lost their right to study because of the overall too high prices their families would have to bear,” explains the head of the studio’s office, Laura Mariani, who is a resident of the Sunia Studios, who has been in the process.
In most cases, rental offers contain several violations: contracts free of charge, unregistered, without limited rental, and associated rentals.
For Sunji, there is a need for exceptional intervention that could regulate prices thanks to the tax revision.
If you look at the details of the research, you will see that in Milan, in the Brianza area, there is a need for a single bed about 450 euros, per single room is paid from the minimum price of 650 (zone Bande Nere) through the average value of 800 (zone Lambiate, Udine and Fiera) to the maximum of 9 (Vittoria).
In Florence one bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, one room about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in areas close to the university, it costs 250/280 euros per bed in a double room, from 370 to 500 euros in a single room.
In Rome, in the central university zones (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) they want about 600 euros for a single room, 450 beds in a double room.
The values are slightly lower (550 euros per single bed) in areas close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
We save only if we move to the peripheral areas: 300 euros for a bed and 450 for a single room in the zones of Prenestina, Centocelle and the like.
In Naples there are 300/450 euros for a bed, 400 to 600 euros for a room, with the highest prices in the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei zones.
In Bar they want 250/350 euros for a bed, at least 350 for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are definitely lower, but they have a greater impact on the economy of citizens.
In cities such as Perugia, where it is the most frequent phenomenon rented to students from countries outside the European Union, there is finally another anomaly: an increase of about 25-30% in the fee they want foreign students, compared to Italians.
Farewell to old cinema Paradiso, the city cancels historic halls
The cinematographic historical halls are closed for the benefit of Multiplex.
“A city without cinema is as blind as a face without eyes.”
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornator successfully documents what is happening in large Italian city centres, as well as rural towns.
The process of filming, the birth of large multisales in the suburbs and the subsequent disappearance of monosales in central urban areas is one of the events that seem inevitable and irreversible, but also has all the signs of real cultural crime.
“It’s like losing a friend, a friend, a friend, with whom we shared a piece of journey and a lot of emotion,” said New Cinema Paradiso, a film that was filmed twenty years ago, a life-time, a life-time, a life-time, an Oscar-winning film, and a grand prize.
The values obtained by Anec, the main association of operators, speak clearly: in the last five years, 316 cinemas of traditional type have closed their doors, and the highest bill has been paid primarily in the halls in the most important cities: about 10 mins in Florence, about 5 mins in Florence, about 6 mins in Bologna, about 9 mins in Papoli, about 9 mins in Milalog.
Among the regions most affected by lockdowns are Emilia-Romagna, with 82 cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And the evidence that the first responsible for their disappearance is the onset of multiplex, are these three Italian regions that have recorded the highest number of new cinema multisales: 195 more canvases in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian procedure has developed irrationally," says Paolo Protti, president of Anec, "it is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to guarantee that those already existing survive, because when one theater in the city closes, not all its visitors are willing to move into the multiplex.
Then let’s not even talk about insufficient funding to the fund for the benefit of operators: the previous state debt is about 10 million euros.
From a moral and ethical point of view, it is a shame that the government does not respect existing laws.
It would require between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16 million and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>18 million a year to support the sector.”
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city to have concerns with locks and which decided to find the starting point by signing a protocol between the municipalities and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy to protect and promote small cinemas both in the historical centers and in the suburbs.
Among the planned standards are steps of tax relief in favour of operators and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to fly into a zone with limited traffic and will have special prices to stop and in some car parks.
“I like this initiative,” says Giuseppe Tornatore, “and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by introducing other measures.”
However, it is certain that in order to be able to resist the great power of multiplex, traditional halls must improve the quality of sound and image, because today’s audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a subject that has always been important: the closure of the Super Cinema in Bagheria, instead of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to set up the "New Cinema Paradiso" that I have been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I walk in front of the already closed Rialto or Quirinale in Nazionale Street, where I have shared so much emotion that I don’t have to look at the inscriptions in black dust, I turn to the other side.”
Relationship between Politician and Mafia Group 'ndranghet, Mayor Gioie Tauro in Prison
"The mayor of Gioie Tauro was willing to adjust the city's elections according to the interests of the Piromalli Mafia group."
The charges brought by the Directorate against the Mafia in Calabria against Mayor Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione e Rosario Schiavone, and Mayor Rosarno Carlo Martel, imprisoned this morning for external cooperation with the Mafia organization.
Gioacchino Piromalli, an old mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson, a lawyer, the name of the boss, already accused of committing crimes of a mafia character, sentenced to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million.
"They ignored all legal and moral norms, as well as common sense," state prosecutors wrote, when two local governments expressed a willingness to pay the consultations to lawyer Piromallim.
“This would allow the Mafia group to officially enter the city authorities and facilitate the enormous possibilities of control and administration of the public administration,” the judges wrote.
The president of the Calabrian Regional Commission, Agazio Loiero, did not hide that "secret agreements between local institutions and the organized crime sub-world are many in his region: "There are areas in which the concentration of the mafia is stronger than in others where secret agreements are inevitable.
But we also have many local politicians who are resisting the pressures of 'dranghets, heroes who are still indifferent.'
The arrests from this morning follow the arrests from July last year, by which the police showed that the Piromalli Mafia group had received a final intervention.
Since the end of April last year - the Gioii Tauro City Council has been disbanded since 1991, the reason for even that time was the supposed link between organized crime and local government - local politicians were deprived of office in the municipal administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, the president of the Christian Democrats, who was elected head of the right-wing coalition at the time of the dissolution after a narrow election in May.
He shouted over the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the city council.
He called on Deputy Interior Minister Marc Minniti to account and accused him of concealing everything for political reasons, but judges in the arrest warrant signed this morning explain that the Mafia group has even reached a point where the project has been so far that it has asked for a change.
From further hearings ordered against Dal Torrion, the public prosecutor writes, it emerged "the willingness to move the claims of the entrepreneur, representatives of some larger group very close, as is generally known, Piromallim, and to adapt the choices of the public administration group."
When the energy is born from the waves, the big ones enter the game.
It is an infinite bearing that covers more than 70% of the earth’s surface and is now being discovered by major global energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides, outflows are new sources of inexhaustible energy that have been struck by the sight of colossals like Chevron, who is now trying to stretch out their hands on these sources.
The possibility of generating energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for more than a hundred years, and in the 1970s, in connection with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When oil prices declined around 1980, the idea of the use of marine energy went away. But now ecological organizations and a new increase in oil prices gave the sector a new impetus.
In 2007, the World Energy Council (WEC) in London said that about 15 percent of the world’s electricity consumption could be covered by the movement of sea waves.
that amount would be double the amount of energy that is currently produced in nuclear power plants.
In addition, there are currents and inflows and outflows.
The giants are attacking.
The company that invested in marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 agreed to build a facility in northern Portugal.
When this intention was announced, it looked like a huge revolutionary step.
After two years of investing in marine energy, more and more companies are investing in marine energy rather than traditional energy.
“Chevron is studying ocean energy technology,” said a spokesman for a company that is connected to the U.S. oil circle in the economic daily Wall Street Journal, “and they are thinking about working with us.”
The cooperation we are considering concerns obtaining permission from the U.S. Energy Commission, which is necessary for the launch of a project on the use of marine energy in Alaska.
We cannot underestimate this signal, especially given that it is in Alaska that the U.S. is still mining oil, and President Bush has recently come up with a new drilling plan.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey are tracking the trail of marine energy, and the amounts invested so far, although not known in detail, are showing increasing interest, according to observers.
Technology needs to be developed in a nutshell.
Experts are talking about the technology, which is still in the beginning, because they do not know what impact the use of marine energy will have on the environment.
For the time being, facilities in Portugal and some in Scotland are small and do not seem to cause major problems to the ecosystem.
However, more energy production requires the use of technology with a greater impact on the average.
The methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a fear system that is connected to each other.
The force of the wave, which moves with the battles up and down, is changed by means of cylinders and cylinders to the hydraulic pressure inside these battles.
The pressure rotates the turbine, which delivers energy to the generator.
Energy is obtained on the coast by submarine cables.
Currently, there are four such facilities in the project phase, awaiting only federal approval, and some of the energy could be used for military purposes.
On the contrary, Verdant Power is already generating energy for the shopping mall and parking lot using six submarine turbines in New York’s East River.
The movement of water during the influx and outflow causes the turbines to rotate, which are fed by this rotational movement by the generator.
Verdant stated that they have a long list of clients waiting for necessary authorization due to the possibility of using this energy.
After the waves, after the tide, and after the tide.
The potential of tide and tide is of particular interest at this moment, they say at the Institute for Electricity Research.
Although this is an independent factor, tide and outflow are more predictable than wind, sun, or waves, and thus more reliable as a source of energy.
Just in the energy of tide and tide states like New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal states have already invested <0x24>7 and a half million in 2008 and predicted investments of up to <0x24>35 million by 2009.
