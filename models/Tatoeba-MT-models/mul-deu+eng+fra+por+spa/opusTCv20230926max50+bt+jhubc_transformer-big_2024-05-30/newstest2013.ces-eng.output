Republican Party’s strategy against Obama’s re-election
Republican leaders have justified their policy of the necessity of combating electoral fraud.
The Brennan Center, however, labels such fraud a myth with the fact that election fraud is less common in the United States than the number of people who die after lightning strikes.
Republican lawyers have only recorded 300 cases of electoral fraud in the U.S. in the past decade.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on election participation.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. is responsible for organizing federal elections.
And in this spirit, the majority of U.S. governments have been enacting new laws since 2009 that make the process of election or registration difficult.
This phenomenon has been seen since the November 2010 election, during which 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states have joined.
As a result, only in 2011, 180 bills were submitted to restrict voting rights in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID and a U.S. citizenship document.
In addition, these laws limit the period for early elections, invalidate the right to register on the electorate on the day of the election and deprive citizens of the right to vote with a registration in the criminal register.
Before the 2006 election, no U.S. state was required to present a photo ID to voters.
The first state to introduce this requirement was Indiana.
The constitutionality of Indian law was confirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2008.
The Republican authorities hastened to extend this process to other states as well.
Over the past two years, bills like this have been endorsed in 34 states to force voters to submit photo IDs.
It should be noted that unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal identity card, such as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, i.e. 21 million people allowing age to vote, do not have a photo ID issued by the government office of their state.
Furthermore, he does not have such an identity card of about five million new voters in 2012.
In addition, obtaining the required ID often costs more than a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions are disproportionately affecting mainly young people, members of minorities and low-income people.
25% of African Americans, 15% of people with income below <0x24>35,000; 18% of citizens aged 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 therefore do not have the required photo ID.
And that's not all.
Students who are known as voters for their affection for democratic candidates are not allowed in several states to use their identity card with a photo issued by their school.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of hunting or fishing clubs who vote for Republican candidates to use cards issued by these clubs in the elections.
Until 2004, no state required a certificate of citizenship in the elections.
The first such request was introduced by Arizona.
Since 2011, about twelve states have passed laws that stipulate the duty of voters to prove that they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the number of votes from the Spanish minority.
It should be noted that two out of three Hispanics prefer the democratic party.
In 2011, Republican lawmakers endorsed laws in eight states that cancel voter registration on election day.
In addition, they have restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters who want to register.
These limitations have their consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general elections, the campaign to register voters contributed to the registration of about 10 million people.
The measures taken after 2009, however, caused a 17% decline in the registration of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
Republican lawmakers then passed laws in five other states aimed at shortening the period for early elections.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, African Americans accounted for 33% of the voters who voted in advance, although African American voters in this country were only 13%.
It was the same for the Spaniards.
They constituted only 11% of all voters, but 24% of citizens voting in advance.
On the other hand, whites, who accounted for 76% of all voters, accounted for only 46% of voters who voted in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters were very strongly opposed to the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
The Democratic governors blocked a number of bills with their veto.
In order to suspend the validity of the most controversial laws, the Attorney General of the United States even intervened.
Some of the damage was reduced in part.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have adopted laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
However, the newly introduced rules will undoubtedly hinder the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democrat critics talk primarily about the preemptiveness of the laws passed and consider them an obvious attempt to influence the results of the 2012 elections in key states.
The Brennan Center’s 2011 report shows that the states where these laws were passed represent 171 of the 270 votes in the electorate needed to win the presidential election.
It is too early to declare with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
But one thing is certain today: these new provisions will have a negative impact on electoral participation.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Detection of prostate cancer: to undergo an examination or not?
The PSA test resulted in flaws that were incorrectly negative or even incorrectly positive, leading to unnecessary medical interventions.
All this even increased the hesitation of the men who were already so reluctant to go to the examination at all.
To be investigated or not?
We asked for the opinion of two experts.
Studies conducted in the U.S. showed a high rate of contamination between the individual groups tested, so it is difficult to interpret these results and make valuable recommendations.
Another study, this time European, found a different mortality rate between patients undergoing the examination and those who did not.
The study also showed that those who did not go to the examination had a 30 to 40 percent higher risk of metastasis.
Therefore, I recommend an examination from the age of 50 or from the age of 40 if your immediate relative had prostate cancer.
The group is also more vulnerable to men of African-American descent.
The key is to make the right decision once the cancer is discovered.
There are aggressive types of cancer and such types that are ineffective.
Therefore, it is necessary to correctly explain to the patient the degree of danger of his type of cancer, to offer him possible alternatives, not necessarily treat prostate cancer, which does not have a long-term impact on life, and to focus in these cases rather on active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not being treated because their type of cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
Instead, we suggest active surveillance and offer treatment in the event of progression of the disease.
Increasingly and more accurately, we set criteria that help in deciding which type to treat and which not.
However, I recommend that you complete the exam.
However, it is important to have an interview with a doctor and determine whether it is appropriate to undergo an examination or not.
In cooperation with the International Urological Society, Movember has developed a tool that allows for and against evaluation in connection with the PSA examination.

Prevention of diseases
Unfortunately, there is no miracle procedure for preventing cancer.
Despite progress in research, it seems to be the best way to reduce disease risk of adopting healthy lifestyle principles.
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and exercised enough, up to 30% of cancer cases could be prevented.
“If everyone stopped smoking, this figure would rise to at least 50%,” said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Research Society.
In contrast, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers cause heredity.
Some percentages remain completely unexplained as well.
For the Canadian Cancer Research Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, even though the number of smokers is declining.
Cigarettes cost 85% of lung cancer cases.
They are also a risk factor for several others.
This is extremely detrimental to human health.
"There are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today," spokesman André Beaulieu said.
Stimulating data: 10 years after a smoker quits, the risk of death from cancer decreases by half.
Weight(s)
Fitness and obesity are another risk factor for the occurrence of the disease, according to the SCC.
They increase the risk of breast, colon and rectum cancer, intestine, pancreas and uterus.
“Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer,” the report adds.
Nutrition
The organisation also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
With too high consumption, it can lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is also advisable to avoid bugs for which the same applies.
Preservation of meat by boiling, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
“They can cause damage to the body’s cells and lead to the development of cancer,” the report adds.
Vitamins
Recently, various scientists have focused on the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, research has not yet reached unambiguous conclusions.
Studies focused on vitamin E are contradictory according to the SCC.
Although one of them says there is a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another study talks about its increase.
Nor is the effect of vitamin D on cancer unambiguously demonstrated.
Mr. Beaulieu further insists on how important it is to talk about his concerns and family precedents with his doctor.
"To undergo an examination doesn't mean you're going to have cancer."
Higgs boson explored
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson triggered a legitimate launch last summer.
There is an opinion that this boson is involved in a mechanism that is responsible for all the matter in the universe.
And furthermore, it is the last particle whose existence is predicted by a standard model – our best or “at least bad” explanation of the nature and behavior of matter – which has not yet been empirically observed.
However, physicists still don't have a 100% certainty that it's a Higgs boson.
There is no doubt that we have a completely new particle available, which is very similar to the Higgs boson, as predicted by the standard model.
The new data released this week during the big physical congress in Kyoto confirms it, but all the data are still missing so that we can have absolute certainty.
However, let's assume it's a Higgs boson, because the risk of error seems small, and let's look at what it's actually about.
In this world there is an indisputable law, according to which two things cannot occur at the same time in the same place.
This rule cannot be circumvented - and don't try too hard, otherwise you'll hurt yourself.
Although particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that a similar law applies to it: Paul's principle of excretion, according to which two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "status" is roughly excreted from some point of view.
Physical particles are divided into two categories.
On the one hand, we find organized citizens, or firms, who obey Paul’s principle.
And on the other hand, bosons are moving, according to anarchists, who do not value anything at all - certainly not this principle, which means that they can be quietly in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are further divided into two groups by device (by the way, absolutely amazing), which is The Particle Adventure, in the Berkeley laboratories: the mesons that we leave unnoticed here, and the "power particles" by which the great natural forces are spread and with which the bosons are connected.
However, it must be said that these bosons are not as exotic animals as you might think.
If you read this article, it is thanks to a boson with an unusual banality: a photon, or "particles of light", which is the "carrier" of electromagnetic force.
When particles with an electric charge accelerate or change their direction, they "disrupt" the electromagnetic field in this particular place, similar to a shell thrown into the pond.
This "disruption" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave is nothing more than a photon - and thus one of the bosons, "bearers of force".
A more stable field
The same is true with the Higgs boson, only with the difference that "disturbing" is necessary another field, the Higgs field to make this boson appear.
This Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, very high energy values need to be achieved, just like the frozen level of the pond, already only a very large balloon burns.
For this reason, it is necessary to use such a huge part accelerator as an accelerator in the CERN lab - a large hadron accelerator with interlocking bands is a circle with a circumference of 27 km! - in order to develop such energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field again fits us to clarify the relationship between Higgs and matter.
With the electromagnetic field, neither all particles nor all materials react.
Some, for example, magnets, do, but others do not - for example, a piece of paper will never keep itself in the refrigerator.
And the same goes for the fact that not all particles react with the Higgs field: those who do have a certain mass, while others (such as photons, let's look at it) do not.
And Mrs. Novak asks, what is all this research about, what will it "bring to us"?
From a scientific point of view, this is a confirmation of the validity of the standard model (SM), which allows physicists to investigate any discrepancies between the observation and prediction of SM.
In addition, few physicists literally want to be able to find them, because the slightest difference could open up the space of "new physics" and correct some gaps in the model.
It should be noted that the model still has huge shortcomings, does not bring any clarification of gravity (ouha!) or dark matter, which make up about 80% of the space mass (again ouha!).
However, CERN has not yet found such contradictions.
Responsibilities
The responses of these researches in Mr. and Mrs. Novak's everyday life can only be very difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to think that there will be none.
At the very beginning of the 1960s, the laser pioneers in Bell’s laboratories had no idea of the revolution that would trigger their work.
They assumed scientific use, but nothing else.
The physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who created the first permanent laser beam (previous beams were pulsed) in 1962, I have already said - the laser was initially considered to be such a "play".
Just imagine it...
And in addition, the application can also derive from all the tools that surround research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle created a small light sensor in 1969 during his work focused on optics.
This sensor, although Boyle did not initially plan it at all, now serves as the "eye" of all digital cameras in the world and won him the Nobel Prize in physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities around LHC need to change our lives, but it means that a person never really knows...
Palliative care - The best way to get out of life... <0x7C> Le Devoir
Through his Commission on the Dignity of Death, Quebec has recently taken part in the painful question of the end of life.
The debate should continue soon, and at the same time a bill is being drafted.
There is still a lot of work to be done in this crucial area.
Le Devoir magazine has tried to look at this question in more detail.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that fed her gave him a two-year delay.
"They gave me five years of my life, and it's seven," she says, without emotion on her bed at the palliative care home Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where she arrived the day before.
"But it's still a shock, you can't prepare for that," he adds.
The disease has done its job: an immense weakness makes it impossible for him to take himself to the toilet or just eat himself.
Resignedly, he looks at a tasty breakfast and agrees that we will help him eat.
He's brave and even smiling, talking to strangers who stop at him, bringing him medicines, offering him a bath.
Courage to an ordinary death.
"My biggest wish is to get rid of that diarrhea, it humiliates me," he confides.
A few hours later, a team of doctors found a cure for his problem.
“A lifetime of learning that men urinate,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois facility.
Returning to the child stage is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
“It depends on the abilities of the person,” the psychologist says.
In the opinion of a number of people dealing with palliative care, the crucial moments take place at the very heart of such a return.
Patients who come home with Victor-Gadbois palliative care all suffer from cancer.
Their prognosis is a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses who take care of them does not provide so-called "treatment" care.
In the case of Mrs. A., aged 89, the worst fear is to die "of suffocation in full consciousness".
The disease allowed me to discover my children.
"I have good kids," she adds.
"I don't have any desire in my life anymore," she says, and then she lets us put her breathing apparatus on.
However, he is still looking forward to the last visit of his son from Italy in the coming days.
In the Victor-Gadbois home, in collaboration with a group of volunteers, body care is provided with nutrition.
This is what palliative care looks like, if nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is one palliative care bed per 11,700 inhabitants.
That's very little if we realize that we're all going to die one day.
Here life continues in optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the home.
Whether it’s a level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When a person dies, they can be given, for example, a brandy or pepsi, according to taste.
Diabetics no longer need to monitor their sugar levels.
Death is a part of everyday life.
They brought Mr. X's beer last night, who died later in the night.
This morning his son is drinking beer in honor of his deceased father.
“We are helping patients as well as their loved ones,” says Nathalie Savard, director of care services.
In the house of Victor-Gadbois, they go for days, but they don't like each other.
Alongside the thirty-nine-year-old man, who enjoys his last encounter with his family thoroughly pawned by pillows, while he is sued for his honor, tragically dies a thirty-six-year-old man surrounded by all his parents, his wife, and two little children.
“For half a year there have always been three to five beds designed for people with cancer under 45,” says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who come to Victor-Gadbois’ home come from their homes and 47% from hospitals.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care that is designed to alleviate suffering as soon as the patient reaches the final stage of their life, whether it is at home, in a hospital, or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois home and the Grand Montréal Home Palliative Treatment Company, are more or less exclusively specialized in the care of oncological patients.
And it is this fundamental inaccessibility of health care in Quebec that leads to a number of doctors specializing in palliative care fearing the adoption of a law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, the manifesto has been signed in circulation by top-ranked palliative treatments, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, in which they show their disagreement with such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not powerful enough to provide access to quality palliative care for all people until it is possible to agree to euthanasia.
As she says, she recently experienced a patient who spent 14 days in the emergency room in huge pain, without anyone taking the necessary steps to relieve her.
He fears that patients will not be asked to be executed because they do not receive adequate care.
And at the same time, many oncologists take care of their patients until the last minute, regardless of the unfavorable prognosis.
The hopes of Hélène Richard's survival were already quite minimal when she left her demanding chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping treatment, she said she regretted that I was stopping fighting, she told us.
And then she told me it was over!
There is no omnipotent care
Dr. Martel estimates that 90% of the patients who wish to die thank their nursing doctors for not fulfilling their wishes when the palliative baking team eased their pain.
However, it should be said that palliative care is definitely not all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Grand Montreal Home Palliative Care Company, patients are prevented from treating pain in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often use a palliative sedative, which the patient sleeps until the moment of the end, whether severely or permanently given sedative.
We cannot pretend that we do not perceive this part of suffering.
A patient who does not get rid of pain will have an ever-increasing chance of access to palliative sedative.
Patients who are not given a sedative always say the same thing: “I want to die.”
But that doesn’t necessarily mean “I want you to give me euthanasia,” it means rather “I want you to get rid of my pain.”

Extensive Real Estate Scandals in Quebec
Travel administration officials, entrepreneurs in construction and public works, lobbyists of political parties and experts in the Italian mafia are still telling what they know about the amazing "system" in which construction workers, civil servants, politicians, and trade unionists mix.
This "sector" came very expensive to Quebec taxpayers, especially between 1990 and 2000.
“It’s interesting how the system has split since we took the fundamental measures,” said Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former Montreal police chief.
This resulted in a 2011 scandal on the basis of a consistent investigation into the abuse of funds in connection with the Quebec road construction contracts, which the then liberal Quebec Prime Minister Jean Charest approved only after long delays.
Duchesneau’s report confirmed the direct link between industry, opaque party funding and corruption of state officials.
"Already since the start of the investigation in 2010," she says, "only the Department of Transportation saved billion dollars on contracts," when some people kept their instincts on the brink of gaining a share of them!
The Charbonneau Commission "has led to the resignation of two mayors," he added in the hopes that it will succeed in "disclosing the innocence of some people".
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit Established in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit, founded in 2011, is also engaged in the fight with its army of government inspectors, investigators and analysts.
The "Marteau family" police officers, who have been ensuring since 2009 that the Montreal "money-guide cartel" significantly mitigates the inflation of orders...
In recent weeks, they have conducted a number of inspections and have accused a number of municipal representatives of fraud and corruption, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of one of the suburbs.
The next on the list is Gilles Villancourt, who has just stepped down as mayor of Laval, the third largest city in Quebec.
He is suspected of repeatedly accepting fees in exchange for public procurement.
The formal charges were also received by Montreal transport engineers and entrepreneurs of Italian descent, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
Lino Zambito sparked sensation by explaining to the commission the mechanism of the "system" of procurement.
During these years, he devoted 3% of the value of the contracts he received in Montreal to a mediator associated with the mafia, who then transferred the money to the Union Montreal party, for which Mayor Gérald Tremblay was nominated.
After 2000, Zambito was generous to all parties and donated more than <0x24>88,000 (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>68,000) to provincial parties, but especially to liberals who were in power at the time.
He also admitted to organizing an illegal fundraising for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Contracts with money lines, the prices of which were higher
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption was very chile.
Gilles Surprenant, a former transport engineer, described it in great detail before the commission: over the course of ten years he received gifts from construction companies, invitations to tours, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and pockets worth a total of <0x24>736,000 in exchange.
Other public officials in the transport sector admitted that they were allowed to pay rewards for overestimating invoices by 30% to 40% through false multiplexing.
Martin Dumont, the party's mayor, then accused Tremblay of staring at the concurrent budget, which brought dirty money into his treasury, without despair.
Based on these revelations, Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a massive crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first Montreal MPs to issue a warning signal.
As the mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district in the east of the island, since 2010, it has been against the sale of municipal property purchased for <0x24>5 million and sold for <0x24>1.6 million to promoters right in the middle of a flourishing real estate trade.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
The inquiry, which will finally be launched, says it "is hiding behind the threads in an effort to understand the functioning of the system of the promoted ants to stop gangrene and charge the culprits".
The process is “painful, but positive.”
We are in the stage of wound cleansing, but it is necessary to set up our own investigative unit in Montreal and ensure surveillance so that these dubious practices cannot return.
It's like cleaning up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "public officials have withdrawn hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is particularly concerned about the roles of "deputies informed about this issue" if they have not entered into these chakras!
He estimates that 70% of the funding for election campaigns in Quebec comes from dirty money, and ironically adds, "I heard it's just a weak distortion of reality."
The Quebec government is proposing to limit donations to parties to <0x24>100, but he says it will not solve the situation: "Until election spending is strictly limited, dirty money will not disappear from politics."
He proposes a comprehensive check on the system of public procurement and financing of the parties: "We can no longer fall; if we courageously focus on the essence of things, we can rebuild on more solid foundations and with more control and law enforcement."
If this story paints a picture of Quebec and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau recommends everyone who laughs at him to look at his own yard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
You and PSG have set a whole new pace this season.
How do you explain this development?
It can be explained by the fact that all the individuals have gone into each other, or by a completely new PSG dimension.
Great players have come to us.
I get along with them every day.
The technical team has helped me a lot.
Every day, these facts allow me to increase the level of play.
And in games it's easier.
In football, everything goes really fast.
I'm not losing my head.
From my beginnings in the preparation at INF Clairefontaine until my move to Saint-Etienne, I have always been moving in individual degrees.
So you are using the competitive environment introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
Poses of this summer are used to playing games at a very high level.
They also know that every training is essential.
And it turns out that a player like me then has a greater taste for the game and wants to give maximum performance.
And besides, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my position.
He has assistants like Claude Makelele, who played on the same post as me.
Does Ancelotti have a decisive word at the right time?
Of course I do.
Ancelotti respects all technicians.
Today, he is not equal in the 1st league and is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has a lot of experience and has won a lot of titles with top teams.
He also worked with excellent players.
I think he will win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had a calming conversation with him.
I've had a lot of injuries.
The trust he gives me is another reason for my performance.
What do you think of the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took a leading position.
But we're still in the curtain.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we moved very easily to the eighth round.
What is the goal of your club in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as possible.
Anything can happen now.
But we certainly want to be a tough opponent for quality European teams.
We want to first win our qualifying team in front of the Port so we can play in the rematch in the eighth final at home.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
The budget already has...
To become a great European club, Paris must win titles and enter history.
That's not the case today.
On the financial side, PSG has the means to achieve this goal.
And would it be a big failure not to win in the 1st Ligue like last season?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
We really want to win a league title this year.
We missed him a lot last season.
In May, we were disappointed because we had to win.
We had a great season.
We scored 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, you are a clear master...
But another club, Montpellier, had an even more amazing season.
I think it will be done this year.
“Although great teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are trying to win the title, I think we have the weapons available to defeat them.
Do you think the media expect too much from PSG?
It is not uncommon to expect a lot from us given what we have invested here and what players we have.
We totally accept that.
The fact is, if we beat Troyes 4:0 at home and there's still something they're reading in the newspapers, it's not very pleasant.
You ask yourself what other people may want more of you.
Of course, you won’t win 4:0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona.
We're trying to set up a game style.
You need time to build a team.
In the Champions League, we were able to play.
Take a look at Manchester City, who didn’t break into the finals for the second season, while also investing big amounts!
Given the invested amounts, you could expect to have a jump ahead of the other 15 points!
You are insulting the other clubs and the French League.
The clubs of Lyon and Marseille, which failed too much last season, moved to the next stage with the new PSG.
This shows how great the 1st league is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and say that despite all the difficulties we have succeeded in winning.
PSG seems to have relied on the performance of Zlatana Ibrahimovic.
It is good to say that there is "addiction to Zlatan".
This means that Ibrahimovic is very powerful and gives a lot of goals.
That's why he came here to prove he's a league 1 star.
Wherever he went, he proved to be a great player, a world star.
In our team, we respect both the people and the players.
He also respects the people around him.
What he has achieved is truly exceptional.
This also led others to increase their own level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows others to grow alongside him.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French team?
As a disappointment.
I really wanted to play in this tournament.
Unfortunately, due to the injury, I couldn’t play the way I imagined.
But I experienced it and got out of it stronger.
I’m also able to play good games in the team today.
That’s what I’ve been hoping for since I joined the team.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe ourselves to make our speeches exemplary.
How do you look at the first month of Didier Deschamps at the head of the national team?
The results speak for him.
In qualifying for MS, we are in a good place.
The coach chooses strictly, is close to the players and can inspire for victory.
And so was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to compare them.
Blanc achieved his goal by qualifying for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps brings our team to Brazil.
Is the rematch (1:1) of October 16 in Spain a solid starting match?
This game has given us confidence.
We all fought for the team.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never experienced such a match in my career.
With Bitcoin, you can pay and sell without a bank
All negatives of current financial transactions based on central banks, identified transactions and processing costs between recipients.
In addition, as is often the case in these technologies, there is a clear political outlook: the belief that the existing financial system built on banking monopolies leads to financial crises.
Bitcoin, whose inventor is Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), represents both virtual money (transferable to dollars, euros...), and a secure transfer protocol similar to BitTorrent, which allows file exchange between two partners.
Thanks to 15,000 computers connected to the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been registered.
About a thousand websites are already accepting bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The bitcoin exchange rate first reached a peak of <0x24>30 (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>23) in June 2011, five months later fell to <0x24>2, today moving at the border of about <0x24>10 (the exchange rate overview is listed on bitcoincharts.com).
Compared to the world's real money exchange or financial products, this is nothing impressive.
And yet the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this fact in its report on virtual finance, which was released in October.
Bitcoin calls it “the most unsuccessful virtual money,” “the competing dollar and the euro,” and “the period of ordinary money.”
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual money in that it’s like “credits” used for the procedure in a video game that a person acquires with a game or can buy (and exchange back and forth).
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
However, each month, the central authority shall check and process individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoin, all nodes networks are regular account book depositors, inspectors, money issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Any transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses via e-mail.
However, the user can choose a different address for each payment, thereby ensuring anonymity.
A file of information related to this transaction is electronically signed by a dual-key encryption system.
This way, the network can verify the legitimacy of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins exist in the public book of ordinary accounts, which is distributed throughout the network.
The key phase is the registration of this new transaction in this book.
It is carried out by solving a mathematical task assigned to computers, whose solver, such as a temporary central banker, will have the right to write this additional line.
This is the cutting phase of a file; i.e. the transformation of a huge file into a shorter and unique digital print.
Computers "take over" this new transaction and add a number to it, only then the whole "cut off".
The goal is to find a number that provides a specific print (deserving zero at the beginning).
Once this number is found, other nodes will easily check its accuracy.
The transaction will then appear indestructiblely connected to the chain of all other transactions; any edit would change the print.
If the user wants to pay twice the same money in a row (up to ten minutes), the network will only confirm one of the two transactions - the other will be abandoned, because each of them has a different print.
The computer that solves the challenge will win 50 bitcoins.
In order to avoid inflation, this reward is regularly divided into two, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is so limited by the number of 21 million, but they can be divided up to a stallion, so there is room for margins here.
The difficulty of the given task also increases with the increasing level of calculation.
The network has experienced its rises and falls.
Websites that provide services for Bitcoin have been attacked and the stored bitcoins have been hijacked.
“The used case does not concern the protocol itself,” assures Pierre Noizat, who founded Paymium, a real-money payments company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also checks the possibility of money laundering with this anonymous service.
But this problem also applies to cash.
Major players like Wikipedia reject the gifts of this nature.
Others, like WordPress blogging platforms, accept them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel recently analyzed the book of ordinary accounts and proved that almost 80% of bitcoins are not running.
In November, a “great discount” was launched.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who deals with converting bitcoins into gold, says.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of the pedagogical book on this money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless mobile payment, but uses the Bitcoin system to verify transactions that are therefore cheaper.
In addition, the carrier manages its identity and can thus remain anonymous.
The system is easily set up for traders where new terminals or software are not required to be installed.
It’s enough to provide an address that can be “photographed and recognized by the phone,” says Pierre Noizat, who ensures that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to question hierarchical systems and the transition to more horizontal systems.
“Before Bitcoin is implemented, it will take a while, but 2013 could be decisive,” he predicted.
In addition, the ECB envisages in its report a reassessment of the various risks that are now considered to be increased if this type of money is successful.
We're leaving Afghanistan.
What's next?
The French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapis and Surobi).
NATO and U.S. forces are expected to follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take control of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their own future and not expect everything from us.
The people in the Afghan countryside who were punished for being considered terrorists suffered the greatest damage.
And we, too, have lost 88 soldiers killed, and all those wounded and frozen.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who fled to Pakistan, but they are often peasants who deny the presence of foreign armies as in Soviet times.
They only want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even though they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
They are now experiencing tolerance and frequent help from local insurgents, but if the Western forces withdraw, their support will decline.
The departure of the French troops from the base of the Nijrab, which I watched from the tops of the mountains planted by almonds thanks to French loans, was arranged.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles arrived in Kabul without airstrikes from helicopters.
Since the end of 2014, the Taliban will no longer be so active in Kabul.
The conditions have changed considerably since their insuperable course in 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was empty at the time, and the land was in blood and fire as a result of fighting between different resistance groups.
Their taking control of the country was then considered to be a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price for the darkness of these peasants, who were completely controlled by al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved to this day.
The former Mujahideen, the Afghan government and the present-day Taliban agree to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main critics of the war against Soviet troops returned to power in 2001.
They became craftsmen, acquired state land, sold as construction land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and used huge U.S. contracts for subcontractors.
They were discredited; in addition, most of them were never even in the fight.
According to what I've heard in the campaigns, people want a government that won't be made up of thieves.
A number of young people want to leave the way they want those who were able to take advantage of American generosity: capital leakage is significant.
Young people are already tired of war and ideologies associated with it.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they got to know the modern world and its advantages attracted them.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul currently has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
State schools are full in the cities, there are girls and boys.
These young people will have to be given a job, they no longer want to go back to the darkness of the former parties or to the corruption of some representatives.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, likes mobile phones; TV and Turkish TV shows that show the modern world are watching everywhere.
The army is already present.
Will the authorities that stand in front of her be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the fight against the Soviet army are already renewing provincial militias that will be out of control of the central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with a strong local identity influence, should enjoy some degree of decentralization in the Western model, but the US wanted to turn it into a centralized state with a strong presidential influence, so the post of prime minister, which had existed since the 19th century, was abolished.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially on the occasion of elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been heavily dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and earlier.
No industry has succeeded in restoring, no partition is working, no essential irrigation system is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
Privilege is a private initiative.
In a country devastated by three decades of war, governmental control of infrastructure would be necessary.
There are rumors that Afghanistan has a huge, inexhaustible wealth.
And it just gave me the feeling that the Western states were here just to take control of it.
Without energy to process iron ore or copper on the ground and without means of transporting raw materials through the mountains, no mining can take place.
The Chinese have almost left the copper mine Mes Aynak and have given international archaeological teams (with the support of the World Bank) the opportunity to explore a vast Buddhist site to retain the role of the most important employer in the entire province.
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which a large proportion of imports and exports depend, to re-establish normal relations.
The departure of the French combat units was completed on November 20.
The new Co-operation Treaty envisages the continuation of common types of aid: girls' and boys' lycées, departments of French at universities, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural fields, support for archaeological delegations.
Since 2009, the initiative "to gain heart and soul" has been in operation, trying to reconcile the difficult task of aid and military activities, in which the service of "civil-military steps" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was cancelled in 2012, was not organised in France.
This work, which involved a large number of local workers, helped to calm the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, forestry, fruit trees, soil protection and extension of cultivation area.
What memory will we leave behind after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to improving local living conditions, which are very demanding in these areas, which are often located at altitudes above 2,000 m.
The embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural aid from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order to free themselves from the insurrections led by foreign groups, these farmers wish, in their words, to obtain inappropriate civil assistance in their favour, which would be properly controlled and touched directly on them.
Difficult work on the Egyptian Constitution
President Mohammad Mursi went to another game of poker.
While Egypt remains the most divided in its history due to a constitution that temporarily grants it unlimited powers, it has decided to play a bargain.
On Wednesday, he announced, regardless of the opinion of all others, that the Constituent Assembly would come to approve the final text.
Less than a week ago, the head of state granted this assembly another two months to complete the necessary work.
For almost two years, Egypt has been using the provisional text, which has been supplemented many times, which weakens the country’s constitutional stability and leads to legal agreements.
This new initiative only further reinforced the country’s fragmentation.
From the point of view of the opposition, the president remains in his "autocratic deliry", continuing to "broke his word" and "slapping the right".
His supporters, however, ensure that it is a means to tackle the constitutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to accelerate the transitional process.
A referendum should be held in two weeks.
It is a very short period of time that will force the Brotherhood to withdraw from the intention of texting the Egyptians to clarify article by article.
It is also a way for the president to regain national and democratic legitimacy, while the whole country rejects protests.
As confirmed in an interview for the American weekly Time, Muhammad Mursi appears to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote for.
Particularly because this fast-paced vote puts the Egyptian people before the ultimatum: "Either you approve my text, or I will leave unlimited powers" which would otherwise end after the new constitution is approved.
And in this special atmosphere yesterday, 85 members of the aforementioned Constituent Assembly, with a large majority of Islamists, approved the text.
Most of the liberals were missing in the vote.
In mid-November, shortly before the proclamation of the constitution, they knocked on the door with no opportunity to enforce their views.
Human rights defenders, civil society or members of religious minorities imitated their move.
In order to achieve tolerance, 11 people from the ranks of substitutes were quickly supplemented yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is no surprise that the articles of the Constitution were often voted unanimously.
The commentators further stood over the fact that one of the few controversies turned around that day... the hour of prayer, when some members of the committee held the view that the hours in the meeting room were not properly arranged.
The text, which was voted last night, consists of 234 articles.
The subject of general attention, Article 2, remains in line with the 1971 Constitution and states that "the principles of Sharia law are the main source of law".
Salafist parties, for whom the introduction of Islamic law is one of the fundamental requirements, hoped to replace the term "principle" with the term "rule", which would allow for more stringent application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been corrected is a sign of their goodwill and respect for the other parts of Egyptian society.
"Hypocritism" is opposed by liberals, who see only a speech problem in this.
According to them, the islamization of the constitution takes place through other articles.
They focus in particular on Article 220, which entrusts al-Azhar University with an advisory role, in particular on issues of checking compliance with Sharia law.
According to Egypt expert Sophie Pommier, this is disturbing because "people called to express themselves are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
We can see the beginnings of theocracy.”
The concerns of liberals are even more frustrating that the next rector of the university should be less moderate than the current.
“At the moment, no specific religious consequences have emerged.
With this constitution, Egypt remains a framework civil state.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not scumbags, but university workers, many of whom have graduated from French schools,” said Alexis Blouet, who is preparing work on the constitutional transition in Egypt.
However, they agree that "there may be controversy regarding the interpretation of Article 220, because the terms used in it belong to the religious dictionary.
There is, in particular, a reference to "fiqh" [Islamic legal science, ed.].
And in the future, there may be a question of the extent to which civil judges are competent to express themselves.”
The text approved yesterday is highly criticized, in addition to the religious sides, for the extended powers that it confers on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood insists that there has been a significant restriction on them against the former regime.
Another controversial place: the powers entrusted to the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the representatives of the army, the verification of the defence budget will not be carried out by the parliament, but by the National Defense Council.
Furthermore, the trials of civilians in military courts will not be prohibited, as required by the human rights association.
These associations speak about their doubts in connection with the text they believe is directed against freedom.
The criminal act of slander is retained and the offense is still prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially then for the press.
In addition, no article is about the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture referred to in Article 36.
This word was not mentioned in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president was scheduled to perform in a televised speech last night, demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
The president’s supporters will be demonstrating on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places, the world’s beak and the sea from a saturated salt solution
The promised land combines the greatness of Bible truths, modern comfort and the untoldness of nature.
AaF has identified the five most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
Worshiping the Sacred Places
To visit the Jordan River, in which Jesus was baptized.
It is claimed that God’s mercy will come down on all who enter into this “rage.”
And Galilee - the place of Jesus' miracles: the conversion of water into wine at the wedding, walking on the water, calming the storm and filling the nets.
Here, too, Jesus appeared to his disciples and after the resurrection.
But most of the holy places are in Jerusalem.
Believers pass the Way of Pain or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (Latin Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the fortress of Antonia - Pretoria - where the trial took place, passes through the streets of the Old Town and leads to the Temple of the Grave on Mount Golgotha - to the place of crucifixion, to the stone of anointing, and to the place where Jesus was buried.
Here is the symbolic Christian puppet of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of humanity.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was built on the site where, according to Christian legend, a tree grew from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
Jerusalem also has the most sacred place for the Jews - the Wall of the Archangels, the rest of the temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
According to the tradition, people of different confessions here leave records with wishes that will then be fulfilled.
Making a journey through the vertical
The ruins of the fortress of Masada remained from a secret hiding place from the enemy, which Herod the Great built in 25 BC for his family.
The ruins are located on the hills in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
Only those who are involved in mountaineering can reach it by their own strengths.
The rest will be driven to this historic mountain by a cable car.
And in the north of the country, at an altitude of 1600-2040 m, there is the famous ski resort Hermon, which experiences a huge influx of tourists in the winter months.
To this ski paradise, tourists are transported from the foothills of the hill by a skating bus.
The total length of the mountain slopes is 45 km.
According to ancient legends, pagan gods were supposed to live on the top of the mountain.
Visiting Unique Museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You can’t visit all of them during one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are definitely worth a visit.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, which is located near the Knesset (parliament).
It contains ancient Kumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea scrolls, which were found in the caves of the Jewish desert, and also some 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
In his exhibition, his canvases are widely represented by impressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Akkon you can visit the Al Basha museum-course, which presents to visitors several rooms of ancient Turkish baths with figures of spa users and spa nurses from that time.
In Cesarea is worth a visit to the unique private Rally Museum, where you can admire the statues of Dalí and Roden.
There's no guides or memorials here.
Admissions are free and donations are strictly refused.
The Fifth Museum – the Museum of the Holocaust or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv – tells of one of the most dramatic sites in history.
The most tragic part of the museum – the Children’s Memorial – was built to commemorate 1.5 million children who were killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You will come in - and you will find yourself in complete darkness.
The stars are flickering.
And the names of the children of the Jews and the names of the lands in which they died shall sound.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Improving Your Health
The three main spa resorts of Israel are located on the coast of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Sea.
Each of them offers swimming pools, water parks, dolphinarium and oceanarium.
It is interesting that in the Red Sea you can bathe even in the winter months, because the water temperature in it does not fall below 21 degrees Celsius and the air warms up to 23 degrees Celsius.
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and people bathe in it all year round.
By the way, the Dead Sea is the most peculiar sea in the world, it is located at the lowest mainland point on the planet - at 417 m below sea level.
The azure water in it is a saturated salt solution, which easily keeps people at a level that cannot swim.
The surrounding landscape is unrealistically beautiful.
Come here to undergo treatment with the use of salt water - sausages, and medicinal mud, which can treat health problems with dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, pneumonia, diabetes, to cure your broken nerves.
Touch the Mysterious Past
It is protected by the ancient part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through them passed the famous sea route connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The mentions of this city can be found in the oldest Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it is the place where Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with which they lived a long and happy life together.
Tourists really love the slopes of the Uzuka streets, named after the signs of the zodiac.
It is said that if you push yourself to the walls in the street of "your" sign, your luck will be positively inclined.
In Jaffa, you may meet newlyweds who come here from all over Israel and even from other countries to take pictures.
And in Caesaria - in the city of King Herod - you can walk through the Roman theater and "get" the fortress of the crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the seat of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully reconstructed theater is used today for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourists, for vocabulary
If you’re going to Israel, you don’t have to worry about your imperfect English: in this country about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
On the way, it is better to take money with you not in euros, but in dollars that you can easily exchange for shekels (now <0x24>1 is about 3.8 shekels).
Urban transport is mainly buses, but in Jerusalem there is a high-speed tram and in Haifa there is the only metro line in the country with six stations that connects the lower city with the upper city.
This is basically an underground cable car.
Travelling through all types of urban public transport costs 6 shekels, for which you can drive with a change of seat for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on the Sabbath.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, it stops working in markets, shops and public transport.
And on Sunday morning, the week of work begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels you will only get a basket of food: except for pork, seafood, fish without squash and meals that contain a combination of milk and meat.
They offer a large selection of dishes from lamb and beef, soups and desserts, prepared from coconut milk, traditional Jewish hummus cheese, various types of sauces, balls from ground cider - falafel, fruit and vegetables.
There are no wild dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
That’s why there are a lot of fed cats here, who gracefully “steal according to their taste”.
In the evening, you can see them sleeping on the rooftops of parked cars.
Predator cats love populated places and tastefully let themselves into every kind of goodness.
Car rental will cost from <0x24>37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to <0x24>188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
Plus insurance - <0x24>15 per day.
And renting a bike will cost around 15 shekels a day.
Tickets to museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Expressed Numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Recognizing the country and resting came the most citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
The promised land was visited by 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists from January to October 2012, which is 51% more than in the same period in 2010, before visa cancellation on February 9, 2011.
"Great and powerful" announces it in Moscow: emigrants will save money on language
While MEPs and human rights defenders are still debating the law on mandatory language exams, fraudsters have already emerged in the country selling “fake” certificates.
13 million foreign workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities every year.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make enough money to support families at home.
On 1 December, the law entered into force, according to which every working migrant will be obliged to pass the Russian language proficiency exam.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services, housing and municipalities, lifestyle and retail sectors.
However, FMS promises that in time, the relevant tests will be mandatory for all visitors.
However, the exams will consist not only of language skills, but also of Russian history and the foundations of law.
Language proficiency will also need to be confirmed for obtaining and extending work permits.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
This law does not apply to people who have successfully obtained a certificate and obtained an academic diploma until the dissolution of the USSR in 1991.
Benefit, Condemnation and Protection of Rights
The network of testing sites will work under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the University of Friendship among Nations, Moscow State University, State University of St. Petersburg and other Russian universities.
Migrants can take exams in all cities; more than 160 such centers are already open in Russia today.
The initiative to support the introduction of testing was also supported by Members of the State Duma and FMS (Federal Migration Service).
But before the law came into force, human rights defenders were able to ask the press many times: and what does it actually bring?
What will change the obligation to know the language for the Russians and for the visitors themselves?
So, above all - according to the representatives of the migration service - it will allow to reduce the number of people who suffer as a result of "child labour."
Many people today are talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, explains the chairman of the FMS Russian Federation in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights should be started before they leave.
Only an organized recruitment system will allow 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise with emigrants without a profession, without an education, who do not know the language and do not have a medical examination.
Without knowledge of the language - he says with conviction Sebelov - the future migrant is sentenced to clashes with dishonest people, who under the pretense of helping him provide a "guide" to terrible, tight accommodations, in which he and dozens of others, like him, are going to be alone and he eats 12 documents without me.
We receive a lot of complaints from our migrant workers.
“They promise one thing in their country, but when they arrive, they are deceased, they are seized with their passports, they are not paying their promised wages,” said Tolib Sharipov, head of Tajik Employment Administration.
Don't worry!
Less so, many citizens of Central Asian republics who intend to go to work in Russia recognize that they not only do not know the language of the country they want to enter, but do not even have experience with the work in question.
Of course, it is not their fault, but rather their misfortune: only very few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford at least adequate basic education.
After all, their families also need something to feed the children, not to mention the fact that they need to be properly dressed, dressed and equipped for school.
As children grow up to a productive age, they must go to work at the first opportunity.
Without knowledge of the language, it is difficult – they admit.
"You feel humiliated and underestimated."
It is true that, with regard to the Law on Language Exams, the human rights defenders point to one important thing.
Testing will only be carried out on migrants who have legal status.
If they do not have it, they will not take the exams, nor will they get any other official work.
In the meantime, most of the migrant workers live illegally in Russia as they used to.
"Welcome or Unauthorized Entry is prohibited"
Many of the incoming workers claim that getting official status in our country is by no means easy.
The reason - bureaucratic obstacles and all those language difficulties.
Legalization, in addition, costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But fake registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
The employees of the Russian police know that we basically have fake documents, without registration, and that leads to cases of extortion.
"They demand a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," - the Tajik citizen Umed Chuskadamov told reporters about his experience.
"Come on, don't be gentle, buy a painting"
On the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it was found that not only the documents of the migrant registration were fake.
FMS employees have already confiscated several fake certificates for completing the language exam.
Fake documents are printed on an ordinary color printer.
Of course, they did not get to new owners for free: each of the migrants, hoping to ease the problem of completing the tests, paid seven thousand rubles for this document.
That’s two and a half times the amount of the official test: it will cost the migrant workers three thousand rubles.
The main task of the near future is to ensure a system against corruption so that workers cannot simply buy documents, as both government officials and human rights defenders agree.
So far, government authorities can promise foreign workers who have failed the tests for the first time that it takes time to complete a basic course in the Russian language.
For visitors who do not speak Russian, it is assumed to work in areas where no active negotiation with people is required.
MVD (Ministry of the Interior) does not put illegal arms market into circulation
The proportion of criminal offences involving the use of legally held weapons is very low
MVD Russia presents a proposal to tighten the law in relation to the owners of civilian weapons.
This is the reaction of government authorities to recent events: the triggers were the shootings at weddings that took place without the victims, and the massacre prepared by Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinograd, which resulted in the deaths of seven people.
Police want to ban the use of dangerous weapons in public places and increase the age from which a license to carry weapons can be obtained - from 18 to 21 years of age.
This idea is supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Jarova, who promised that amendments to the Arms Act will be presented to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the Russian state authorities are trying to deal with the problem by the way of "screwing screws".
An open letter appeared on the network, whose authors - representatives of various social shooting organizations - demanded the rejection of a "non-sensitive enforcement" of the law.
The percentage of bullying with registered weapons is minimal, Vasily Lesnikov, a lawyer and criminalist, said in an interview with the Russian BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, in the six months of 2012, there were 142 offences committed using firearms registered by the Ministry of the Interior authorities, while a total of 1168,000 offences were committed during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that enforcing the laws in the field of civil weapons does not force the offender to move to the "black" market.
According to them, any weapon can now be found in Moscow at a low price.
Currently, the Ministry of the Interior claims that the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from races to officers
The "black" market with weapons is supplied by several channels.
There are five main channels, says Colonel Victor Baranec, who has worked for ten years at the workplaces of the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshots of sites that accept gun orders
The first of them - "military or military route", which means a weapon that was stripped away during the battles in the Caucasus.
"The guns were stolen by Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," Baran<0xC4><0x9B>c says.
Another type of "black weapons" are weapons stolen by criminals from security forces.
Baranec explains that this includes thefts from police warehouses and weapons stolen directly from the employees of the authorities involved in the criminal proceedings.
Illegal "mainly" are available for sale from military warehouses.
In many military warehouses there are often explosions.
"It has been shown that some fires were deliberately grounded - to cover up the deficiency," the former soldier said.
According to Barance, their contribution is also made by gun manufacturers.
“Currently, private arms companies are being created that are not competitive in the international market and are deploying weapons that they deliver to the black market, including Moscow,” he said.
Another source of the “black” market is fraud.
A particularly large number of pistols and automatons come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
“There’s their production, sometimes weapons are produced in small-scale industries, and there’s a mafia that organized their smooth production,” the former soldier explains.
Where did the gun come from?
Experts have summarized the approximate share of individual sources of illegal arms supplies to the "black" market.
The report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Center for Problem Analysis and Public Administration Design.
The specialists compiled reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Russian Statistical Office, criminological literature and data from public data portals focused on the topic of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to investigators, come from military and executive bodies.
Half of all weapons were found in the black market “at fault of officials whose work is linked to weapons,” the report said.
According to data available to researchers, 17% of weapons come from armed conflicts, in 14% of cases there was theft of weapons in their production, 5% is "black archaeology".
The salesman-consultant of one of the arms stores, who asked us not to give his name, is convinced that the weapons found in the black "archaeology" excavations have not been bought for a long time - they are simply too old.
Most often, as they say, vendors ride for new shipments directly to military warehouses.
Through the flagship, the interested buyer buys a unit, such as a TT gun.
You order a gun from him and he sells it to you through the fence.
"He'll take her to the city and sell her for 900 euros with two tanks," he says.
“The truth is that the police are well in the picture, and therefore whenever they start to burn their plan in clarity of crimes, they will make a check-up purchase from illegal arms dealers,” the advisor adds.
"Like in a luxury store"
The seller and the buyer most often find each other through their acquaintances.
I visited websites and blogs until there was a guy who offered me the opportunity to switch to the "Test" platform, where the man who would take me to the "door" where we will act together.
Mostly I found out the price there.
Military reporter Viktor Baranec
If I want to get a gun, I need a friend who knows the way out, says the seller - an advisor.- I have such a friend, but I don't fully trust him.
The merchants are in the market, but there is also a need to go, hypothetically "from Mr. Ivan Ivanovic, who asked me to take care of the daughter's tooth."
And now I'm going to get over the man I'm sure of.
He will give them only to me, because he knows that I will not give them.
Beginners are looking for weapons in a variety of ways.
Former soldier Viktor Baranec attempted to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was working to become a publisher on the subject.
According to him, the scheme has not changed.
They gave him an album with pictures, where it was "everything you thought about."
“I felt like I was in a luxury store,” the soldier recalls.
The buyer, according to Baran<0xC4><0x97>ce, does not offer rabbits in a bag - you can try everything.
I, a potential client, just don't buy - we go with the seller into the woods and we build a target.
"They give me the chance to shoot, and when I'm convinced that the gun shoots well, we start acting," the expert describes the procedure.
Armchair on the sofa
Search engines on the Internet will bring you to the website and groups on "Vkontaktu", where it is offered to buy weapons "for different purposes".
There is no need for documents or personal meetings.
"It's enough to have a set amount of money," they write in the ad title on the website "Buy a gun or machine gun."
On these pages, users leave their notifications and ask questions.
And the sale to minors?
"Of course that without a license," the user asks "Ivan" (the spelling is retained).
"I buy TT.Moscow" - briefly formulates the request "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service has recently decided on a huge network of hacked websites and people who want to buy a military weapon can store a gun.
People roast like starving fish on a pond and then harvest coal in Siberia.
Military reporter and senior military officer Viktor Baranec
I’ve heard of such schemes: websites are usually registered outside the scope of Russian law.
People are taking orders.
The buyer will make the payment through an ATM.
"In response, the seller sends him a photo and a description of where the weapon is hidden," Dmitry Kislov, a spokesman for the NGO, told AFP.
Viktor Baran<0xC4><0x9B>c confirms that after placing an order on the website, you can remain unarmed and be behind bars.
The Federal Security Service has recently decided on a huge network of hacked websites and people who want to buy a military weapon can store a gun.
"People roast like hungry fish on the swamp, and then they harvest coal in Siberia," he said.
Makarov for <0x24>100
When buying an illegal firearm, experts estimate the amount usually between <0x24>100 and <0x24>900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the NGO "Right to Weapons", you will get a <0x24>100-300 Makarov gun.
You have to wait a month to a month and a half.
Weapons are expedited from warehouses for long-term storage through middle-cell warehouses.
According to the official Statistical Office, the number of these crimes in Russia decreased by a total of 7% compared to the period January - October 2011, and accounted for 22.9 thousand cases, and the number of clarified cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, firearms, explosives and equipment.
In the U.S., fast food workers and supermarkets are on strike
“McDonald” works at a cash register will pass up to a quarter of all American teens
In recent days, the wave of protests against low wages in Walmart hypermarkets and in popular fast-food restaurants such as "McDonald", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kettucky".
So far, no one can predict whether this wave will turn into a wave of nine, or whether it will soon disappear.
All this action is supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing social organizations.
In addition to increasing the modest salaries that many Walmart and fast-food workers receive, the goal of the protest organizers is to achieve a set-up within their trade unions.
Currently, this economic sector is virtually unaffected by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The event began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called "Black Friday", when an orgy of cheap sales hit America, haunted millions of people and in some cases was accompanied by fights.
On this day, some employees of Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their workplaces and demonstrated together with trade unions and left-wing activists of multinational business chains whose goods are intended for people from the lower and middle class.
Walmart sells everything around the world, from diapers to hunting guns and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That’s why many low-wage employees in Walmart stores only shop at work.
The availability and range of products have made Walmart one of the largest companies in America.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell the goods so cheaply, in part because it pays little to its employees.
They also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of automatic trolleys or manual scanners.
Demonstrators on "Black Friday" demanded an increase in wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the company rose sharply from <0x24>30 to <0x24>100 a month.
A typical Walmart employee gets <0x24>9.5 an hour, but that doesn’t correspond to the amount of spending, employees say.
Scientists at the University of California in Berkeley say that if Walmart raises the average salary to <0x24>12 an hour, it will cost the company <0x24>3.2 billion a year.
This is an average of 1.1% more than the company is currently spending on wages.
If Walmart moves the wage increase entirely to consumers’ shoulders, each visit to the store will cost only 46 cents more.
In a year, customers will spend about <0x24>12.39 more than they do today.
Walmart’s advocates point out that the protest took place in only nine countries and the company should not cause practically any damage.
"Black Friday" in the company's stores lasted from 8 p.m. on Thursday night until midnight the following day, and during this time Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, its cash registers carried out nearly 100 million transactions on "Black Friday".
Dan Fogelman, a spokesman for the left-wing website Huffington Post, said the jobs had left "less than five" Walmart employees, and that the protest was "another media sensation" organised by trade unions everywhere.
"Unoccupied Treasury!"
Protests continued this week in New York, where their goal was not Walmart’s storehouses (they in that progressive city are not too popular, and therefore almost not here), but “McDonald” and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says he's selling billions of portions, and then he's not paying you off sick and he's not paying you properly for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Council member
Currently, the minimum wage for work in accordance with federal laws and New York State regulations is <0x24>7.25 per hour.
Fast-food restaurants are gradually increasing this salary, but only slightly, and on average, their ranks in New York receive <0x24>8.90 per hour.
No one has a lower salary in this expensive city.
I don't understand how you can live in New York with that kind of money.
McDonald’s employs nearly a quarter of American teens who work behind the desk after school part-time and live with their parents.
Few people see it as their main source of livelihood or plan to stay there for a long time.
Currently, I am constantly meeting in an interview with McDonald’s employees who complain that they have to live from this money and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other side of the Wall Street Journal hangs a comment, the author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
Participants of the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at "McDonald" on 40th Street and on Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and chefs in fast-food businesses start earning at least <0x24>15 an hour, which is more than double their minimum wage.
They also called for the establishment of trade unions in the field of fast-food.
U.S. laws prohibit the administration from preventing the establishment of trade unions and punishing trade union activists by harassment and pardon.
On the other hand, management seldom makes life easier for them.
However, introducing a trade union organisation into fast-food enterprises is also difficult for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is the unusually high fluctuation of employees.
Unauthorized
Noisy protests were also held on this day in a number of other cheap Manhattan restaurants.
The highlight of the event was at a meeting at McDonald's near Times Square, where a number of local Democratic politicians, especially Jumaane Williams, spoke, who said, "McDonald doesn't sell billions of portions, and then he doesn't give you money, and he doesn't give you money."
Protesters also looked forward to the support of other prominent New York Democrats, such as Mayor Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must work together to support fast food workers so that they can achieve fair rewards for their work and economic prosperity!"
As described by the New York Times, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of the American fast food field.
But only a few hundred people took part in it, although not all of them were fast-food workers, employing tens of thousands of people in New York.
Whether this event will become a spark that will light the flame of the mass movement is not yet clear.
"In the meantime, the brain fails on average"
Among fans of modern virtual reality technology is a popular topic of augmented reality; lately it means to perceive the world especially through the edge of special glasses.
At the beginning of summer at its annual conference, Google presented the working model of the novelty, and in November it was announced that the application for the relevant patent was also submitted by Microsoft.
In an interview with the leader of a group of interactive 3D technologies at Microsoft’s Cambridge Laboratory, Sharam Izadim found that the company’s glasses are already a past for scientists.
Attractive is the perspective of manipulating virtual objects in the air with empty hands, creating virtual public spaces.
- Please let us know the framework, what is your research team doing?
- We deal with human-machine interactions, but at the same time we try to push the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity has so far been trapped in the stage of working with pixels on a flat screen, at most sometimes touching the screen with a finger.
We want to look forward to 5-10 years and predict significant changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors - that's a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is on sale without Kinect sensors, because there's a very interesting gesture control option for everyone.
- What else is waiting for us in the future?
- Despite the fact that Kinect system has transferred the interaction to the physical level, very many interactions are still taking place on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input flow of information has improved (the system receives more data), but the output flow has so far not been separate.
We are trying to change this, we are working on truly three-dimensional display systems based on a variety of technologies including projective.
It is necessary to introduce the computer world into our physical world, to make it more real.
For this purpose, however, it is necessary to know not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we will be able to add virtual objects to the real world in a much more convenient form.
And first of all - fuck with those stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
It's a popular thing, but it's not overestimated?
- It certainly cannot be considered a whole-healing - the question of privacy arises, because we do not always want to inform others in our surroundings about our activities and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, for controlling facilities in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not about diverse ones, just such short ones.
The gesture would not be felt by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet that would monitor the movements of bones and muscles.
So far it is large, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of the bracelet watches.
In general, however, the future has a mixed type of control, such as gesture <0x2B> voice.
- How's that?
- How do you, for example, ask me to give you this bottle of lemonade?
You say it and at the same time show it.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, it'll be very difficult to recognize.
- So you want to get the user to adapt to what the machine can or can't at any given moment?
- It's not necessary at all, but it's mutual closeness.
I think that in the near future we will have to work primarily on the development of new types of sensors that will be able to detect human reactions more accurately.
These can be, for example, laser sensors that provide relatively good depth resolution, which is very important.
- If you have to talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for modern cameras?
Is there not enough resolution, depth, or something else today?
- Essentially the current generation - that's what we can reflect in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 f/s.
But it's not just about the megapixels themselves, but as nuts and depth.
With the current view of things, all the current technologies are insufficient for us - this assigns work to the designers of algorithms.
So we have to remember not only the resolution in the X and Y axes, but also Z.
So very important is also the speed, the number of shots per second.
Human movement is relatively dynamic and current data streams of 30 images per second are frankly little, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes from our Redmond laboratory made a touch sensor with adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms, while current, serial-produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands the extent to which this affects a person’s interaction with a machine.
For me, the work would be a very useful equivalent of such a device, I just don’t need so many touch, but I need some extra shots per second.
- And there's no need to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect system now uses three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other - a receiver of the reflected signal.
And the third camera - it's actually a common sensor of the visible band.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
More cameras could potentially solve the problem.
Or worsen it, because it would increase the necessary volume of calculations performed.
It would be nice to create a flexible Kinect analog system, play with the camera position curve and see how it will help in determining the three-dimensional position.
“If I remember correctly, Microsoft (unlike Google) did not publicly present its glasses.
Don’t you think that when it comes to the daily use of augmented reality technology with special glasses, it’s one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking and constantly holding the smartphone in raised hands is not very comfortable, but I think: the most powerful variant would be the "portable" form of reality extension, when it would be possible to switch on the cloud platform at any time.
Glasses - this is a very personal device, in it is their strength (private things you only see), and at the same time weakness - augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects simultaneously with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in "Iron Man", but also to the ordinary mortal.
There is one problem that critics often point to: there is no tactile response!
Your hands can't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
In my lectures, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh consecutive breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think that supplementing the tactile signals could calmly become the eighth breakthrough.
So far, one of the interesting tricks is being used - the use of the second hand as a kind of base for displaying.
It records compression in an excellent way!
But there are also technologies that are really focused on adding tactility to these "images in the air" - for example, interference of several directional ultrasound rays at a defined point, where the finger is located, triggers a touch sensation, but it's still very weak on the scalp - as if it's a scalp.
There is also a bracelet on the wrist that affects the nerve endings in the fingers - also a promising direction.
- Have you ever tried to fool your brain?
To think he feels what he seems to feel at the moment when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
Here comes another challenge that will be fought for a long time - how to get a person who is physically in a very narrow space to believe that he walks in an open, practically infinite space - we also work on the concept of clubs as well as platforms such as those that are not endless.
If brain deception becomes the target, then work is still for many years.
That’s what makes work on virtual reality so appealing to researchers – a lot of things are at the very beginning.
Language instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is the continuation of the project "Petersburg avant-garde", dedicated to citizens who are leading, are the avant-garde of culture and art.
At the top of the list were already significant figures of the St. Petersburg art scene, whose achievements exceed the city, often found recognition in Europe without reaching the all-Russian popularity.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the stunning artist Cyril Miller.
The whole city knows Cyril Miller - a bearded man who is all dressed in red, which you meet here at the Russian Museum, here at the Summer Gardens, here in the fashion halls and at the vernissades.
Cyril Miller’s paintings, wherever they are exhibited, are always attracted by the crowd of viewers.
Cyril Miller is one of the purely social and philosophical narrators of St. Petersburg, creators of new mythologies.
Cyril Miller is a prominent man of the St. Petersburg avant-garde in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
In addition to being an urban man, his appearance on the streets induces a smile on the faces of citizens, increases mood for everyone.
Recently he took bottles into his hands and became a bottleneaker in St. Petersburg, because he matured in this complex role with his entire Bohemian life, philosophy and image.
Cyril, why are you walking all over the city in red and not in yellow or, for example, in turquoise?
- I chose the red color as a designer dealing with the appearance and the image.
In this world, the red color represents a compromise between the artist, the image maker and the public.
Although it is generally true that everything that is slightly different from grey, arouses aggression and arouses bad qualities.
But my provocations are aimed at having an interview.
The whole history of my provocative acts is, above all, an invitation to debate.
- And when did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At the exhibition at the House of Culture in Nevsk where my work was exhibited.
I understand what my path is.
At that time, a wave of free old unofficial artists and new, free types of artists was gone, I could not understand.
I became friends with the artists of the new wave, with the post-Gazonians who brought us to the "Pushkin 10", and there were no other waves.
It attracts me to theater, to dress up, to music, to all genres except words.
- And it all came together in your art clinic...- It was important to me to be at the center of the culture of St. Petersburg, where all the best forces of creativity should be gathered.
In 1995, I took my place at Pushkinskaya 10, and before the reconstruction there was a music and art club, a Bohemian club, the home of the St. Petersburg Bohemian.
There were many born:NAME, Tequila Jazz, do not forget how <0xC5><0xA0>nura was brought up with the project "Echo Van Gogh".
<0xC5><0xA0>nor and his friends sang under the cover of light songs, dressed in adjoining jerseys, among them composer Igor Vdovin, who is now in fashion.
When the band began to play live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg led many Hali-Galian times programs.
We gave Tracht<0xC4><0x9B>nberg to them, and he started his great career, basic education and training from us.
Gallery "D 137", club "Griboedov - this is the sound of Art Clinic.
This is where our employees and regular guests leave.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture meant something else.
In 2000 a survey was held in the press, the special prize was "People in Our City".
In the "Artist of the Year" nomination, I was nominated, so my summit ended.
In the new times, according to the old rules, work is unpleasant, I am a man of truth, honesty, and culture of the last century.
In modern years it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things today, you can be popular, but not too cultural.
- Your works are characteristic in a recognizable way.
- Many of my paintings - these are hits in which the actuality and insight are captured live.
I'll have the program exhibition "Russian Museum in Clowns".
Clowns are a temporary category.
I used to be social, today being like that is painful and terrible.
But in the clowns, everything is blurred, it's tragic.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, to save the world through totalitarian transformation in the order.
Today, people meet according to their clothes, focusing on the external mechanics, not on the inner person.
Or maybe you can't give him a hand and you have to swim in his face.
And the lie will be removed by changing.
- We've seen you recently as a city bottler. - A cultural city should have such a hero.
And who would it be if it wasn't me?
- And can commercial art be beautiful?
- Currently, commercial, useful art should be thorough, tactful, sweet.
There is a disintegration of cultures.
Previously, people met in the depths, the Bohemian loved one, the simple other people.
Today, everything is broken up into micro-society, today it is very difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a stallion banknote to please everyone.
Today, you need to think about who you like.
Today, every cultural hero has his 100 fans.
- And there will be a few thousand spectators at Mikhailov's Stas!
- He's a fan, and there's the sexual-social sphere.
And 300 people will come to the cultural ground and 10,000 won't come, and the result is less management, less money, it's all going to burn.
I have fans, the main thing is that no one cheats on them and disrupts what is experienced.
When I was young, I painted such paintings that a collector hung on the wall with Falk and Larion.
I started with pictures that people usually end up with.
Today, people often confuse their concepts.
They say: culture of the spiritual, culture of the consumer.
There is no culture of consumerism, it's gone.
I'm a man of yesterday's culture, I grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused money for drawing paintings.
And I'm for that culture.
Cyril, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good culture specialists.
There is such a concept: the factor across culture.
Not every one of them can deal with culture.
In the days of the proper emperors, this was not the case at all, the emperors perhaps did not very well understand the culture, but understood that it was necessary to be supported by real experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
We have people in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they are stuck somewhere in the corner, because they need great experts who appreciate these experts correctly and lead them on the right path.
Nowadays, the church flourishes.
The same Erart, but they differ by saying frankly that we do not accept all modern art, there are artists who should look for other museums.
- What do you think St. Petersburg is?
- Petersburg - it is not the capital of culture, in Moscow there is culture much more, there is the right land.
And at our peak, art is poor.
We need a cultural ground, but there are more writers here today than readers, that’s bad.
There are a lot of people in Europe who are curious, who like to go to exhibitions, concerts.
In us, such a layer is only weak.
We need art to become a fashion issue, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is implemented through a grant from St. Petersburg
Born in space
The country is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of space shuttles with terrestrials on board are embarking on a journey, looking for a replacement planet.
To save humanity, the main question arises: how to keep your family in a burden-free environment or on a given substitute planet?
I don't think the choice is great.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be conquered, even if only hypothetically.
"It's Venus and Mars," said Vladimir Surdin, a senior scientist at the State Astronomical Institute of P. K. Sternberg (SAI<0xC5><0xA0>).
While there are better conditions for life on Mars, temperatures on the surface of Venus reach 500 degrees Celsius.
It is only possible to live there at a high altitude or orbiting Venus... in space.
To solve the questions of reproduction in space, scientists began with the flora.
Already half a century ago, experiments were conducted on plants.
Four generations of game grown on a orbital path are no different from their terrestrial relatives.
Then an insect was carried out to orbit - very small fruit flies Drosophila.
In 1979, turkey eggs were sent into space to check how the embryo develops in a state of unloading.
At the exit we get an absolutely normal bird.
But then the problems begin.
“The problem is that this bird has to find resistance, it has to stand on its own feet and start moving,” says Vladimir Sy<0xC4><0x8D>ev, head of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP) RAN.
If they find no resistance, the birds fall chaoticly and make bugs.
After 10 hours, the instincts of freshly shed birds completely disappeared.
The birds did not respond to light or sound.
And the problem was that within four days they simply died.
“We let the birds fly twice, but then we refused, because it’s simply impossible to work with them there,” comments Vladimir Sy<0xC4><0x8D>ev, the failure of the experiment with chickens in space.
The last "miniarch" of animals flew in orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
In the biosatellite "Bion" but there will be only beings of one gender.
An experiment was conducted with rats who were already pregnant when they were being transmitted to space.
Basically, they didn't find anything supernatural there.
"It was only on biosatellites, but again - this is a unique experiment and such experiments need to be carried out," says Vladimir Sy<0xC4><0x8D>ev.
After landing on Earth, a descendant of space rats was born.
However, it has not yet been possible to approach the problem of reproduction directly in space.
It's a difficult task.
Animals, if they lose their normal environment, simply can’t realize their sexual instincts.
Man, unlike animals, can in principle.
Homo sapiens governs abstract thinking and is able to create a corresponding emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments do not take place.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The greatest danger was the Tereshkovs.
The most precious thing humanity has is a woman’s body.
Our Teapot flew away and no one on Earth could say if it would take flight into space.
She can give birth to a baby after such a year.
"No one has answered this question yet," said Vachtang Va<0xC4><0x8D>nadze, a veteran of the rocket and space industry.
In June 1964, more than a year after the flight into space, the first woman-cosmonaut Valentina T<0xC4><0x9B>re<0xC5><0xA1>ková gave birth to her daughter.
The child's father was also cosmonaut Andriyan Nikolayev.
In 1988, Svetlana Savi<0xC4><0x8D>ka, the son of the second woman-cosmonaut, was born, who visited the orbit twice and also worked in the open space.
However, the risk remains.
We have only a few cosmonauts, who have been born to and are growing health descendants after many years.
"In addition, it can be dangerous even in orbital years," says cosmonaut-pilot, Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of Russia Valery Poljakov.
Yet humanity must inevitably look for new pathways in the fields of biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
The CPK Hydrolaboratory is a mandatory stage of flight preparation.
Here, under zero-attractive conditions, the cosmonauts learn the habits needed to work in open space.
Water simulates the state of weightlessness.
Although for adults, water is a comfortable, but in a strange way environment, for young children it is a natural food.
It seems that small ittians confirm that life on earth comes from the ocean.
There is a correlation between the fact that the baby is on average 9 months in the mother’s fertile water and then it’s easier for them to get used to the water.
In principle, it is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of that first bath, only 2 weeks pass.
“It’s very little to make a child forget something,” says newborn swimming instructor Marina Aksenov.
In a nutshell - if the state of a newborn is a more natural state without difficulty, then for women there is a more natural inevitable gravity, an attractive force.
In a state of severity, very quickly itching of the abdominal muscles, the muscles of the pancreas, decreases the ability of the body to excrete the fetus.
This can be avoided if muscle stimulants work during childbirth.
After all, it is possible for the birth to take place in a special chamber, in which the mother's organism expels the fetus.
"And what next?" asks Valery Poljakov complex questions.
On the other hand, the baby also needs artificial gravity.
If the body is not affected by terrestrial attraction, it is not able to properly shape the bone or the muscle system.
A newborn on the circuit is not possible to dress as an adult in a special outfit with a load in which he could train.
He will simply be deprived of what he needs unconditionally for his development.
“If we go with you to an experiment that will allow the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we will bring a disabled person to Earth who will be completely unadapted to the local environment,” predicts IBMP Bioethics Commissioner RAN Igor Pestov.
So the birth of children in space today is just a theoretical question.
One day, however, the time will come when the Earth will become a reality, and when the Earthlings will emigrate in their cubes to a distant planet that will be home to their offspring born in space.
NK<0xC3><0x9A> chief: Control of the black system failed to blame politicians
The Czech Republic has a good inspector and quality legislation in relation to the public procurement, but it fails in its application.
In an interview for Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz, Vice President of the Supreme Audit Office Miloslav Kala said that.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be the right application - that's what we think is missing," Kal said.
Similar conclusions are also suggested by the joint inspection of Czech and German inspectors.
As an example of wrong practice, Peter Neczae's approach to the so-called "square system" is cited.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that ODS will not harass entrepreneurs with its controls - so is it banned or allowed?
“The law must be set in some way, and if something is forbidden, even the prime minister cannot prevent an office that is obliged to monitor and enforce duties,” Kala said.
At the meeting of the Control Committee in the House of Representatives, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech and the German side, in which the legislation relating to public procurement in both countries was compared.
What exactly was this about?
This is a parallel check that we started about two years ago.
Simply put, European legislation regulates the way public procurement is handled, followed by individual national legislation and then by the practice itself.
We have put all this together, and even though the inspection is not finished, we have found very interesting differences - in general, the legislation may be "stricter and more perfect" with us, but the practice itself is better in some parameters in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to create more and more precise rules, but it is necessary to focus on the application of law itself.
What can this project actually do to help you with what’s going on for you?
It is precisely this kind of joint control that could help us to stop spending our efforts on clarifying laws, reducing and improving limits, where this does not have such a positive impact.
Economics means obtaining the right thing at a reasonable (but not always the lowest) price, in order to exclude enrichment and, if necessary, criminal activity.
But by reducing the limit of contracts, we don’t necessarily have to achieve that.
Perhaps the system is loaded with so much "paper" that those who want to search for holes in the system will be much easier to pull out than if the limit remained higher.
You are talking about domestic problems with the implementation of legislation relating to public procurement.
How does the control system in Germany work?
Is there an office similar to our NGO, or is it set differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the Bundesbuchungshof, which is organized in the same way as we do, also has a college, which is formed in a slightly different way, but in principle both authorities are acting accordingly.
The powers are also to some extent similar, however, in that Germany has a federal arrangement, so these Courts of Auditors also have at the level of the individual federal countries - in that the system differs slightly from ours.
The BRH can only control federal money, represented by state funds.
The public funds, which are managed by the counties and municipalities, are checked there from the level of the Federal Courts of Auditors.
As far as the legislation is concerned, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare this without specific data, but in some respects Germany has been designated a model, but it cannot be said to be better at all.
Is it because they have better controls?
I'm sure not, but again, I don't like comparisons like that.
But it must be said that even the countries that we consider to be a model are facing a number of problems.
Otherwise, it would be no benefit to them to cooperate with our office, would it?
As far as domestic legislation, which has meant a new public procurement law for your office, are its effects already manifest in some way?
Since the period of validity of this novel is relatively short, it does not yet appear in the control actions with us.
Since we do ex post checks, it is necessary to count on a certain delay.
We are only seeing this so far in the process of preparing for future controls - we have launched our new tool "detection of risks of inequality", through which we have passed almost 14,000 public procurement, and we have analyzed them - that changes will manifest itself in the process of making future checks, because they will change the limits and the types of surveys will change.
So do you consider the adoption of this law to be a benefit, or a further burden on the system of bureaucracy?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that may arise here is that the rules will be "strict" and it will not be possible to follow them.
Already for the operation of the previous rules, the audited persons are obliged by the provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes by the Regional Council) that any non-compliance with the Public Procurement Act constitutes a breach of the budgetary penalty.
Does the law have to be tightened in this way?
I don't think this way.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse it, and not punish those who make a formal mistake that has no impact on decision making.
Such a system will only create more pressure on bureaucracy.
So how do you get out of it?
Let's show ourselves where the road doesn't lead.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that ODS will not harass entrepreneurs by checking the so-called "square system" - and what does that mean?
Is the swedish system banned or allowed?
After all, the law must be set in some way, and if something is forbidden, even the Prime Minister cannot prevent an office that is obliged to perform checks and enforce duties.
He can say, "Let's change the law and let's do it," but he can't say we're going to do anything like that.
In the Public Procurement Act, there are relatively strict rules on how to be formally implemented - which is correct in order to protect public competition.
But on the other hand, it is tragic when the interested party with the best offer is excluded only for formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be the right application - that's what I think is missing.
The roads are slippery, but mostly slippery.
In several parts of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and snowy.
Most of the time, however, the roads are slippery, with increased caution.
Karlovy Vary
In the Karlovy Vary region this morning roads were sloping, but the places were frozen and also snowed.
The temperature dropped between five and ten degrees below zero, but it is expected to warm slightly during the day.
Snowfall in the region has stopped and there is only a weak layer in the lowlands.
However, there is about 30 centimeters of snow on the hills of the Krush Mountains.
The spots were also less visible due to the fog, according to the data of the regional motorists' dispatch.
R6 highways and first-class communications are now unrestricted in the region.
However, caution is in place, for example, on some bridges, where the surface can be frozen and slippery.
All second and third-class roads, including mountain roads, are also accessible.
However, in some sections there are still remains of ice and places of caught snow.
Above all, in higher positions, it is necessary to pay more attention to driving.
Pardubice and Královéhradek County
On some roads in the eastern Czech Republic, there is a risk of frost, in higher places and in the mountains, a layer of snow can be caught on the roads, informs the Directorate of Roads and Highways on its website.
Motorists warn drivers of frost, it can be formed especially in the higher positions of the Pardubice region.
The lake can be located in the vicinity of Lan<0xC5><0xA1>krouna, <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Orlicí, Poli<0xC4><0x8D>ky, Svitav or High Myth, especially on the second and third-class roads.
The I/43 and I/34 roads at Svitav are chemically treated.
Snow is especially on the roads in the Mountains and the Orly Mountains.
The captured snow layer is at the highest positions on the roads in the districts of Rychnov nad Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>ná and Trutnov.
In eastern Czechoslovakia it is most often clear to moderately clear without precipitation.
Temperatures usually range between minus three and plus one degree Celsius, a slight wind blows.
Plze<0xC5><0x88> County
The roads in the Plze<0xC5><0x88> region are steering this morning, but places with increased caution and driving needs to be adapted to the weather.
It is frozen in the morning, the temperatures range between three to nine degrees below the point of freezing.
After previous snowing and subsequent cooling, some communications may be frozen.
Drivers also have to rely on the fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This comes from the information of the regional motorists' dispatch.
Highway D5 is almost unrestricted, however, increased caution is recommended by road operators between 80 and 131 kilometres.
Most first-class roads have a dry and frozen surface.
In southern Plze<0xC5><0x88> and Tachovsko, however, there may be frozen sections.
Communications of the second and third grades are wet and also in this case warnings of frost sections apply.
Drivers should be cautious, especially on less frequent roads in the <0xC5><0xA0>umava area.
Olomouc County
With snow on the road today, drivers must count towards the highest positions of the Olomouc region.
After the chemical dispersion, she remained on the Red Mountain Seat and on the road towards the Videl Cross.
The motorists shoved snow into the field at night, and the road managers said they snowed about three centimeters in <0xC5><0xA0>umperska.
In other parts of the region, roads are generally unrestricted.
"On <0xC5><0xA0>umperska lies the remains of snow in the highest positions.
With snow cover at the <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorská sedla, drivers have to count towards Jeseník," said <0xC4><0x8C>TK road administration dispatcher today.
Their colleagues also went to the field at night to Jesenick, and the roads to the highest positions are now, according to them, bare and wet after chemical treatment.
On Olomouc, roads are unrestricted, but drivers should be careful in forest areas where roads remain wet.
<0xC3><0x9A>stek<0xC3><0xBD> kraj, Liberec<0xC3><0xBD> kraj
A number of difficult places of departure are reported this morning by motorists in the north of the Czech Republic.
In addition to several places with snow or glacier, the mountain road from Telnice na Knínica na <0xC3><0x9A>stecka is also closed, according to the police database.
The temperatures are kept even in lower positions below zero, so ice and snow are likely to endure on the roads.In the lowlands, especially southeast of the Czech Central Mountains, on the contrary, there are no problems and the roads are usually dry.
Operating complications have not yet been reported.
The occurrence of the glacier is reported by motorists in particular from the surrounding <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>tí.
According to meteorologists, the conditions were ideal for her at night - during the day rain and heavy snow, at night light and cold.
From the main turns, adverse conditions are also reported on the I/13 road on the borders of the <0xC3><0x9A>stek and Liberec region.
The closure from Telnice to Knínice was forced by the folded branches of the trees that bent to the carriage under the application of the snow.
Simon Ornest: We want to accumulate positive energy at concerts
What do you think is the end of the world in less than a month?
It's just one of the other scary news we people like to catch.
Together with The Tap Tap, we are making fun of it and saying that we are the only band in the world that can accumulate enough positive energy to push or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, in December you will organize a completely individual project of three concerts towards the end of the world.
Can you introduce it to readers?
This is a nationwide beneficence action that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced on December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
3 concerts will be held simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava on the day before December 20th from 9 p.m.
They will end around the time when the Mayan calendar ends on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean, which is in the 12-hour time zone ahead of us.
Who came up with this idea?
At first it was probably my idea, then we invented it all together with our artist Honsa Augusta.
In addition to accumulating enough positive energy and preventing the end of the world, together with the public, we also want to think about the state in which we will one day pass this world on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also created a unique collection of boots, t-shirts, bags or original keys to the end of the world whose purchase on www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The Tap Tap group, along with other performers, also sang a so-called anthem against the end of the world, which is called "The End of the World Cancelled".
It is already very popular on YouTube, will it also be on these beneficent concerts?
Of course, and in a complete conclusion, so if everything succeeds and the end of the world does not happen...
All performers will sing it at all three concerts at the same time.
The anthems will also be connected in a unique live broadcast on Czech TV.
The words to this song he wrote and the main role of Jesus in the clip is played by Tomás Hanák, also singing in it Xindl X...
How did you get to work with them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, since we organize a lot of charitable events and concerts...
We are working hard to get them involved in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested and enjoying working with us.
What are the benefits of concerts at the end of the world?
On the equipment of the barrier-free educational center Studeo, which we have been implementing for the sixth year with the civil association Tap in the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute.
Students of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute regularly visit the lecturers and engage them in activities that they enjoy and are interested in.
The students themselves do not have the means to go after the lecturers themselves, so we try to enable them this way.
As part of the construction of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, a separate building will be built in the future, to which we will move with this project.
There will be several music groups and performers at each concert.
What did you choose for them?
We've been trying to build a program that addresses all generations, including children.
For example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Such<0xC3><0xBD> will perform in Prague.
You can find out all the details at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning a similar "bombastic event" in the future?
In May we will perform at the Prague Spring for the first time, so we will certainly prepare an interesting program with interesting guests here too.
Next year we would also like to play at the Czech National House in New York, and personally, when we are in the US, I would like to link it to a performance in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not minimalistic, so far you have performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow, for example.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these journeys logistically and organisationally?
It's not as bad as it looks at first glance.
We have five members on an electric trolley, her trolleys have to travel in the luggage compartment, and of course we train with us a large amount of cargo and body with tools...
However, so far it has always been handled without any problems, <0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways were perfectly prepared for us, that I was astounded as many times.
Even in Moscow, from which we returned recently, it was without problems.
With trips abroad, you can compare how individuals differ in accessibility, public access to disabled people and the like.
What have you met so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where things work better than we do, we have witnessed in Russia that everything in the east is still at the very beginning.
In contrast to Prague, Moscow is very barrier-free, and it is still unusual for an electric car to move in the city centre.
There is no such thing as preference for wheelchairs in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are already civil associations that are trying to alert people with disabilities.
What, on the other hand, do we still need to encourage more developed countries?
There's a lot of things we're still behind...
However, it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation is always dependent on the efforts of the people concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with severe disabilities to move independently in public, to go to the toilet, to a museum, anywhere...
But it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to actively participate in social life there, on the contrary, we are a little ahead with The Tap Tap!
Respect for the public or accessibility is one thing, but only when we become important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers will things really start to change.
So far, these are unique cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap is very popular at the moment, but let’s go back a few years ago what led you to founded it in 1998?
I joined the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute as an educator, where I had a lot of young people around me who were interested in doing something.
And since I am a musician myself, I play saxophone, among other things, so I and my colleague founded an interesting music ring.
Well, over time, as our moderator Lá<0xC4><0x91>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D> says, it got a little out of hand (laughs).
But has popularity only come in recent years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us when we started connecting with famous singers and also actively working on the promotion of the band.
We found that the work that is not visible is essentially as if it does not exist.
In addition, thanks to the contributions from the European Union, we can afford high-quality lecturers, equipment and so on.
Was it your goal to pull it up with The Tap Tap so high?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to do something different.
Showbusiness is full of things where one imitates the other.
It is logical in its own way, everything new is carefully accepted and it takes a long time.
Things that are unique are very few, but I dare to claim that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is, of course, regret, that is natural.
But this regret is absolutely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not suffering from all the abandoned beings that we have to regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, provided they have the means to do so.
I'm saying that if something happens to people with a disability, it's not just for them, it's for the whole society.
Did this success also help you to be a strict boss, as many people have labeled you?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be uncompromising in many things and demand some discipline.
But I think that's completely normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic idea and with their head in the clouds, and when they find that they have to go to the exam twice a week, come to the preparation and spend a lot of time on the way to concerts, so the enthusiasm is to leave quickly.
But this is how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and that wants to achieve something.
Currently, The Tap Tap has 20 members.
How many of them were at its beginnings in 1998?
Only one Ladja Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D>.
We are an open group, people are leaving and coming, that cannot be prevented.
Whoever has the will and the taste always has the door open.
It will take place the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 from 9 p.m.
It will take place in Prague Incheba Arena, Brno Fléd<0xC4><0x9B> and Ostrava Plynojem with the participation of 12 chapels and other musicians from the Czech Republic
All three cities will join the telemost at the end of the evening with a joint song by The Tap Tap "End of the World Cancelled"
The aim of the concert is to raise funds for the equipment of the multifunctional barrier-free education centre STUDEO at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute in Prague in the amount of 25 million CZK
Tickets for the concert are 400 CZK, children under 12 years of age have free tickets at the Bohemiaticket pre-sale
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at a meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was accepted as the twentieth member of this European space agency, as the second country from the countries of the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with the ESA in 1994 and over the next few years participated in a number of projects of the Agency.
However, Poland’s journey into space began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts devoted themselves to flying into space before the Second World War; but they did not always meet with understanding.
For example, I recall the lecture by A. Sternfeld at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, which presented ideas from his pioneering work on 6 December 1933.
The ideas of a young engineer (born 1905) left the listeners cold and after years sternerfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, sternfeld received the award of Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for his Entrance into the Cosmonautics in France.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote a number of books devoted to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became a world-famous propagator of the cosmonautics and his contribution was also appreciated by one of the craters on the reverse side of the moon being named by his name.
Already in 1925 a railroad was built in Poland, which was to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is not known and the details of the project are not known.
It is also unclear whether the rocket was to be used to take off the dredge or to brake it.
Information about this color is only known from the time print.
From 1933, the Polish artillery began to be occupied by rockets.
The research was provided by the Arms Technology Cell in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfk and Prof. Gustav Mokrzyckieg.
From the preserved materials, it is apparent that the research has reached the stage of practical trials.
However, with the arrival of the German troops, the research was interrupted.
In 1937, the design of the photoelectric hunting rocket, designed by the engineer Rohozi<0xC5><0x84>ski, appeared in the professional press, and the following year the work of the Rakete - an air torpedo and a rocket bomb by the author Leliwy-Krzywoblock.
Both projects were intended for military use of rocket engines.
Shortly before the war, the Interim Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Advisory Committee-Scientific Committee) was responsible for all projects of military use of rocket technology.
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the war ended.
After the war, another work dedicated to the astronauts appeared in the Polish press thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautice).
For the first time there is a mention of the company in the November issue of the 1954 issue of the magazine Problems, in which four more comprehensive articles are devoted to astronautics.
In one of them, by Prof. M. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a company that will deal with cosmonautics.
At the time, projects of artificial satellites had already begun and it was clear that space research was a field of perspective.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) has been trying to join the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951) and already in the autumn became a regular member of the PTA.
And in the following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice-president of the International Astronautic Federation.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, PTA has been significantly involved in the development of a very successful meteorological rocket RM (Meteorological Rocket), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The 1800-metre missile was about 80 cm long and weighed less than 5 kg.
Later, an improved version of the RM-1A was built and in the summer of 1959, a two-stage RM-2 missile was launched in the Bled Desert.
The missile was 1.4 meters long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of development was already to be able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 was to have access to up to 14.5 km and its task was to monitor the altitude wind.
However, in 1962, further developments were suspended.
The successor to the first RM rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket developed from 1962 to 1965.
The missile was designed as a two-stage, with a total length of 510 cm and a starting weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (marked Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differed in the size of space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a space of 0.4 litres, a Meteor-1B of 0.34 litres and a Meteor-1C of 0.62 litres.
The maximum accessibility for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 was developed by the Aircraft Institute, the first flight tests of which began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket weighed 380 kg and was able to carry a useful load of 10 kg to an altitude of about 60 km.
Subsequently, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
The entry of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of the COSPAR National Committee two years later.
Poland also participated in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites as part of the Interkosmos programme, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remkov.
Repealing the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court overturned the Public Works Act.
The resolution sparked a lively debate in the public.
It will certainly be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
Liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU as well as in a globalised world are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
In its effect, this means that individual economic systems, national economic systems, are in permanent conflict with each other.
The cause is the principle of free trade and the free, nothing-limited movement of private capital, together with incessant financial speculation.
Due to significant differences in labour price, (salary) price tensions occur.
Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the situation in which a producer tries to maintain competitiveness by importing cheap goods by "distorting" the competitor's price in order to attract more market share and thereby increase its own profits.
On a mass scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either to translate production into a foreign country, or to buy cheaply there, or to disappear.The result is high unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility, and hence the responsibility for the unemployment it produces, the social expenditures of the state necessarily increase.
The whole situation is reinforced by the complete reluctance of the entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thereby compensate for the economic and social damages that he suffered in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so widely known that it is not necessary to provide specific statistical data.
Private capital practices create a situation in the individual economies where the governments of the individual countries are forced to enter into mutual competition in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital.
In other words, governments give private capital to their own population, regardless of the social decline.
This is mainly reflected in the amendments to the applicable laws.
The aim is to economically force the own population to adopt a price dictatorship of private capital, especially in the field of wages.
This is done by means of a system of economic taxation in the case of long-term unemployment, but by restricting the rights of workers in the field of labour law.
The result is increasing poverty along with increasing disparities between the poor and the rich.
For many years, there have been public spending of food in the SRN for the poor, who are unable to enjoy their own work.
The number of these people is already in the millions.
As part of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, it is quite common for decently employed people to receive such a salary that they must be paid to the minimum level of existence.
Such a scandal has also been published in the case of auxiliary employees of the federal parliament.
The austerity measures of virtually all the southern EU states will undoubtedly lead to the same situation where people under the pressure of a catastrophic social downturn are forced either to emigrate as it was in the 19th century, or to live at the cost of starvation at the margins of society, perhaps in the hope that
But we have to ask, where does it come from?
If it is from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, because Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, or Turks, Moroccans, or Egyptians, or Africans are still working for a fraction of the European wage.
This applies to the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media argue that the state cannot participate capitally in its own economy, that a managed economy leads to an economic catastrophe.
Private equity in sweepstakes insists that the State should not interfere with the economy by means of management interventions.
Then one must ask whether private capital is not influencing, it is now actually governing politics and thus the whole state in its own egoistic sense.
There is a clear answer that yes.
The existence of a virtually omnipotent lobby in all states is proof.
The result is a desperate situation manifesting in the field of corruption, providing mutual benefits, legislation, where virtually everything is criminal, but nothing criminal.
In the SRN, the situation is such that the State ministries for lack of funds are in charge of drafting laws to private law firms that are lazy in connection with the industry.
These bills are then approved by the Bundestag.
All power comes not from the people as Western-type constitutions say, but from financially strong groups preferring their own interests.
It is obvious that liberal-oriented democracy is now rapidly getting into the situation, as described by Appiános in his work The Crisis of the Roman Republic in the days of Caesar and Pompey: "The state has been in complete disintegration for a long time and the authorities have been obsessed with violence.
For rewards, illegally obtaining grace and using stones or swords.
The insolence and corruption swelled without any restraint, and the people went to the elections with a pre-sold voice. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Conclusion As in antiquity, the present society is based on the relentless preferences of its own benefit irrespective of the general social interest.
In essence, private capital is no longer able to understand and apply the benefit of society as a whole.
The result is now, as then, an unprecedented decade of elites without any effort to reform deeper.
We must therefore look for the cause of the rise of fascist and communist regimes in the reckless liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
At the present moment, the disappearance of these systems in favour of liberal democracy can be considered a certain break with the expectation of another cycle.
Particularly disastrous is the fact that today’s elites are completely ignoring in the future the possible hundreds of thousands of lives lost, humanitarian and social disasters that we are already witnessing together with the crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.
Repealing the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least not permanent.
Under the pressure of economic competition both at the international and at the European level, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is systemic.
The solution is aimed at political and social reforms that will strengthen the state’s participation in the economy, strengthen the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favour of the state.

After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, there have been many reactions.
Some stand behind Israel, argue for its right to self-defense, and the Palestinians fit into the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, argue for the racism of the Israeli state, the genocide of the Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel fit into the role of the terrorist state.
I do not want to think about who is the culprit in the recurring waves of murder and who are the victims, after all, the inhabitants of today's Israel, including self-governing territories, were born into the current political situation and did not experience the onset of violence.
I want to offer readers a look behind the curtain, a look at who has been serving the 95-year-old tension (calculated since Balfour’s declaration in November 1917) on a small piece of the Middle East.
Some of my considerations are supported by available historical facts, some are derived from them based on my own understanding of who, or which group of people, is the main driver of the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is primarily the history of the struggle for power.
In every epoch we can look for some Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether it was always these personalities who controlled their steps completely autonomously, or whether there was someone behind their throne who directed their actions towards a predetermined goal.
We must admit that we are living in a time when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of several individuals, and that this concentration of money and the power derived from it could not have occurred in the lives of one generation.
Among these astronomically wealthy families stands one that could be considered the head of the squirrel (if anyone is still standing above them I don't know, but I don't exclude it) - the Rothschilds.
There's not much written about them.
- Of course.
The first news agency (Reuters) was bought in the 1990s to stop linking their name to high criminal acts in which they stood and which have always meant for them the strengthening of power, the multiplication of wealth, or both.
They have major shares in almost all the world’s central banks and against countries where the shares in the central bank do not lead or are preparing wars (before the invasion of Afghanistan it was 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq it was 5 countries, after the fall of Gaddafi’s central bank, the Russians were left in the rubble, but read only.
Anyone who tried to rebel against this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to restore the Rothschild Bank of America's central bank status, began spending his own (government) money during the Civil War, and was murdered in 1865 at the theatre.
JFK began to spend his own money and wanted to cancel the FED, he was murdered in 1963, MP Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the FED for triggering a major economic crisis in 1929.
Their desire for global power led in 1859-1871 to the formulation of the plan of the three world wars by Albert Pike's 33rd consecration.
The first war was meant to remove the great monarchist state units in Europe, the second was meant to remove the colonial rule in particular the United Kingdom, and the third was meant to reduce the world population to somewhere between 0.5 and 1 billion people, the absolute number of slaves (such as the number of slaves) to their comfort and luxury, and the only thing to do is to reduce the world population to 0.5 to 1 billion.
The method a group of the wealthiest families is working with the Rothschilds is to trigger a crisis and then offer a solution (order ab chao – order from chaos).
However, these solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the establishment of the FED so as not to repeat a crisis like the one it triggered in 1907).
So after they succeeded in assassinating the Habsburg R-U successor of the throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo to unleash World War I, they destroyed Imperial Russia by launching the Bolshevik revolution.
World War I ended abruptly, militaryly and economically unfounded, the surrender of Germany (there was no longer a need for war to destroy Imperial Russia) and subsequently the breakdown of the Central European power, Austria Hungary.
For the easiest start of the Second World War, the bankers of politics were able to create a latent conflict situation by imposing huge war reparations on Germany, creating a precondition for the radicalization of the masses, and then only by giving, giving, giving, giving, and giving, and giving, to the Germans enough force.
At the end of the 19th century, Rothschild's founding of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historic Judea with Jerusalem as the capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration already mentioned has created a prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, the first clashes began with the local Arab population.
Terrorist attacks have taken place on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, whether Hitler ran out of the chain on which he was initially held by international bankers, or all that he had done in the plan was difficult to guess, at any rate the suffering of European Jews in concentrations created a prerequisite for the acceptance of the Jewish state.
Israel was officially founded in 1948, and similar to Germany’s war reparations in World War II, the declaration of the State of Israel created a third-war focal point.
If international bankers succeed in disbanding it, the Jewish nation, like the other, will be the victims of the first line of battle, now together with the Arab or Muslim population of the Middle East in general.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of war and chaos not only within the country, but also internationally (let’s just take a look at how sharply people are divided into the supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is to blame and who is the victim of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where guilt produces guilt in an endless chain of violence, when at first the greed of individuals and their desire for global power stood?
Here it is necessary to distinguish the simple people of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers encourage people to choose in elections exclusively their own candidates.
The current prime minister of Israel, Netanyahu’s crane, is a typical example of a fascist, to international bankers loyalty, a policy that does everything to start a war with Iran, which, in view of Iran’s membership, would be a 20-year-old warrior to the Shanghai World Organization for Cooperation (China, India, India, Pakistan) and a two-month-old warrior to...
In what light now appears the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: “All we need is a general crisis and people will agree with the new world order.”
The New World Order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves the comfort of a handful of financial aristocracy.
A world where every newborn is implanted at birth with a chip that makes him a fully controlled being.
"And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to have a mark on their right hand, or on their foreheads, that they may not buy or sell, which is not worthy of the name of the beast.
This is to be understood: who has reason to count the numbers of that shell?
That number is the number of a man, and that number is sixty-six."
Argo: When It's Worst, Call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of demonstrating Islamist students occupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
They were to be released in exchange for the cast of Mohammed Réz Páhlavi, who fled to the United States after the revolution, who had been the patron of his regime for decades.
For the U.S. administration, the situation did not offer a positive starting point - she could not afford to jump overboard because it would so fundamentally jeopardize the trust of allies in other countries.
However, the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, was not possible.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later deepened the failure of the attempt to liberate the hostage force.
The detention of the diplomats was finally released after 444 days, after negotiations were mediated by the Algerian government.
Their destiny at home provoked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment.
Debakl in Iran contributed significantly to the loss of Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film, directed by actor Ben Affleck Argo, describes an episode of the story that brought America a small victory.
Just before the embassy was occupied, six employees fled the embassy.
After difficult peripheries, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in collaboration with Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, while helping the extravagant cover-up of the story – they went on Canadian passports as members of the film crew who watched the location of the country’s sci-fi movie.
Combination of Genres
The plan, devised by Tony Mendez' "exfiltration" expert, also required Hollywood's cooperation.
For the legend to be credible, a film project was written in specialized magazines, press conferences were held, a fictional production company had a real office.
Details of the operation have been hidden for a long time, the film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a realistically understood political thriller, at the same time the so-called "caper movie", the story of the released piece, a scam - an example can be a series of Danny's partners.
The film thus alternates moods - on the one hand the documentary sequence from Tehran (the title sequence shows iconic time photographs of events and the way in which the same situations were shown in the film - there are no big differences in that).
On the other hand, a lightened Hollywood passage, aligned with irony and mild excess.
And then the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions -- men dressed in clothes -- discuss the situation at the negotiating tables, in the hallways of the office, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has re-started his career in a remarkable way.
The smiling actor became a respected director and even his acting ceased to be the target of ironic notes.
Argo is his third full-length film, after the dark crime Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller City (2010).
At the same time, this is Affleck’s first film not to be filmed in the director’s home in Boston.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics that the director’s older films had elevated above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck also shows it in Arg, where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place in the streets, when reconstructing real events - the initial sequence of the embassy's fall is impressive in its clarity, which at the same time mediates the emotions of confusion and unpredictability that occur when it is cleared somewhere.
Affleck and his collaborators achieve a similar effect in the scenes of the fictional (false staff in the Tehran bazaar).
Too Many Events in Too Many Places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story told does not offer much in the film sense of exciting scenes.
She works quite successfully with this little thing, sometimes she thinks of reality - it doesn't work so elegantly anymore (a scene in which the threatening crisis at Tehran airport turns off phone calls in America, and the hunter after the ranch seems quite attracted to her hair).
The weakness of Arga, however, is the distraction resulting from the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charitable in the roles of Hollywood co-workers, but their characters deserve more space and are not the only ones in the film.
Affleck’s film loses a bit of dramatic momentum, it’s a film that can be watched with a mild interest, appreciate the realization and retro style evoking the thriller of the 1970s.
It's hard to break.
As a reminder of one still living history in some way and a proof of how exaggerated the notion of all-powerful and all-knowing secret services is, but it is enough.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.banknipoplaty.com, which annually declares the survey of the most absurd bank fee, has now decided to declare a contest for "the most absurd regulation or ideas from the EU workshop".
“It led us to the last event where the EU plans to adopt a 40 percent quota for women in the leadership of major European companies,” said Patrik Nacher, the right-wing organiser of the survey.
Among the nominated absurdities is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of Justice on the unification of insurance rates for men and women.
So far, women have been favoured in the price of life insurance, because they are objectively less risky for insurance companies.
"Another incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by people by the end of this year.
The vote will then take place by the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
The EU’s controversial regulation may also include the mandatory mixing of bio-components into fuels, which, as a result, is harmful to nature, and the prohibition of the use of reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain relatively small amounts of hazardous substances.
In the past, critics also faced a factual ban on the use of the term butter or the exclusion of classical bulbs from sales.
High-quality bananas should be 14 centimeters
The EU parliament often decides under the pressure of one or more commercial or industrial lobby whose demands in Brussels are usually defended by a state or group of states (the Czech Republic now threatens to veto the demands of its banks).
The interests of the lobby were also behind the fact that, for example, the highest quality bananas had to reach at least 14 cm in length in the Union and were not allowed to show a "normal curvature".
At the same time, the European Commission has defended itself by harmonising only the unified national standards that have complicated trade.
The EU’s fruit and vegetable standards have already been softened by the opposition of some countries, indicating that existing directives lead to food waste.
Last year’s EU regulation states that in the case of sold inflatable balloons, children under the age of 8 may not be inflated without adult supervision.
The EU has referred to a U.S. research that says balloons between toys are the leading cause of the death of children from suffocation.
Similar restrictions now apply to children under the age of 14 when digging into hiking trawlers.
Curious ideas are born at home
It is also relatively absurd that the rule concerning the European officials themselves - anyone who has an official role in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia in view of the sensitivity of the issue for Greece and must speak instead of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the Liberal Economist Association, Laissez Faire nominated the server for the survey, in addition to some of the absurdities mentioned above, such as the EU Food Stock Regulation in the territory of a Member State.
The EU has set the maximum volumes of food supplies that could have been located in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volumes set for canned buckets, for which it was threatened with a high fine.
The organizers of the survey also took the idea of paying some countries for not having a sea, and the idea of granting grants for a grant request.
But these ideas did not come about in Brussels, but in Prague.
"We're disabled because we don't have the sea.
We ask the European Union for a refund," said then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) in the autumn of 2004.
As an argument, he said that we were born with a lot of grain and as a result of so-called intervention purchases had to become full of warehouses that had to be exported.
For the fact that the Czech Republic continues to reach the ports, the EU should have paid us hundreds of millions of euros, according to Palas.
Finally, the European Commission rejected the Czech Republic by organising a tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Subsidy for the grant was offered to municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development, led by Minister Pavl Nedm (US-DEU), specifically to go to the drafting of a grant application from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are an exception
While Regulations are easily the subject of criticism in the Member States, EU efforts to regulate and at the same time improve the functioning and development of the Union as a whole deserve more recognition, according to a number of experts.
The more serious problem, for example, is that EU grants are drawn to projects that have nothing to do with deepening European integration, but which have been imposed by Member States in the budgetary negotiations.
The emotion among the Czech Republic is also aroused by the fact that, like other EU countries, the Czech Republic must fight for the right to specific labelling of its traditional products in Brussels, not always succeeding in this match.
The Czechs, after six years of fighting with the Germans and the Raku<0xC5><0xA1>anas, introduced the designation of Olomouc roses, but the local rum, whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, had to be renamed by our producers.
Rum designations can only be carried by products from the starch distillate, and not from sugar beet.
In the official list of EU-registered products, the world-renowned cheeses feta and gorgonzola, marzipan from Germany’s Lübeck or Parma ham have already been found, for example, Karlovy Vary dryers, mountain gourds and tr<0xC3><0xB8>bo<0xC5><0x88> capr and <0xC5><0xBD>atec chmel.
The EU trade mark can also be proud of the Pardubic pencil and bitter tubes.
People want me to save the republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura
Senator, how can a man attack a candidate for president?
It's not about being a senator or president.
If it worked without problems in our country, I’m not running anywhere.
But I can no longer see the country being robbed in the last twenty years, the thieves running here, the people increasing taxes and the retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don’t like, I try to find a way to change it.
And since I’m 40 and I’m an independent non-partisan, I have no choice but to be a senator or presidential candidate.
You got into the Senate, but you went to the castle.
Do you not turn your back on the people who chose you?
I've been saying all along that I'm going to fight for the Castle according to the outcome of the Senate elections.
I later clarified that if I was elected a senator, I would run for president.
My goal, however, is not a function, the function is a tool, how I can realize my vision.
That's why I need as much influence as possible and a strong mandate as possible.
The problem, however, is not only that we, as a nation, are in the pub and on television, but that we are going to beat anyone who wants to try to change.
Added to this are the media, which dishonesty man, and which weave the freedom of speech with the freedom to lie.
It was said that I was paying journalists or that I was an adviser to Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Paroubka.
Let's go to your visas.
You went to the battle for Hrad with the thesis of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and the return of property confessions of over twenty million.
To do this, you need to change the law.
As President, however, you do not have that authority, and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this?
When I, as a citizen, lobbyed for guidance to be a free trade, I managed to do so.
The problem is politics - when someone comes up with a good proposal to the right or left, the voters will refuse, and the citizens will be held back.
As an independent party, I have a much greater potential to get the support of all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that without party boxing and dogma, I can take something that is best for our country from every side and apply it.
Do you consider yourself a right-winger or a left-winger?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people rank me rather to the left.
It doesn’t matter to me if a little left or a little right.
It's important to me that we move forward.
I don't care if anyone belongs to the left or the right, but I want to connect people.
I will always support any public good solution, even if it is proposed by KS<0xC4><0x8C>M or ODS, and I will also be against bad ideas.
You make fun of yourself when someone says you’re a populist.
But don't you prove it by what you said?
When you create a business plan in a company, you also have some ideal goal and vision.
And you're trying to get closer to that.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I am talking about are already working in the world, or have been talked about by important experts.
But without the support of Parliament, you'll only have the passwords left.
You will not be able to do that in the long run in politics.
Or do you think that when you follow people and talk to them, you will be able to take on, for example, criminal and material responsibility?
I have no choice.
To persuade politicians, journalists, and the public, and to try to get them to our side to make it happen.
If I were elected president, there would be no problem in organising a television live broadcast where I would ask the presidents of parliamentary parties to legalize material and criminal responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And they might have to tell you why they don't want it.
If there is a strong personality who will name the misfortunes, it can be pressurized on the political scene.
Take the president's direct election, it was a merit of public pressure.
On the level, I say that I am an amateur, that I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and visions, I try to find allies.
I have just started in politics and I will try to get the majority support for my program.
I'm trying to move things on my own, if it doesn't work out, I'm gonna end up in six years and I'm going back to the private sector.
It sounds like Okamura is supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know I won't do anything in one person, so I've wandered around a number of famous people, whether they'd also run for the Senate.
I went after Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, which I refused because of the amount of work.
So at least I supported investigative journalist Jan Lorencova, who was disclosing scams with light heat oil.
I've been nominating that people are really dissatisfied, but now I'm in trouble.
Sixty percent of the people did not go to the polls, and those who went were mostly elected to the establishment’s representatives.
There are only two independents in the Senate.
People have appealed to the Senate in such a way that the changes will be difficult to enforce.
Yet I will fight for my visions, such as the direct choice of mayors or hetmans.
Are you considering setting up your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet, because I don't have time to check the clean past of every potential party, and I don't have money for it.
I don't have any money for the presidential campaign, there's only 20,000 on my transparent account.
You don't have the money?
Are you talking about asset confessions, what is yours?
I estimate private property at about <0x24>60 million.
I have land in Prague for about <0x24>25 million, apartment for <0x24>10 million, another apartment for <0x24>8 million, a collection of artworks for about <0x24>10 million, Aston Martin for <0x24>3.5 million, and <0xC5><0xA0>koda Superb for <0x24>1 million, and then I have a couple of millions on account.
By the way, I have the Aston Martin because it was my boy's dream - I always liked James Bond, who was in the car, was gallant about women and at the same time fought against bad and mischief.
You drive an Aston Martin, you have <0x24>60 million in assets and you don’t have the money to campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don't want to put your own money into it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have <0x24>15 million for the campaign.
Is that what I owe me?
I've already killed 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors proves that I don't think my program is that interested.
And I have no obligation to pay for my campaign.
The cost of the campaign will basically cover me what I'll get the senator's salary.
But I wouldn't experience it, for example, I couldn't pay my son for an English school that costs <0x24>30,000 a month.
If I just want to make money, I don't run anywhere.
So you're going to continue to do business so you can live?
Didn't you say you're shutting down these activities?
It has nothing to do with the salary.
As I promised, I partially suppressed my activities.
For example, my representative will be the organizer of the trip in the spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who will save the Republic.
But I also need to live from something.
How much as a businessman were you used to take monthly?
Two hundred to four hundred thousand, which I'm taking on.
And if I were president, I'd end my business.
The entire interview can be found in the Saturday edition of Law.
The architects of the MVRDV are proof that real adventures do not take place just in the head - for example, Spijkenisse and the recently built Mountain of Books - 2 pictures
"This building seems to me happy, it looks futuristic. Finally, there is something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, who walks around the edge of the road.
Stefan Spermon, IT technician at a nearby large company, says: "Of course, the house is nice."
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
They all have internet, iPads and e-books.
No one goes to any of these old-fashioned libraries nowadays voluntarily, right?
Spijkenisse, a location in close proximity to Rotterdam without its own job opportunities that are not even worth a visit, holds a special record.
This village with 80,000 inhabitants has the lowest level of education in the whole of the Netherlands.
To solve this stupid situation, a few years ago it was decided to contribute to public education and to build seven beautifully painted concrete miniatures of fictional bridges that are depicted on euro banknotes.
The success of the educational offensive, however, was in no way twisted.
And so the city councillors realized that there is only one way to become masters of statistics: we need to have a library!
Winy Maas of the Rotterdam Architectural Studio MVRDV, master of insanely bold column graphs and creator of funny, often even cynical buildings, accepted the matter with usual calm and at a competition in 2003 he appeared with five paws and paws on the floor.
And while the commission was still looking around and clapping her shoulders, Maas dared to make his presents to himself according to his size and ended his activistly justified speech with the words "Dear City Communities!"
So this is my proposal to the Mountain of Books in Spijkenisse, the so-called Bookenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain was completed for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million.
It is part of the revitalization project, which also includes underground parking, supermarket, post office and several adjacent residential and row houses with a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, the Book Horse was awarded second place "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
The small-town gray, which has not yet been able to offer more than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an unusually ugly town hall, behind whose white facade you would rather expect a dairy farm, is thus richer in a bit of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
A Long Road to the Book
First impression: reader's eldorado under the cover for cheese.
While the mass of the mountain is driven by an elevator, you will discover a true spatial and reader’s passion only when you walk through the topography.
From all sides, the glazed interior is bright and clear, the floor of burnt cabriolet and elegant street chandeliers clearly express the atmosphere of the public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You see the park benches, the dog and the boys and girls playing football.
Everywhere books, books, books.
"Normally, there are bookshelfs along the facade, and in the middle there is a large dark space, which is usually uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We built up the classic space configuration with our legs and pushed the reader’s space from the inside out.
The interior of the Mountain of Books is cleverly used: in the center are offices, internet library, chess club, ecological center and central home appliances.
Special comfort are black shelves for books, which are once coated with walls, once with a parapet and sometimes with a staircase.
The appearance, structure and smell are foreign.
Over the unknown building material, even architects and construction engineers will turn their heads.
“We wanted to work here with recycled materials,” says Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, in a question for Standard magazine.
So one day, in a French farm, we encountered a suitable waste product from agriculture.
For many years, it has been used in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands as a base under the roots of millimetre rono from synthetic matter.
It is cheap and time efficient.
The thin fabric lasts one, two seasons and then is ripe to be dumped into the bulky waste.
For the library, the rono - for the first time in such a quantity - was polished on boards of four centimeters thick.
With the effect of heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) colors into a dark, homogeneous and heavy-duty material that smells a little like a new car and a little like a sports shoes.
After 105 staircases you will reach the top.
At the end of the almost 500 meters long journey you will be rewarded in the literary cafe not only with fantastic views of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and figs in flowerpots.
They care about the atmosphere, but mainly about the right humidity in the mountains of the literature.
Gifts for a New Soul
“You might not believe it, but this house is, despite many glass surfaces, a demonstration project in terms of ecology,” says Trouborst.
It is heated and cooled with earth's heat.
Although the Mountain of Books stands under a glass lid, the sun only shines inside for a short time, even on sunny days.
Wide glued wooden vases, standing at the corner of the glazed façade, serve as a shade and capture much of the sun’s rays.
The air conditioning in the room is very pleasant.
The rest will be handled by fully automatic rollers.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptic from the IT industry, has already visited the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde, who even calls Boekenberg a "long-awaited soul" Spijkenisse.
Reason: Every city’s residents were invited to open a few weeks ago to dedicate a book from their personal fund.
Thus, the optical gaps should first be filled in a not fully equipped library, which currently reads 70,000 pieces.
The concept has proven itself.
The coffin is completely filled.
“There’s nothing worse than a half-empty library,” says architect Wina Maas.
“Thanks to our invitation, I think every citizen now has a certain relationship with the new home.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it was just on the deck.
In this way, the MVRDV succeeded in the royal discipline, which in the professional jargon is called the formation of identity.
Spijkenisse wrote the history of literature.
No matter how young and unskilled.
This is the starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans need to play a bigger role"
Germany abstained from voting on the decision to accept Palestine.
According to U.S.-Europe relations expert Stephen Szabo, the Berlin team is balancing on the narrow edge of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: Germany first signalled earlier this week that it would vote against the proposal for the observer status of Palestinians in the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained from voting.
- Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be cautious because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think it supports the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence – without being too critical of Israel, of course.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from voting on the establishment of a no-fly zone.
This is where NATO finally comes in.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear stance on serious international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
The reason is that it is changing its foreign policy, from a policy that was so-called controlled by the United States, to a German foreign policy.
The situation is even more difficult because Europeans do not have a coherent and coherent policy.
The Germans are between the two fronts.
They are expected to play an independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they're just getting old in their role, but they're on their way to a "normal" foreign policy.
To the foreign policy they have in France or in the UK.
What exactly does "normal" foreign policy mean from a German perspective?
It shows the willingness to engage in national interests and attitudes that are independent of the attitudes of the US or European partners.
I think that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. export and its relations with certain areas, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany’s economic interests are to some extent different from the economic interests of other powers, and therefore Germany has to protect its interests.
Did economic interests influence the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
First, Germany has a large settlement in the Middle East, especially in the countries around the Persian Gulf.
Therefore, it must be careful not to intimidate the public, but also the elites in the Arab countries.
It plays a role anyway.
But I don’t want to attribute too much importance to it, it’s not a completely unilateral relationship.
However, this plays an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany’s relations with the US been damaged when Germany abstained from voting on both important decisions, for example when voting on Palestine?
I think that in Europe and even in the United States there is a great understanding of the German attitude.
That is why I do not think it was as dramatic a break in the Libyan question.
I hope that Germany will gain some respect from it.
This indicates that he must be considered an international player and his interests must be taken into account.
There are different views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The United States, on the other hand, clearly vetoed.
Are there differences of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
These differences have always existed as a result of U.S. domestic policy.
I think that the Obama administration probably has a considerable understanding of the European stance.
But as a result of the political situation there, of course, this position cannot stand publicly.
I think the differences in opinions aren’t really as big as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, then Obama is not very enthusiastic about Netanyahu’s policy at all.
Is it not difficult for Germany to align its close relations with Israel and the US, on the one hand, and with the position of the most important partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that's exactly what makes it difficult for the Germans.
For the Germans, of course, it would be a little simpler if there were a coherent and coherent European policy, which is not happening at the moment.
They cannot therefore be part of a broader line and must instead push things forward from their own position.
That’s what they do with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will take on a leading role and will push Europe towards a European stance.
This is not easy for Germany, of course, because of relations with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive topic.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they must play an independent role.
Does Germany see itself in the role of an important international player? Does it want to take over the main role?
Or is the leadership role still difficult for Germany?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still unpleasant, and for obvious reasons it is still difficult to play a larger role for this country.
For example, when we look at the European crisis, every time Germany takes on a larger role, anti-German moods arise.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
It’s actually an old problem: we don’t want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
In this regard, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be acceptable for the most diverse neighbors and opinions and it is not easy.
The influence of the US in European politics is now constantly declining, but the EU is not currently filling this vacuum.
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, it's unpleasant to them and will make it even more popular - c'est la vie!

"Marketing Protection" in China: when Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world-renowned brand, Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
What is Armani Polo?
It is a trademark that is officially registered in China, but has nothing to do with the original company.
However, it enjoys protection for as long as it is not complained of by the real brand owners.
And even then, it is not clear whether the law will apply.
“It’s becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing’s office that specializes in violating protection rights in the Far East.
Every week a new case lands on my desk.
A few extra letters are enough for fakes to sign up for their brands.
For example, the Gucci brand will become Lu-Gucci and Prada-Kny will be registered instead.
In this way, German companies, such as the manufacturer of sports goods Puma, are legally copied as well.
Pattloch opens a registry with records of the marking office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company was allowed to protect the Zegna DF Puma trademark, an artificial name that parasites the fashion house of Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese are world champions in copying and infringing intellectual property.
In large cities, there are several-storey commercial houses where counterfeits are sold almost exclusively.
Pattloch’s cases, however, are different, and the mandate of his mandate is to prevent Chinese companies from receiving the full official right to use the marking, which is already protected elsewhere, from the trademark office.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", an associated brand.
This word refers to "Bang Dakuan".
That's what they call women hunting rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any culprits.
“It hurts the business, we have to scoff at it,” Pattloch says.
"The badge is diluted, the exclusive status disappears, the image damage is enormous."
The financial losses and legal costs of affected industries go up to millions, especially in the case of expensive sample products.
According to CLSA market research firm, China is the third-largest luxury commodity market with a volume of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 billion per year and the fastest growing market.
However, erasing suspicious records in the trademark register can be difficult and something worthwhile.
The procedure can last for up to nine years, with uncertain results.
Pattloch tells of cases where the court rejected the lawsuits, because the name he claimed became a "market reality" for a long time.
When the plaintiff has a complaint, he still has to pay the plagiarist for damaging his brand in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes there is the law of the jungle.
The known cases also relate to graphical elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, a company that recently took over the German pumping company Putzmeister.
The Chinese are still allowed to use an emblem that resembles a Mercedes star.
The company Geely, which bought Volvo, originally used a blue-white logo that resembled BMW. The dispute was settled, Geely had to change the logo.
The fashion goods manufacturer Lacoste lost in China with counterfeiters from Hong Kong and Singapore, who turned the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any culprits.
However, the CTMO Marking Authority admits that there were shortcomings in 2010 due to too little staff and space.
But last year, “the course of the work process has returned from the emergency situation to normal.”
For example, the number of unprocessed opposition proceedings decreased by 22 per cent.
57,000 of these cases were closed, 75 percent more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 complaints are still pending at the office.
Doing something against it is expensive.
As is often the case in China, these are impressive figures.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark protection applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
That’s a record, and that means China is running a list of new applications around the world.
This also applies to the number of all valid trademarks - there are a total of 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan were selected for fees.
To simplify this means that each login costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
There are several reasons to start a dispute against it, as the case of the German family-owned company Freudenberg shows.
The group has been fighting a Chinese plagiarist for more than seven years.
The Germans, however, achieved the cancellation of its illegal production of imitated car parts.
However, the counterfeiter continued to secure the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
We would forget about it ourselves, because names cannot be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO trademark office also rejected the Munich company’s objection.
In two other instances, Freudenberg has won the rights, but the opposition continues to fight in the dispute.
You have to be very careful.
The matter is now being discussed in the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident that the case will lead to a good ending and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "Driving is extremely expensive and costs us a lot of time, money, and nerves."
Internal costs cannot be calculated. In the company's archives, they even had to review the 100-year-old records to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the counterparty a "high six-digit sum in euros" to settle the dispute.
“You can see what it means to us,” Wentzler says.
The danger from the Far East is also threatening to affect Europe.
This is the case if the imitators provide unprotected brands.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer wanted to apply for the Freudenberg marking for shoes and leather in Germany.
This area of business has long been abandoned by the group, but it has been able to withdraw its registration.
“You have to be careful,” Wentzler says.
He and lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very cautious when trading with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights; rather, foreigners should “report everything that is worth protecting in any way, even in China,” says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg submits to the brand in the last act of his drama, then he will probably have to pay license fees on his own behalf, explains Wentzler.
Or we'll be pushed out of the contested segment.
World AIDS Day: Sniffing, Singing, Help
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi Congregation is testing – and in Swaziland, orphans after parents who died from AIDS are delighted.
The story of a connection that exceeds much more than 8733 kilometers.
First of all, there’s dip: cowboy high boots, basketball boots, women’s boats and men’s mocassins look for tact on the parkette and quickly find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then slowly the voices of the singers - alt, bass, tenor and soprano - are raised, moms and each other hunting.
29-year-old conductor Fiete Hopf almost lifts it from his textile boots when he combines his voices with his ferocious wild gestures.
It's Monday night. In the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Imbonggi choir is trying a new song.
There were 50 singers and singers between the ages of 23 and 69, from a researcher in human genetics to a native.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, each choral voice has a different text and, moreover, in a very foreign language - Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Self-Help Help
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS Programme, estimates that around 34 million people worldwide are infected with HIV.
Of these, 23.5 million live in South Africa.
There are 245,000 orphans in Swaziland after parents who died of AIDS.
HIV-positive is now more than 40 percent of the population.
For 180 orphans after parents who died of AIDS, the Voices for Africa association found patrons in Germany in the village of Esitjeni.
Seventeen of them attend a second-grade school.
You can take the patronage for 15 or 20 euros per month.
It guarantees a child’s school uniform, school uniform and one hot meal a day at Gogo Center.
Imbonggi in Zulu means "the storyteller" or also "the one who exalts."
No one can speak Bantu in this area, just sing.
For almost a decade he has practiced the choir of songs in this foreign soft language and sometimes he also brings them back to where they originally came from: South Africa.
At an air distance of 8,733 kilometres from Heidelberg, the village of Esitjeni is located in the northeastern part of the Kingdom of Swaziland, which is dependent on the voices of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected.
Approximately 2,000 people live there, some still in plain clay or mud houses. Most of them are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they have been infected with HIV.
Esitjen is seen in the smallest shadows of the whole of Swaziland: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy worldwide according to UNICEF.
The men’s precinct cut, which demonstrates to reduce the risk of infection by half, is not accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry the weakened immunity virus in them. It is not uncommon for them to die in under thirty years.
This village was discovered by a congregation on a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but first of all, the members of the Imbonggi saw many children on the streets, who were lacking not only parental care, but read everything: food, clothes, education.
Without high school education, they have no chance at all in a poor country.
Initially, it was still a private deployment of individuals, which allowed for a few euros a year to send the child to school and give him one warm meal a day.
However, a year later, the association "Voices for Africa" was founded, which has since taken care of orphans after parents who died of AIDS, almost professionally.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial SPIs include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
Common viral SPIs are HIV, human papillomaviruses, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Muscles and pruritus belong to the parasitic SPI.
Who is among the most affected people?
Syphilis and cappuccino occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute is based on the fact that at least four out of five cases of syphilis reported in Germany are transmitted by sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, they are sexually transmitted diseases that occur frequently, chlamydia infections, trichomonads, candidiasis (mycosis), cappuccino and human papillomavirus.
HIV is spread relatively little among heterosexual adults in our country, but about 20 percent of people newly infected with HIV belong to this group.
Chlamydia infections occur significantly more frequently among adolescents than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In addition, there are often human papillomaviruses among adolescents.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases need to be reported.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of people infected with syphilis has more than doubled from 1,697 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
The number of people newly infected with HIV has decreased since 2007.
In 2011 there were about 2,700 cases.
That's about a tenth less than a year ago.
What Symptoms Are Alert to Sexual Disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, difficulty urinating, rash, pain in the lower abdomen and bumps or warts.
However, they often do not cause any pain or other symptoms, and therefore remain unobserved.
How is it possible to protect yourself?
The risk of infections can reduce condoms, but they do not offer 100% protection.
Because the originators of sexually transmitted diseases can also be partially transmitted by infections from impurities and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations, especially in the case of frequent switching of sexual partners.
In case of early diagnosis, it is possible to cure most SPI and prevent later consequences.
Thanks to patronage, charitable gifts and, last but not least, to the honoraries that the congregation earns by singing throughout Germany, some money is being raised.
"We have already sent about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200,000 in total to Estonia," said Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
The money from Germany is managed in the village of Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident woman who can intervene.
It also ensures that orphaned children find shelter, for example, with some of the grandmothers.
Gogo, as old women call themselves in Zulu, is the base of the village.
Some of them also took 14 orphans, gave them a roof over their heads, and they make sure that the children get to school every day in uniforms on time.
Children who no longer have anyone go to a shelter to Khanyisile, a lonely woman who is paid by the couple as well as two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children a day.
"Voices for Africa" also founded a sewing school, built two chickens, and together with the U.S. health organization PSI arranged for many people in the village to take an HIV test.
It's not obvious. Even though the disease is so obvious in the whole country, everyone is silent about it.
King with 14 wives.
“AIDS is absolutely taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with sexuality.”
Actually quite strange in the country where the king officially maintains 14 wives.
The last absolutist monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his ruthless lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
The state-approved way of life is also responsible for the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades.
But also many migrant workers who spread the virus across the country.
Annette Lennartz says that while condoms are free in every corner, "but no one uses them.
“Culture is different – unprotected relationship.”
To support at least a little cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels once every two, three years together through South Africa and sings songs full of sadness, fighting, confidence in the future and self-confidence of the apartheid blacks who are many in the southern tip of the Black Continent.
The bus full of white people singing songs in the language of blacks - such an award brings not only mood and joy, but has already shed tears with many wild border soldiers.
The road always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit the children over whom they have patronage.
Although this village can hardly be found on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni river is more than known.
"Go to Esitjena, there's light," people say.
And when you go back to Heidelberg, which is an aerial beacon of 8733 kilometers from here, to the drowning singers in the test room on Bergheimer Straße, you can see that the light shines here too.
Messenger: NASA discovers on Mercury led
The Messenger probe has found evidence that Mercury is ice on planet Mercury.
The ice cap could be up to 20 meters thick.
The U.S. National Aviation and Space Administration (NASA) has demonstrated the existence of ice on planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the Sun, there is also ice water, according to three studies published Thursday by the specialist journal "Science".
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is an ice cap in the region of this planet, which lies in a permanent shadow.
It is said to be at least 30 centimeters tall and possibly up to 20 meters tall.
This water is believed to have come from comets or perhaps even asteroids that hit Mercury.
But let’s not just find ice related to the existence of life on this planet, said Sean Solomon, the lead scientist working on the Messenger probe.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help us explain how water and other essential elements of life have entered other areas of the solar system.
Sons, telescopes, and small robots like the Phoenix, unobserved aliens, participate in the exploration of the depths of the universe.
From time to time, images are sent to Earth, a small window into infinite distances.
The image comes from a photographic instrument developed by German scientists from the Max Planck Institute.

This cut from the Spitzer infrared image of the telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars. The oldest stars look like blue dots, less identifiable are pink-colored "newborns" in the birthplace of stars.
This region, where stars form — scientists call it W5 unromantic — was discovered by Spitzer’s telescope in the constellation of Cassiopeia at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This transformative beam of dying stars was captured by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The perforated ring is made up of material that the star has eclipsed during the process of dying.
In the giant Trifid Nebula, which is 5400 light-years away from Earth, a new star is formed from gas and dust.
The image of the galactic "beautiful" was taken by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The constellation of Pleiades, also called the "Seven Sisters", can be seen by the eye at night.

One of the largest and brightest images of the Hubble Telescope: a belief galaxy
Images of spiral galaxies become real artworks according to their coloring.
The European Southern Observatory has released a video showing a few thousand light-years away from the Trifid Nebula in the constellation of Sagittarius.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided into three parts, triangular), because the dark stripes of dust divide the burning heart of this star maternity into three parts.
In the constellation Haddonos, astronomers have photographed a prediction of a cosmic collision: 400 million light-years away from Earth, the female core of two galaxies colliding with each other and must inevitably come into collision.

This image was made up of optical and X-ray images of different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes that is 430 million light-years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, was recorded by Hubble's space telescope for NASA.
This larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
In this stellar mist is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The berth of the stars gives rise to ever-new increases.
These stellar clouds, associated with the Rosette Nebula, also give birth to new young stars, which are 5,000 light-years away from Earth.
In this brightly shining galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust yet, but only gas.
Scientists believe it originated only shortly after the Big Bang, when there was predominantly hydrogen in the entire universe.
Our Views of the Universe: The Most Important Telescopes
The telescope was allegedly invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, who used it to observe stars a year later before Galileo Galilei.
Since then, the optical telescope mirrors have been increasing – and the eyes they mediate are getting deeper and deeper.
The largest telescope in the world for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, was Hale's telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
The mirror in this picture had a diameter of five meters.
The Large Binocular Telescope is located in Arizona.
It allows you to look into the universe with the help of two mirrors, each of which has a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is huge. Only a mirror measures in diameter 10.4 meters.
The Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to reduce costs.
However, its diameter reaches about eleven meters.
Disadvantage of the inexpensive way of construction: the telescope is provided by a hook at an altitude angle, thereby limiting its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at an altitude angle.
Its peculiarity is the high amplification of the light flow.
This, despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror, equals the largest mirror telescopes in the world.
Using a radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, scientists in space are searching for extraterrestrial signals.
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) - the search for extraterrestrial intelligence - can help any computer owner who provides its computational power.
View of the Observatory of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
It stands here the Very Large Telescope - and honors its name.
This telescope with a total of four mirrors can illuminate even the medium infrared spectrum.
An extremely large European telescope is also planned at ESO’s Chilean Observatory.
Its main mirror is intended to be 42 meters full and is composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, the pictures can be counted first in 2018.
The two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world by 2007.
They offer immediately two mirrors, each with a diameter of ten meters.
Keck's telescopes are part of the Maun Kea Observatory, which also looks into space using the Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
A new giant telescope is also expected to be built on Mauna Kea - with a mirror diameter of thirty meters.
You can admire it here in the picture.
The most important impressions from space, however, are mediated by Hubble’s space telescope.
Records of distant worlds have been available to us since April 24, 1990.
The Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets since March 2009, especially those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1235 candidate planets had been detected since the start of the mission.
The image documents the last preparations before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space for the first time in 2018 on board the Ariane5 rocket.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to search for the light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists believe that there is also ice in the Southern Pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as Messenger orbits the planet far closer to the north pole.
Radar measurements have shown for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe, which was sent in 2004 and is the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now confident.

Searching for a track in a country where 97-year-old people are still relatively young.
The ride of the Talysh Mountains can be called wildly romantic.
A microbus runs along the road with many turns along densely forested hills, rugged rivers and simple rural buildings.
Everything is green and juicy, it almost seems we're in the Schwarzwald.
However, this is the southernmost part of Azerbaijan, and the border with Iran is only a few kilometres away.
There is a Caucasian ethnic group of Talysh, which is not very well known, except that it speaks perfectly Persian and Azerbaijani and is very old.
The final station is Lerik.
This town is home to too monumental Soviet-era architecture, which does not fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe do not travel here. Arrival from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too difficult.
For 323 kilometres it takes eight hours, because the road is only one-way.
The fairytale wealth, for which the country owes oil in the Caspian Sea, has not yet arrived here in the countryside.
Pilate Fatulajeva (48), however, is convinced that Lerik wants to become a tourist attraction.
"The Eurovision Song Contest was celebrated by Baku in May - and next year we will have the festival of the oldest people in the world," Fatulajeva says.
She is the director of the museum of longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is documented the life of almost eight dozen Taly<0xC5><0xA1>s from the surroundings, who are a hundred years old. Fatula's photo shows a black and white.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, she gave birth to a child.
The museum’s controversial star, however, is the shepherd of sheep Shirali Müslümov, who is allegedly 168 years old.
The birth certificate does not exist.
And since the oldest man with the documents was 122 years old, the age of the Muslim seems to be extremely questionable.
"He was born in this area in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulajeva explains.
The man was reportedly married three times and had 23 children, and at the age of 136 he said he still had a daughter.
Wasn’t he a Muslim at the age of a few years old?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, heard about flying people in Central Asia.
"In the West, many seniors live in some areas of China, Japan, or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "there are also extremely many very old men in Sardinia."
However, due to missing evidence, no scientific evidence of age can be provided, especially when the matrix is missing.
Every day a glass of dissolved butter
The fact, however, is that people in the area around Lerik experience the Bible’s age quite often.
There are currently 20 people who are over 100 years of age.
Why are there so many flying people in the South?
The Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special Talysh genes.
The director of the Fatuljeva museum, on the contrary, believes that it is in nutrition.
However, the fact that it is the calorie diet of Talysh people who love meat, bread and especially dairy products, and many of whom drink a glass of dissolved butter daily, is so healthy, from a bromatological point of view, it does not seem exactly credible.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? Rubaba Mirzajeva lives in Cengemiran, a small village near the town of Lerik.
At the age of 97, she is still relatively young at this geographical latitude.
Mirzajeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
He sits on the ground with a messenger who he unceasingly clings to.
Eight people live under one roof here, including one of Mirzajeva’s sons and daughter, both of whom have long been grandparents.
Two young children are also running around.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests, which is served in typical belly glasses "armature".
Mirzajeva’s white teeth form the perfect series and under the hat hides long dark blond copies, which her son proudly reveals before us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so I didn't like it and kept the color.
"I've never used shampoo either," says Mirzajeva.
A monthly pension is enough for life
She always ate only what came from her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, games.
I’ve never bought food in a supermarket in my life.
Then she tells me about her husband who was in the army.
It was the worst of the Second World War.
But everything improved when the room was taken over by "loved father" Gejdar Aliyev.
Propaganda sounds strange from an old woman's mouth.
However, the cult that is made around the figure of the father of nations who ruled his country as a dictator knows no borders in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, then his son Ilham took over.
Older people in Azerbaijan at least do not suffer from distress.
Mirzajeva receives a pension of 230 manat (approximately the same amount in euros) each month. This is a fee for the current ratios that can be used well.
And perhaps the long-time son of Mirzayeva is right: "Old people enjoy great seriousness in our culture."
They live in the middle of a big family, they are loved, cared for, and they are happy.

All of them, so far hopelessly divided in the confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of the "goods state" on the Nile, given to the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Mursi almost apologeticly said he had temporarily restricted the jurisdiction of the constitutional court and expanded his jurisdiction to "save the revolution".
But what a 61-year-old engineer, who has a doctorate degree at the American University in Southern California, really wants to save, the Egyptians don’t even know the world.
Should the judiciary be deprived of power?
234 paragraphs, which the Supreme Constituent Assembly with the predominance of Islamists accelerated in the fifteen-hour night marathon, are partly alarming.
As in previous constitutions, the proposal also states that jurisdiction is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does "principles" mean?
This was and is an interpretation, and it can be feared that Islamists use this vague formulation and the legal space associated with it for a stricter interpretation of the Sharia.
At least this is illustrated by the newly added paragraph: In all matters pertaining to Sharia, it is necessary to consult al-Azhar University, which is the country’s most important Islamic institution with great influence on the entire Sunni Islam.
This may not be necessary, but it may mean that the clergy will exercise oversight of the legislature, which would bring justice a de facto deprivation of authority.
There are many interpretations of the Constitution.
The problem is also that the civil jurisdiction of the military courts should continue to be maintained.
These courts served under Mubarak’s government to suppress the opposition.
After the fall of the dictatorship, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
As stated in the proposal, the state should also protect "the right of the essence of the Egyptian family and promote its morality and values".
This is legally formulated so inaccurately that with the help of this paragraph, state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature.
Understandably, it means nothing but censorship.
By the way, no paragraph defines explicit equality between men and women in writing.
Therefore, another paragraph prohibits the Hanoi of the Prophet Muhammad and his envoys.
However, it remains unclear what is haunting and how it will be prosecuted.
Similarly, the wording that "insulting people" is prohibited is doubtful.
Is it just a cartoon of the president or a joke at the expense of lawyers?
The matter of interpretation, like many others in this proposal, which Mursi will submit to sign and, according to his words, will be presented "very soon" to the Egyptians for the purpose of a popular vote.
“The Revolution Has Returned”
There has been an opposition to Islamist violence for several weeks now.
Tens of thousands of people gathered on Friday evening in Cairo’s Tahrir Square in an unusual lockdown and pledged to destroy the constitutional charter before it begins to take effect.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, who was third in the presidential election.
Nobel laureate and former director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed Baradej, said the draft constitution belongs to "the garbage of history".
Through the short-circuit service, Twitter accused Morsi’s supporters of wanting to run “against democracy”.
“If he declares a referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow it,” said opposition leader Jásir Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet punished," Egyptian media opposition politician Khalid Ali said.
Several judges have announced that they do not want to oversee the referendum, which would become invalid.
"The Qur'an is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood declared an opposition demonstration, but with caution, not on Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile in front of the Cairo University.
She was attended by many humiliated women and supporters of the Salafists, who shouted, "The people demand the application of God's law."
They called out to Mursi, "Clean the land!" and said, "The Qur'an is our constitution."
The struggle for supremacy over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would probably trigger a state of similar civil war.
Mursi’s supporters obviously didn’t want to risk it.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that both the opponents and supporters of the constitution’s proposal expressed themselves loudly and clearly.
Now is the time to let the people at the polling stations decide which direction the country should go.
The majority is in favor of the proposal of the Islamists.
"The word 'human rights' doesn't come up once."
The enforced constitutional dispute, which should in fact continue until February and integrate all social forces, is annihilating Hafiz Abu Sa'd.
Eighty-year-old human rights defender and the president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended members of the Muslim Brotherhood when they were behind Mubarak’s back in prison or standing in court.
Not because he shares their ideology, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
He was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And there are no words 'human rights' in the new constitution now," he complained in an interview with Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of Mursi's power to all three powers in the state has led this lawyer to resign.
These measures are a scandalous blaming against the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of the president strengthening civil society, he actually abolished it," Sa'da complained.
Without civil society organizations, however, democracy cannot work.
Sa'da feels abandoned and abandoned by the international community, which watches the fight of ideological factions on the Nile with a mix of curiosity and tension.
That could take revenge on him.
The protester on Tahrir Square warns: "You have created a monster you can no longer control."
The most scented fish in the world?
Five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country’s success be linked to the local appetite for extraordinarily scented fish?
Take a few over-mature cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of dirty and wet football equipment.
Let it lie for a week.
So you get their paralyzing scent of rakfisk, one of the biggest Norwegian delicacies.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow here, a wonderful view - and the odour all over the place hangs in the air.
A crustacean is a salty squid that has been wet in the water for up to a year - it depends on how much you want the fish to smell.
As it darkens and it starts to get cold, the Norovs here in Fagernes begin to meet at a festival dedicated to, as you say, the best, the most inspiring food.
"You dream it raw and then you drink it with a glass of aquavite," says Havard Halvarsen, a local professional firefighter, but also the so-called "Rakfisk General", who is responsible for the festival.
Everywhere around us, people eat small pieces of fish and drink large amounts of alcohol.
"Some people prefer aquavits rather than foxes," says Havard.
The drink can override the smell.
I'll try a few pieces.
If the fish can avoid your nose, it's not so bad - it's like a piece of sushi that was on the long way by bus.
Rakfish is a product of a very different time when there was poverty in Norway, and because there were no fridges yet, the fish in the autumn were poured into airtight vessels with water and salt.
Then in the middle of winter, when they were well suffocated, pulled out and eaten - the senses were undoubtedly suffocated with alcohol.
Just one generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country and look for work, mostly emigrating to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly – more than 13% of immigrants are attracted to large amounts of work, high wages and a large system of care.
The inhabitants of Sweden, an old rival who was much richer than Norway recently, run into the country for work.
It is seen as an important, indispensable, though relatively fragrant part of the Norwegian past.
It is one of the most expensive foods on the market.
Even though everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you 9 pounds (14 dollars) per piece.
Norway is often not included in global reports – and most of the population seems to be doing so.
The name of Anders Breivik, a right-wing racist extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year, is still mentioned here with displeasure.
Instead, the shooting is called "the July 22 incident".
The Norwegians can hardly believe that in their peaceful country one of them was capable of such brutality and murder.
Norway’s current wealth lies in the growth of one of the world’s largest oil and gas industries since the early 1970s.
"But oil isn't the only reason we're doing so well," says our waitress Anna, who with her long blond hair and surprisingly blue eyes represents a prototype of Nordic well-being, while serving plates with a lying fox.
We are, as you say, decent people.
Its English, as well as the English of most people here, is completely flawless.
We don't show up, we don't like showcasing.
Norway is very cautious about its oil wealth – besides a small percentage, most of the money from this sector is invested in a special fund for future generations.
When all the others, in the years leading to the global financial collapse, were throwing away money they didn’t have, the Norse had the ropes firmly tightened in their city.
"As long as we can ski in the winter and go for excursions in the summer, we are happy," Anna says.
"And eat foxes," he adds with a carefree smile.
I'm standing in the snow on the front for something to eat - I've got enough of the box.
Such a hamburger is definitely something else and is beautifully juicy.
But the smelly fish is back in the evening.
The hotel I live in is one of the many places where ragfisk is served for dinner and where guests choose the best, or rather for their most demanding fish.
They're connected to a live TV broadcast in which the moderator with the butterfly is surrounded by plates with ragfisk.
It’s like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thore-Juergene?"
"Here's our score, Havard."
It's called applause and laughter.
A man will fall from the chair, perhaps capable of aquavity.
Or maybe the evaporation of all these fish.
Enrique Pena Nieto from Mexico has a hard start
As Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take over the office, Will Grant from the BBC looks at the challenges he faces and the mixed expectations of his fellow citizens.
Transportation in Mexico City is particularly bad at the moment.
In the city, which is cluttered even in the best times, steel barriers were erected closing several key routes to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
The goal, however, was not to prevent people from getting to work, but to prevent protesters from approaching parliament.
On Saturday, the new President of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the Presidential Sherpa and take over the leadership of the nation.
He's faced with a challenging task.
Mexico did well economically at the time of Felipe Calderón’s resignation, but is in the midst of a drug war that has already claimed 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a big commitment to the Mexican people in reducing violence," President Pen Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama at the Oval Labor Labor earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve this goal.
Before he shook hands with the U.S. president, President Pena Nieta gained political experience as governor of his home state of Mexico.
The views on the new leader are also different in his old homeland, the orphaned state and the vast state surrounding the capital.
A straight man.
For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo they remember him in good.
Citizens attribute it to the development of tourism in the resort and the construction of infrastructure.
You can now reach the city by one of the new highways that Pena Nieto has built. These highways are a huge improvement compared to the bustling and bustling roads that used to be here.
The boards with his name also hang on the walls of a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
“We expect it to bring a real and lasting change,” says friend and political ally Gabriel Olver Hernandez, a state MP for President Pen Nietzsche, the Party of the Institutionalized Revolution (PRI).
In particular, we hope for the interesting and real changes in the area of security and the economy that our country so desperately needs.
After uninterrupted 81 years in power, the PRI party was pushed out by Vicente Fox.
Member Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, much is expected within the party from Enrique Pen Nietzsche.
And he refuses to express the opposition characterizing the new president as a person with no material content.
He is a very straightforward man, very interested in the excellent vision of the country.
He's a great statesman, and most importantly, he's a man who can listen.
But on the other hand, this is not the impression that many people have from their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the steep streets of Valle del Bravo cannot be more obvious.
Punched under highway cliffs in many ways resemble the suburbs of Mexico’s capital city.
And the problems in self-governing communities are also persistent and urban.
Earlier this year, the army was called to help cope with drug gangs operating in neighbourhoods, particularly inflammatory violence against women.
In the last two years alone, dozens of murdered women have been buried in empty places next to a huge garbage dump.
At the time when Pena Nieto was governor, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico, which is much more than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez – a place that is synonymous with the murders of innocent women.
In the better case, critics of Pen Niet say he failed to adequately deal with the problem of women’s murder while working in the office.
And in the worst case, his leadership accuses him of closing his eyes.
In a concrete house, typical of the downtown district, Irinea Buendia shows me the photographs of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna and suppresses the crying.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that her partner murdered her.
“When I arrived at her house, it looked like someone was washing her body,” recalls Mrs. Buendia.
There were marks on him after the strokes, and post-mortem stiffness has already begun.
As her mother tells the story, Mariana looks down from the picture on the wall, right next to the cross, with the only word on it: "Justice".
However, this is, as the family says, exactly what has been forgiven them.
The state authorities treated me as if I were an old lady, a troublemaker, and a priestess.
They want you to just accept what they say and shut up.
"But it can't be right when there are so many mistakes and omissions," he says.
Sherpa, which President Pena Nieto will receive on Saturday, is accompanied by a great deal of responsibility.
In the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been hit by violent crime and the new president has promised that during his tenure in office, he will be his priority.
"I hope he will be the same president as he was the governor," said Olvera, a member of parliament in Valle del Bravo.
But that is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza are most afraid of.
Bradley Manning Not Complaining About Mishandling, Military Prosecutor Says
The military prosecutor tries to refute Bradley Manning's claim to gross detention.
The hearing focuses on Manning's stay in a military detention facility in Quantico, Virginia.
The defendant wants the case to be rejected on the grounds of gross treatment of Manning in prison.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents.
The military prosecutor is trying to prove that Soldier Bradley Manning, who is accused of the largest leak of secret material in U.S. history, has missed many opportunities to complain about the brutal treatment he allegedly suffered in military detention.
Military prosecutor May Ashden Fein at a cross interrogation of Manning's army at a preliminary hearing in Ft. Maede, Maryland claimed that the records of weekly visits that Manning had with unit officers during the nine months of his detention, will not be bound for a detention in Virginia.
The cross-examination, which took place during the hearing on a defence proposal, to reject the case brought against Manning for gross treatment at the time of the detention, which is itself a sufficient punishment, took place the day after Manning witnessed the detention.
A military intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents while serving in Iraq.
The material was then published online on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of her information.
At the Friday hearing, the military prosecutor Fein, along with Manning, passed a form that officers had filled out after meeting Manning in a prison in Quantico, where he was held under increased guard from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein asked him about these forms on Friday, Manning admitted that the treatment by his guards was "excellent" and the overall treatment at the facility was "very professional".
Forms do not show any complaints of ill-treatment, although Manning’s officers directly asked how he was treated, Fein said.
Manning replied that he expressed his concerns about various problems orally and that the officers who visited him spoke to him about these concerns and indicated that they would deal with them, but they did not notice these problems.
"They had 'no problems' (after discussing concerns), and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't mention them," Manning said.
Judge Denise Lind also asked Manning why he hadn’t complained about dealing with his person in January 2011 at a meeting with a committee assessing suicidal thoughts, which he expressed a few months earlier in the form.
Manning replied that during this meeting, his intention was to achieve a reduction in the "injury prevention" regime.
The army said it had used this restrictive regime (one degree under surveillance due to suicide) to protect it and the safety of others.
“I wanted the inmates to know that I was okay and that I wanted to abolish this injury prevention regime ... so I could enjoy the improved quality of life as I saw it here,” Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday of his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained almost two months before being transported to a prison at a naval infantry base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he was considering suicide in Kuwait, and that one day he was down there because of the heat.
He said that he was not allowed to know what was going to happen to him and what was going on in the surrounding world was very conspicuous.
"My world has only died at the Arifjan base, at that cage," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
Manning said that after arriving in Quantica he spent most of the days (at least 21 hours, but often longer than 23 hours) in small cells without any company.
Manning said he was only allowed one mattress, a blanket, calls, some clothes and glasses.
He said he was trying to walk because sleeping or just lying down was against the rules during the day.
Manning said he always slept with light from the outside of the cell in his eyes.
He said that if the guards could not see his face as he turned to the other side at night, they woke him up and had to turn back.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint with soldier Manning in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
On Friday, Judge Manning was also asked about the charges, which he raised in a Thursday statement, regarding the fact that after being forced to sleep one night in his cell in Quantico naked, he was also forced to stand naked in front of guards and other fellow prisoners in the morning counting.
Manning said he was not allowed to cover himself with his lid when he was counting.
At the hearing on Friday, Judge Manning said that he believed, by order of his guards, that he had a cover which he could conceal, but admitted that no one had given him an order to postpone it.
Manning said on Thursday that he was forced to sleep naked last night because he tried to prove to the officer that he was not dangerous.
Manning said he told the officer that he could use a belt from his underwear or his calls to hurt himself, but he didn't.
Manning said that night his underwear, rings and glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyer hopes that the judge will take into account his experience in the course of his detention and that, in the case of his testimony before the military court, which is expected to begin at the beginning of next year, his punishment will be significantly reduced.
The defense said it was planning for Manning to plead guilty to lower criminal offences and to fight against other charges because they are too extreme.
The start of the hearing is scheduled for this week, it is expected that the military prosecutor will defend the conditions of detention as legitimate.
The Pentagon said Manning had been detained in accordance with regulations relating to all detainees held in custody with maximum security.
The charges against Manning include aiding the enemy, illegally causing the publication of intelligence documents on the Internet, the transmission of information relating to national security and the theft of public property or records.
If he is charged at all points, he can be sentenced to life.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
It says that many people have been forced to leave Mexico due to the insufficient opportunities that are there.
The Mexicans have a tendency to blame those who left; they remind them of difficult times, he says.
Navarrette says that Mexican Americans are lapped between two worlds.
On my last trip to the capital of Mexico, I barely got through the crowd and arrived in the immigrant agency area where I encountered a problem.
The arrows pointed to one of two fronts: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans") and the other for "Extranjeros" ("Chinese").
I stood there for a few seconds and didn’t know where to go.
I grew up in Central California and I've been called "Mexican" my whole life.
It's an ethnic abbreviation, the same as when my friends in Boston call themselves "Ireland" and my friends in New York call themselves "Italy".
So later I ended up labeling "Mexican American."
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather’s home, there was no need to use shortcuts.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, good enough to handle both sides of the conversation in this language.
But I don’t have the vocabulary of a native speaker and I can’t get rid of the American accent.
So I pulled out my American passport and stood on the front for "Extranjeros".
I was thinking about the moment this week when Mexican President-elect Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama’s White House.
On the program, they had the usual issues that are discussed when the leaders of the two countries meet: immigration, drugs, and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans are as likely to stay in Mexico as they are traveling to the United States.
He wants to join the United States and Canada and create a trade bloc similar to the European Union in North America.
And Pena Nieto promised to continue the Mexican war against the drug cartels, even though he did not provide any details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of hostile feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought of the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders under threat of arms to rewrite half of Mexico’s territory to the United States.
But for Mexicans who think in the span of centuries, not minutes, the remarks are omnipresent.
So a minute after the U.S. representative says something a little bit critical about Mexico, you will hear in the Mexican press and among the complaining elite about how Americans interfere in the sovereignty of their neighbor.
And the children of Montezuma will cross the war path.
And yet for Mexico, the real challenge is the relationship with more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Do you want to talk about hostile feelings?
There's a lot of them.
There are winners and defeats in Mexico, people that the country offers opportunities, and others that don’t.
The only reason why so many people with Mexican roots live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at some point in our family tree there was a person, perhaps a parent or grandfather, who was denied the opportunity to trust him in Mexico.
And more often than it would seem, this person corresponded to the profile - dark skin, poor education, origin from poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not against Mexico.
And even if we now live the American dream, we go to good schools and we have a good job, we can never forget the fact that we live the American dream, not the Mexican one.
Our identity may sometimes be vague, but our loyalty is not.
It's against the United States.
Moreover, we are aware that many of the elite Mexicans who belong to the ruling class do not like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats and they see us as a subordinate race that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our attachment to Mexico will never be strong enough.
Our existence is, in their opinion, only about failure.
If our families hadn't settled in Mexico, they'd never have left her.
And we would not now find ourselves trapped in a silk curtain, with a good life in the United States, but still with lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally travelled to the United States in childhood, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans understand who they are more, and Mexican Americans do not like to carry it.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she sees herself as part of two countries.
And at the same time, many Mexican Americans I know don’t feel like a part of either.
We love listening to Mexican bands, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You get the best of both countries, but you don’t have roots in one.
In Mexico, they look at us as Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And to make relationships even more complicated, some Mexican leaders and part of the intelligence, as I learned on my trip, want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work for Mexico as “provisional ambassadors” and represent Mexican interests in the United States.
We should tell our American citizens how great it is to visit this country, and we should press on political leaders to build relationships with Mexico.
Oh, no.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many hostile feelings.
And because of income inequality and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us are not sure that this is a great country.
I feel like it's up to you, amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are unwilling to forgive the United States what they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still feel unwilling about the way their subordinates were treated.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexicans" than I thought.
Old Battles, New Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could still be an uncertain foundation for peace.
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The next round of bloodshed suggests that every such incident is futile.
Among the usual unnecessary agreements about who started it, many buildings were turned into pieces, killed more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis. And for the first time, rockets from Gaza near Tel Aviv, the Israeli metropolis, and the city of Jer.
But even though Israelis and Palestinians seem to be trapped in their long-standing conflict, the Middle East is changing all around them.
The Arab Spring has changed the old order and Palestinians and Israelis, whether they like it or not, are caught up in the chaos in the region.
Maybe this will make their fight even more bloody than ever before.
However, there are reasons to think that this may interrupt their deadly pathological situation.
A war that is neither won nor lost.
At first glance, there are not many reasons for optimism.
Even if the ceasefire closed on November 21st lasted, this week’s fighting reinforced cranes on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic Movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will say they forced the Israelis to retreat even though Gaza suffered a defeat.
Despite the killing of several Hamas leaders and the closure of 1.7 million Gazans in one of the saddest and most populous corners of the planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
And indeed, Hamas is gaining influence on the West Bank, another piece of Palestine, which is currently ruled by its intrigued rivals from Fatah, a more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, Hamas leaders can very well believe that time is on their side.
Islamists across the Arab world gained greater influence, so Hamas gained powerful and wealthy friends.
Turkey, a revived regional power that once was Israel’s closest Muslim ally, joined Hamas, as well as Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.
Hamas is said to be surrounded by Israel, north of Lebanon, where Hezbollah's party/military rule over Syria, where rebels, who increasingly cling to Islamism, may sit at the crossroads of Bashar al-Assad, and Jordan.
And above all, on the southern wing of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt, by far the most populous and influential Arab country, has changed the equilibrium in the region.
Husni Mubarak, a secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had no time for Hamas.
On the contrary, Brotherhood is the brother of Hamas and its leaders are more influential in public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas may appear as a player that cannot be excluded either by Israel or the United States.
On the contrary, the Israeli supporters of the hard line come to the opposite conclusions.
In military terminology, Hamas was put back in the box.
The Israeli anti-missile system Iron Dome proved its price and many Hamas missiles were destroyed.
Israelis can sleep better - for a moment.
In diplomatic terminology, America is as unwavering as ever, and many European countries have blamed Hamas for launching the last round of violence.
And most importantly, Israel prospered, especially under Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, who largely ignored the peace process.
Although Gaza’s rockets have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been fairly calm from suicide bombers, partly thanks to the wall that interferes with the West Bank, the main part of what may once be a Palestinian state, and protects the right of the state against the Jewish settlements.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party joined an even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman at the start of the January 22 election campaign, is in a good position.
Why smear those pro-Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If they really ruled the West Bank, wouldn’t they fire missiles like their countrymen in Gaza did?
It'll be better if we hold them behind that wall and squeeze them when they pull their heads out.
Perhaps supporters of the hardline will win, but the Arab Spring can change their calculations.
Although the Islamists who are gaining power in Egypt and other countries do not have Israel too much in love, their main priority will be to deal with domestic problems.
Israel’s defense spending is higher than all its four Arab neighbors combined.
The start of a new war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to heal their economy.
The fact that President Mursi has worked with President Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire is a good sign and can mean the beginning of something new.
The Israelis should also look at the situation in the long run.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world is becoming more democratic, it creates a violation of Palestinians’ right to self-determination with a gunpowder that must one day explode in Israeli-occupied areas – just like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv last week.
Already today, the repressions are weakening democracy in the Jewish state, and the demographics are aggravating this situation as the Arab population grows.
The bloody attacks against Gaza that are taking place every few years to suppress Hamas will increasingly pick up a diplomatic tax.
Both sides need external incentives.
The answer is what intelligent people on both sides, most of the outside world, and these newspapers say: two states where Israel will transfer territory for security reasons.
In the short term, there is a bit of hope that a ceasefire will give pressure from the outside at least a little more influence on the enforcement of this thing.
Egypt, which, together with Turkey and Qatar, must take action to stop arms supplies to Gaza, has a better position than ever before to persuade Hamas to adopt the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders with the exchange of parts of the country and shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs outside must also press for a deal between Hamas and Fatah.
That would do more to create a Palestinian state than the immediate offer of virtual state sovereignty at the UN.
President Obama also has his part on how to get Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first election, he neglected to present his own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House, he seems to be just as shy in his entry into the process.
This is unfortunately short-sighted.
America has a vital interest in the stable Middle East.
This means a peaceful settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, the law on ugly cigarette packaging has come into force.
The odd green boxes, which are the same for all tobacco brands, are shown warnings for smokers and sick parts of the body.
Australian laws on ugly packaging of tobacco and cigarettes, the first of their kind in the world, have come into force, and the logo and colors of the brands have been replaced by general olive-green boxes with disgusting images of sick parts of the body and the display of infants and newborns with disease.
In addition to various health warnings and pictures, the only difference between the boxes of brand names that are printed in the same small letter is mandatory from Saturday.
This is the world’s strictest tobacco packaging regime.
The Australian federal government claims that the goal is to deter young people from smoking by removing this habit from their attractiveness.
Studies show that if people don’t start smoking by the age of 26, there’s a 99% chance they’ll never start smoking.
"Even in very young children, you can see that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to sell them along with their product," says federal health minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have shown that children are joining the crown in the logo with the mouse.
While Australia has one of the lowest number of smokers in the world and the changes will have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering taking similar measures.
The tobacco industry has strongly lobbied against the introduction of these laws.
Tobacco companies have claimed that this law will increase trade in the black market, which will lead to cheaper and more affordable cigarettes.
"This legislation will have serious unintended consequences," said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Forgers from China and Indonesia will bring much more of these products, which will be sold on the Australian streets.
Others claim that the laws have increased their trade.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that the demand for silicone cigarette packaging to cover up disgusting boxes, two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco Coat, Philip Morris Coat of Arms, and Japan Coat of Arms for Tobacco
She said Zico sold nearly 6,000 units to wholesalers and expects new stocks.
It's a good deal for us.
As a possible hint, experts point to the popularity of social media in the demographic group to which the plan focuses.
Under a series of Australian laws banning television advertising, sponsoring sporting events, and requiring most sellers to hide cigarettes from direct viewing, tobacco marketing moved online.
Australia has banned online advertising by local companies and websites, but it cannot restrict foreign websites.
“If you’re a marketing worker in the tobacco industry and you only have this small space to promote your products, the online space is the insurmountable place you want to be,” says Becky Freeman, a researcher in public health at the University of Sydney.
Ms. Freeman noted an increase in ratings of brands on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, conducted by "average Honz".
We have to ask ourselves, is it just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and got a job and created this video, or is that what a marketing company is involved in?
British American Tobacco Australia says the industry has focused on how to enforce new regulations rather than marketing.
The sector has gone so far that it has paid Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for attacking new regulations - countries within the World Trade Organization declare that trade is unfairly restricted, despite the fact that none of the countries with Australia is significant.
The implementation of the SOO decision is expected in mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek says the government has held talks with other governments that are considering similar laws regarding packaging.
Canada was the first country to introduce mandatory warning photographs in 2001.
It has now expanded to more than 40 countries including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The stricter laws are considered by the United Kingdom, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
There are a lot of smokers in Australia.
The pictures don't have any effect on me.
I'm just ignoring them.
"Just pull out a cigarette and put the box back," Victor El Hage says when buying a box with a picture of the tumor in his mouth.
Honestly, there's only one reason I quit smoking, and that's my little daughter.
James Yu, who owns the King of the Pack traffic in downtown Sydney, claims that the single boxes make it harder for him to level in the shelves.
"It took me an hour to set up the charge, now it takes me four hours," Yu said.
"The government should just ban them completely, then we'd say, 'OK, it's over, we'll close the bar," he said, deciding with his hands.
In a world of constant connection, it's not so bad to be bored
The last Thanksgiving day I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So we had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Waiting half a day at the airport for the next flight is pretty annoying, despite the distractions of books, magazines and iPhones (not to mention duty-free stores).
But some scientists and children’s development experts are increasingly coming with praise for boredom.
They say that it is good for us (and our children) to get bored sometimes.
It forces the brain to go in interesting directions, which can support creativity.
And since most of us are constantly connected to a screen these days, we don’t have a chance to enjoy the boredom.
Should we support boredom?
Yes, I do.
Oh, no.
But I'm going back to that.
Firstly, like many people, I assumed that boredom is a relatively new phenomenon, which occurred with the advent of more free time.
But as Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, who is the author of Boreddom: A Lively History (Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, it has a long history of boredom," he said.
On the walls of Pompeii was found a Latin inscription concerning boredom dating from the first century B.C.E.
And then there is also the question of how we define boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After looking at the research literature and presenting the idea to the target group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience “I wanted to do something that would satisfy me, but I wasn’t able to.”
Boredom differs from apathy in that a person is not involved in anything but wants to be.
He says there is no coercion in apathy.
He says the core of boredom is "a disturbance in the process of attention associated with a bad mood and a feeling of slow running time."
Boring can resemble a lot of depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they may have a relationship, boring people tend to see the problem as the environment or the world, while people who are depressed see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we’re bored when we’re just having trouble concentrating.
In her study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in Perspectives on Psychological Science in September, Professor Eastwood and colleagues pointed to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape on which the person read an article from the magazine.
Some groups heard a loud and unrelated TV show in the adjoining room, others heard it so quietly that they barely noticed it, while the third group did not hear it at all.
Those who heard the TV show quietly reported more boredom than the other two groups – they had difficulty concentrating, but were not sure why and attributed these problems to boredom.
When you’re trying to focus on a difficult or engaging task, distracting attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you’re doing something boring, “such as looking for the wrong components on the factory line, distracting music can help you not get bored.”
In fact, he said, we now know that twisting and sneezing, which are often seen as a sign of boredom, can actually help fight the boredom and keep people physically more attentive.
“The study shows that children who are allowed to spin learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit quietly,” said Professor Fenske.
We've all experienced boredom sometimes - the delay of my flight, the dragging speaker, especially the lengthy film.
But some individuals are more likely to get bored than others.
To help measure boredom in the 1980s, scientists developed the Boredom Proneness Scale.
The staircase includes questions such as: "Many things I have to do are repeated and are monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do them all."
Using these scales, scientists found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially when it comes to the need to have more and different external stimuli.
Teenagers, however, are generally inactive.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32 percent of teens reported being bored in school and doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they were not at school.
3% of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he does not know whether the percentage expression of boredom would be 21 years later, higher or lower.
However, he said he knows that "adolescence is the peak time for boredom", which is largely due to the fact that children and young people are not given much control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question: "Is boredom good for you?".
As research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form it can lead people to undergo absurd physical risks, play gambling, or abuse addictions as a way to mitigate it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discussed the connection between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has studied the problem for more than two decades.
“Boring is the brain’s way of telling you that you should do something else,” said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at NYU.
But your brain doesn’t always know the best thing you should do.
If you get bored and use this energy to play the guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
However, if you watch TV, it will only make you happy for a while, not for a long time.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he won’t be bored anymore, but he won’t learn how to have fun alone or drive alone, Professor Fenske said.
And "this separate procedure is transferred from one situation to another," the professor said.
Your child will not only learn how to have fun on his own, but will gain greater self-control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate boredom.
But we shouldn't be too critical of her either.
Our goal should rather be to feel comfortable when we are at the reach of continuous drowning of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
"We blame her for the need to get bored even more, but boredom is a painful, restless desire to be associated with something meaningful," he said.
What people are actually looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy your free time.
"In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated," he said, "it's hard to find ways to have fun when the noise goes off."
There is no manual in Colorado regarding the new marijuana law
Nineteen-year-old Anthony Orozco, a college student and footballer from Southeast Colorado, faces charges of crime for something that will soon be legal across the state - for holding a few grams of marijuana and the cigarettes he used to smoke it.
Mr. Orozco said that one day in September he went with several friends to Lamar, on the plains near the border with Kansas, when he was stopped.
After the policeman found marijuana in his car, Mr. Orozco was summoned for possession of drugs and equipment for drug use - minor offences with a fine of <0x24>100 for each one - and he was given a court date.
"They treated us like criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But is he a criminal?
In the uncertain weeks following the Colorado vote on the legalization of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the response of hundreds of minor drug cases depends on the spot rather than on the law.
Hundreds of cases of marijuana detention offences have already been cancelled here and in the state of Washington, which has approved similar measures.
The police department has stopped accusing adults aged 21 and older of holding a small amount, which will be legally allowed after the law enters into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in more conservative districts of Colorado have said they will continue with existing cases of marijuana, and are still accusing people of detention.
At the same time, several cities from the suburbs of Denver are voting towards the Western Mountains to prevent the opening of new state-licensed marijuana stores in their municipalities.
"This case is evolving so fast that I don't know what's going to happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, a police chief in the town of Aurora, east of Denver.
The heads are also smashed by regulators in the state of Washington.
And they are looking for instructions on how to set up a licensing system for growing, producing, distributing and selling - all by December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether good or bad, is in front of most states regulating marijuana, first for medical use and now recreational.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State licensing council.
But as Mr. Smith has admitted, no place or system can do more than suggest what might work.
"There's no real precedent that we could be guided by," he said.
The Washington Act, called I-502, comes into force on December 6th, which also leaves a yearly vacuum during which there will be no state licensing system yet, but legal holding yes.
And there are clumsy mechanical issues that need to be solved during this time, such as how to balance the state directive on "appropriate access" to licensed marijuana with its ban on cannabis trade within 330 meters of schools, parks, children's playgrounds or children's playgrounds.
“Nowhere will it be more difficult to place a licensed cannabis trade than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area,” said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently founded research group.
On November 21, Oates, a police chief from Aurora, sent an e-mail to his officers informing them that the city prosecutor would no longer be prosecuting offences for holding a small amount of marijuana in the custody of any citizen aged 21 and that the police would immediately pay for it.
Chief Oates said the police would enforce city laws regulating medical marijuana growers and would continue to prosecute drug dealers and dealers.
In Weld County, in northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck is a stricter view.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to prosecute cases of marijuana detention, mostly as a way to pressure users to seek treatment.
Currently, 56 grams or less of marijuana is being held by 119 people, although many of them are facing further charges.
"Our office is obliged to prosecute criminal charges that were criminal offences at the time they occurred," Buck said in a statement.
The reaction was also complicated in places such as the rural district of Mesa, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the district, no longer blame adults for holding small amounts.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supports this decision, but has also decided not to reject all ongoing cases of detention.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time continuing to enforce law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, bringing recreational marijuana into the hands of the government and the legal system will never be easy.
And the contradictory reactions across the state, in view of this great state-green experiment, revealed a deep division among local officials.
For district prosecutors, it’s a “cultural barrier,” said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer representing the detainees of marijuana, and a local spokesman for the National Marijuana Law Reform Organization.
“They’ve spent so much of their lives chasing people that they still can’t really believe it’s legal,” he said.
As the first countries to build on small amounts of marijuana as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are on the best path to becoming national trial cases for drug legalization.
Prosecutors and state authorities are planning new borders for legalized sales and are also anxiously awaiting directions from the federal government, which is still planning to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Proponents of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Justice Department will be duplicated.
Despite several arrests of medical marijuana vendors and patients using it that attracted attention, the federal government mostly left medical marijuana stores in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states in operation.
While anti-drug agents are not likely to knock out the door to catch a small bag of drugs, they are likely to oppose permitting state-regulated recreational marijuana stores authorized by new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former policy advisor in the field.
Several Colorado cities are not waiting for federal authorities to proceed.
Even before the election day, some local governments approved a moratorium on any new marijuana trades, although it will take another year to open any trade.
Last week, the city of Montrose in the west of the state proposed a six-month ban and is likely to enter into force next week.
"We don't want to find ourselves in a situation where we're licensing someone and then we're going to have a big federal issue," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our people voted against this amendment.
We are looking at what the community voted for, compared to what the state voted for.
There's really a lot of questions here.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was forced to leave Oxford because I am a conservative."
Today’s students are not the only ones who are attacked for their opinions.
I don't remember ever dreaming of studying at the University of Oxford.
Both my father and my elder brother studied at the university, which I thought was the world’s largest headquarters of knowledge, a modern wine-growing Greek symposium motivating the two pillars of civilization, free thinking and tolerance.
And so in the late 1980s, two weeks after I went to Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, packed up my suitcases, and ran into the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and cried.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I gave up because I had objections to loving students in the next room.
Writer A. N. Wilson reluctantly declared that I left because I was forced to drink from isolated pots.
The truth was less comic.
I ran away.
Yes, I escaped because I was the subject of systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my rather bizarre name or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one reason, and in this cradle of supposed enlightenment it was both bigotical and barbaric: my father, deceased Woodrow Wyatt, was a high-ranking adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I to the Conservative Party.
You may be wondering why I'm pulling it out right now.
Just because the latest news suggests that the next generation of students right from mid-century are suffering similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of conservative students at Oxford is so great that last week a group of these students demanded the same protection of equal rights as gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the JCR at Corpus Christi College claim that because of their political views, they are “often actively isolated, exposed to personal attacks, and are shown to be unwelcome.”
They call for a position in the University Committee for Equal Opportunities to ensure that they can freely communicate their views.
Their situation was not helped by the recent BBC Two documentary show called Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right about the student political event, which the conservatives described as being aliens and neo-Nazis.
The show featured graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who was riding a Rolls-Royce, was dressed in a silver suit and had a stick with a silver head.
In other colleges, conservative students say they are treated as "victim lambs" due to the introduction of higher education.
Twenty-year-old Luke Black, vice president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told the Sunday newspaper that “left influence on universities is growing.
“People think we’re like Bullingdon Club without meeting with us at all.”
Nineteen-year-old history student at Corpus Christi Samuel Roberts, who stands behind the movement for greater protection, says such a climate is "unpleasant," while nineteen-year-old OUCA president-elect Stephanie Cherill says that JCR members' approach to the people from the hillside to the right of the village is "unpleasant".
“This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion, as well as to the good living conditions of members,” he says.
During my first few weeks in Oxford, I was a minority of one member.
In September 1986, I was 18 years old and shy in a protective way.
Hatred of the Conservative Party was the most brutal.
A year earlier, the university voted to refuse the award of an honorary degree by former student Margaret Thatcher due to cuts in funding for higher education.
Atmospheric stalinists would also be worried.
During the first few days of the introductory week, when new students get in touch with each other and with the professors, I got to taste the pellets that were supposed to come.
I found out that not only do professors silently approve of the pupils’ pupils’ pupils’ pupils’ pupils’ pupils’ pupils’ pupils’ pupils’ pupils’ pupils’ pupils’ pupils’ pupils’ pupils’ pupils’ pupils’ pupils’ pupils’ pupils’ pupils’ pupils’ pupils’ pupils’ pupils.
The timber-covered audiences included mining strike, privatization, and government resistance to sanctions against apartheid in the South African Republic.
My first lecture was about the translation of the 18th-century French text into English, and I wasn’t ready for what followed.
"Mrs. Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I've had a lot of embarrassment.
Professor Pitt, a little man with a cake-like face, was very yellow.
"Do the Thatchers refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The rest of the students slipped.
There were tears in my eyes.
"I suggest that you take some basic French lessons in your free time, unless you're too busy with social affairs," Professor Pitt said.
I went back to my room, shocked.
I sat alone for dinner at school when I felt a slight clap on my shoulder.
He was a second-year student named James, who introduced himself as a member of OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said politely.
Unfortunately, that's the way it is.
Anyone who is suspicious of conservatism is the target.
It's pretty bad for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be even worse for you.
Most conservative primates pretend to be labourers.
Later in the local pub, I tried to pretend cowardly.
I insisted that I disagree with everything Thatcher said.
This trick turned out to be unsuccessful.
A student of the first year in philosophy, politics and economics who (what an irony) went to Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're infected.
The other students took note of it.
I was twisted, dirty.
"How do conservatives love each other?" one asked.
They're kicking each other, aren't they?
I felt the same way that homosexuals had to feel before the liberal legislature of the 1960s.
Can I ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet people who think the same way only after dark?
Do I have to become a labourer and suppress my natural tendencies?
Three years have evolved before me as a purity of ignoring and isolation.
The only openly conservative professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history who sat at my faculty.
He was hated not only for being conservative, but also for being Margaret Thatcher's foreign policy advisor and one of those writing her speeches.
He was barely there.
He hated this place for its provinciality and minority and for its inclination to a Marxist-Deterministic view of history.
In 1997, he became a professor at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said.
I started walking from Oxford to my parents’ home in London, seeking refuge with my uninterested metropolitan friends and family.
I told my father that I hate Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s, all political opinions were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said patheticly.
They wouldn't do that, not in a city of dreams.
Even my communist friends have always had the perfect ways.
His dirty eyes were smiling.
Try it again.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
It would break my heart if you left.
Tired of frequent trips to London, my emotional resilience deteriorated.
My friend, also a supporter of the Conservative Party, was under pressure and renounced his convictions.
The following week, during the course of teaching, when another professor of history seriously declared that I was “the enemy of the people,” I decided to do the same.
Even though I was in the cold, I confessed that my parents washed my brains and called them "old fools."
The relief was only short-lived.
The nail in the cage of my Oxford career was trapped by my father.
At that time, he wrote two columns each week in Murdoch's newspapers.
My doors were locked.
I crawled inside and after five minutes my persecutors gave up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and took the first train to London.
I've never come back.
You can call me a dying weak man.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be the subject of such intimidation and toxicity in the educational institution.
But what is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, from which not only 14 conservative prime ministers emerged, but which also hides to this day behind the unmerited reputation of a place of equality and freedom of thought.
“Valentine prefers elegance rather than fame.”
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: the master of fashion design", which began this week in London, ABC spoke with Nata Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz and other famous customers of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, the old residence of Isabella I of England, is the only place in the British capital worth hosting the Valentin Garavani exhibition.
The designer confirmed this at the start of the famous retrospective "Valentino: the master of fashion design", which represents more than 130 top fashion models created by his studio in the last 50 years.
"I love this castle," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the end of the story in which "Il Signore" Garavani is the only protagonist that could not be written without his honoured clients.
Valentino has always felt fascinated by the rare and remote world of aristocracy.
The first exhibition hall, which lasts until March 3, includes private correspondence and photographs with signatures of the most prominent nobles, from Princess Salima Aga Chan to Greek Princess Maria-Chantal and Margaret of England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino exhibits these personal memories as the trophies of his social ascension: from a simple carpenter from the town of Voghera in northern Italy to an idol of the international "Bohemian creams".
To love the royal family is nothing wrong.
“They’re at least squeezing cigarettes into a great carpet, as some wonderful pop-music celebrities do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an impressive host and guests enjoy plenty and with elegance.
"We were all very pleased to be invited to his cottage in Gstaad," explains Heini's ex-wife Thyssen and a close friend of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
“Valentino always preferred elegance rather than fame.
And yet he is a star.”
Valeria Mazzova presents Valentina
The designer’s charisma is not forgotten by Argentine model Valeria Mazzová.
“It’s been many years since we went to him for dinner after a tour of the Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
There were 20 of us, and among us were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy younger.
In every detail of his apartment, decoration, food, music, in everything he reflected and was feeling his spirit.
Thanks to him, all the guests could feel important and loved,” recalls the top model, who started working with him during the Paris Fashion Week in 1995.
“He never goes out of fashion because his designs are works of art,” he concludes.
An overview of generosity
The recorded life is not a story of obsessions, but of truly repeated love.
He loves people with good education and better titles and they love him.
One of the Somerset House galleries has been rebuilt into a special 70-metre-long passage that offers a role-change: the visitor turns into a model and walks through the passage to observe the "publicity" of the dreams, which he wears.
In the audience of the mannequins are names such as Sibilla Luxembourg, Gloria from Thurn and Taxi, Mette-Marit Norway, Rosario Bulgaria and Sophie Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and Designer in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is the first love, "you can't forget it."
“I remember it perfectly.
These were trousers, shirts, gillette vest and a jacket from the autumn-winter collection from 1971-1972.
It was a gift he made for me,” says Naty Abascal, one of the designer museums.
"I give him preference over others for his femininity and great love for women because it underscores our beauty," the former Duchess of Feria added.
"I like the colors that he uses, they brighten a lot and give a "spark" face.
The proportions are perfect.”
Even the princess and fashion icon Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget how she dressed up Valentina for the first time.
When she was a teenager and lived in Italy, she wanted to be a teenager and have the opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
It finally arrived at the end of the 90s.
“I bought my first dress from Valentine to celebrate in the castle of my brother, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
They were red dresses that had a skirt with velvets, a velvet jersey and a top without shoulders.
It was a dream that became a reality," says the widow after Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
“Valentino is lax in fashion, his passion is timeless,” explains an Italian aristocrat whose life takes place between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg has stored the designer's festive dress "very carefully... because the dresses are not just dresses, it's also a set of memories they have in them."
The "King" of Fashion
The golden peak of the exhibition at Somerset House are the wedding dresses Marie-Chantal Miller from her wedding to Paul the Greeks in 1995.
To create these silk dresses of ivory color with embroidered pearls, twelve types of different cuts and a drawer of four and a half meters long took four months of work and 25 "holes" (as the designer calls his swing).
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the largest authority of the specialized press, these dresses represent the threshold of the top fashion of the late 20th century, "the return of a client from a high society".
Valentino’s elite “savoir-être” over the years is now his best example.
Garavani as the Cavaliere di Gran Croce (highest honor in Italy), the Cavaliere del Lavoro, the Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and the Order of the Honorary Legion gathers as much as any of the husbands of his client.
"My attention has always been drawn to his selectiveness, calmness, adjusted and perfect appearance," said Princess d'Arenberg.
“The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, my great friend.
He was impeccable, time left no mark on him.”
When the princess says that...
The hardest craft in the world: dust carriers in the area of the Kawah Ijen volcano
For four euros, bearers of Indonesian volcanoes are gambling with their lives and health when they carry 70 kilograms of sulfur down steep rock paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and there are those who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anta Wijayi, one of 400 miners who earn their living by extracting sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
For this reason, it has to float every day to the bottom of the crater, where the greenhouse gases escape from the interior of the Earth, and when in contact with the air passes into a solid state.
After cutting large blocks of sulphur, weighing up to 70 kilograms, he takes them on his shoulder in two bamboo baskets along sharp stone paths.
To the peak of the volcano, which stands 2,386 meters, it is only 250 meters, but the exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to get up at the turtle's pace, because they keep the balance and carefully consider their steps so as not to crash and fall into disrepair.
They know that any beating could cost them a life, as happened to a French tourist who collapsed from the Kawah Ijen rock years ago.
Miners in Kawah Ijen earn five cents for every kilo of sulphur they earn
When they’re up, they’re racing their way around tourists photographing them as if they’re monkeys in a circus, and they’re tired of carrying heavy baskets to the weight that the mining company placed slightly lower, at an altitude of 1850 meters.
PT Candi Ngrimbi has been mining in the volcano since 1960 and has never paid more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilogram of sulfur to its workers.
It is then sold for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, as this growth has its place in everyday life and is used for the production of lighters, fun pyrotechnics, cosmetics, dynamite and even sugar whitening.
“Because it normally weighs 70 pounds, we make about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each trip,” explains Anto, who usually completes three trips a day.
One trip takes three hours and is destroyed in the end, but it can make 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) a day.
Although it seems like a negligible sum for such inhuman effort, it is triple what he would earn on the field.
"The daily salary of the miners is very high here. For example, for the collection of coffee is paid 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and the salary for fourteen days is two million rupees (167 euros), "explains the carrier who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a wall.
There was his salary of 75,000 rupees (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6.2) per day and the work was not so heavy, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a serious reason, which is in Indonesia, to be as persuasive as the sulphur, which I believed, and I was married to another young man.
Anto has asthma, bad breath, still coughing and eyes irritated by toxic gases
At the age of 27, Anto risks his life three times a day in the volcano Kawah Ijen, whose sulphur has already begun to collect his taxes, despite his face being protected by a special mask and glasses.
He has asthma, bad breath, still coughs and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases that escape the volcano.
That’s the price you have to pay to achieve your dream.
“I’m going to work for another two years because I want to open a business or study Spanish or French,” he promises more than a persistent English.
This sympathetic and intelligent young man, reached by fate, could be a tour guide, waiter or receptionist at the hotel, and instead do the work of the carrier.
She shares a dirty wooden cottage with other carriers and wakes up every day at two in the morning because the sulphur at night does not cease to fade and its characteristic yellow color turns into blue and glows dark.
Despite the surrounding darkness, Anto enters the crater and illuminates the road with a small lamp that he has attached to the helmet and bought it for his own money.
Approximately 400 carriers carry on shoulder a crate with sulphur from the bottom of the crater
Although the company has high revenues, the sulphur mining has not mechanized due to cost savings, nor does it provide the carriers working on their own, and with such an effort, no equipment.
In fact, they don’t even get a share of 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) from the photography fee, which together with a ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) is picked by the nature park’s keepers from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is for cattle, not for humans," said Madrusin, a 42-year-old carrier who has been working in Kawah Ijen for three decades, since he left school.
He can lift up to 110 pounds and assures us that he can work as long as possible because he needs money to educate his three sons between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life
Although the sulphur burns the throat and stings in the eyes, when the wind unexpectedly turns and blows the mines in the dense outflows that come from the volcano, the miners are so claiming that none of them complains of the way they suffer from serious illnesses... but it is obvious that they are suffering from pain and pain.
Unainik, who balances his basket on his back, can only weigh 50 kilograms at the age of 53.
Each day he and his colleagues drain 15 tons of sulphur in a volcano, which three trucks then take off on a steep road between the huts to a warehouse in Tamansari, 18 kilometers away.
“I’m not going to retire, I’m going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life,” says Unainik, opening a wide mouth with a few teeth missing.
Of his five sons, he is also the oldest, thirty-year-old, earning by diminishing sulphur.
Time passes, but the constant misery of one of the hardest crafts in the world persists from generation to generation - crafts that perform human mules in Kawah Iljen.
Singapore is looking for a baby to save the economy
Singaporeans deceive that they have no children, career, stress, and cost of living and education.
"Singapore's population needs to grow."
I'm married and I'm a patriot, you're my wife and you're a patriot.
It may seem unbelievable that this slogan is part of an advertisement for menthol candy, but still – or perhaps just for that reason – the video was massively spread to YouTube earlier this year in Singapore.
These sentences are part of a rap, which uses local slogans like "let's put a bucket in the oven" as a mockery of Singapore's birth rate.
Advertising agency BBH, which created the video, hopes that this ad will make them aware of the problem in a funny way.
Artistic director Douglas Hamilton said he wanted to use the influence of music to make people “fulfill their civic duty.”
“It’s just a matter of the internet, so it had to be fun and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in reproducing our population, so we felt it was a topic that we had to touch on.
We knew that the government was trying a lot of things like expanding perfumes with pheromones or organizing dating parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not fully functional.
So we thought why not do the most creative thing possible, like the composition of rap, to solve this problem."
1.2 Children
The one who does not take it too much on light weight is the Singaporean government.
It will spend <0x24>1,300 a year to encourage citizens to have more children.
The government package for marriage and family provides up to <0x24>15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and grants financial grants.
However, all of these measures had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy city-state with advanced technology in southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its representatives and strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore is currently 1.2 children per woman in relation to the distribution of the population.
The last time the birth rate exceeded the value 2, which is considered the rate of recovery, in 1976.
Why don’t Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the Department of Marriage and Family of the National Bureau of Population, said it was due to "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities."
“People have a broader range of options available when it comes to life goals and priorities, it’s not just marriage and family,” he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to an increase in the number of free people and to the postponement of marriage and childbirth, resulting in a reduction in Singapore’s birth rate.
While there have been efforts under immigration policy to drastically increase the influx of immigrants as a measure against the decline in population, this has caused discontent among the local population.
On some Singaporean websites, there is uncovered xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who are being criticized for maintaining low wages and little effort to integrate.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year the Singapore government recorded its worst election result since the beginning of independence.
After the elections, an attempt was made to solve the problem by means of quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the decline in fertility rates has known impacts on national economic growth, tax revenues, health spending and immigration policy, Singapore has also had some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it began to influence the real estate trade.
The Office for Urban Development began regulating the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes" that can be built in certain urban areas.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and have had great success in the sales.
However, there are concerns that these apartments can support the youth lifestyle and discourage developers to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of EL Developers, claims that their “shoe boxes” are sold far faster than larger homes.
“They’re more popular, so they’re selling days to weeks faster than larger-scale homes.
That’s why they’re much better for our cash flow.”
However, it admits that the new standards set clearer rules for developers who were previously limited when they wanted to offer too many small houses in one project.
Too stressed.
Singapore is a city state.
While these new rules could aim to increase the nation’s birth rate, an interview with Singaporeans working in the financial district in the city centre suggests they won’t have a big impact.
“People are still stressed, homes are expensive, as well as education, which is why many people postpone it,” says the young official.
“Let the others have children.
But for me, it’s important to rely on your own money and time,” says another, about 20, a young man.
Men and women mention careers, stress, and cost of living and education as reasons for preventing them from having children.
So no matter how the government tries to force citizens to have children, it is ultimately the Singaporeans who have the last word on the establishment of a family.
What I'm private offline I'm private and online
-Privacy.
According to a dictionary issued by the Royal Spanish Academy, it is something of a personal nature or “an area of private life that everyone has the right to protect himself against any interference.”
What is privacy for a person under the age of 16?
How does this definition apply in your daily life and on social media?
Does he understand the dangers he is exposed to when he publishes things on the Internet that he would certainly not tell anyone in normal communication?
Journalists from elPeriódico reported that five boys and girls between the ages of 10 and 15 who are frequent Internet users.
In four cases, the concept of privacy was regarded as "something entirely personal" at the personal level and as a "username and password" if it were a social network.
“He has the biggest secret I wouldn’t disclose,” says ten-year-old Jorge in an attempt to explain the importance of privacy in places like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he’s had accounts for two years.
“These are very secrets, my mother may know about them, but not the whole world,” she says.
"I'm putting nice pictures on the FB or the way we play.
I'll talk to my friends there, too.
I wouldn’t share a photo that wasn’t mine, or a photo that would make someone laugh,” he says.
This boy realizes that it’s wrong to post obscene photos, naked people photos or crimes photos, or write humiliating or gross comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Among them is a mother who has the name and password of one of the accounts.
“I set up an account on Twitter so that I could express my opinions and write interesting posts.
I don’t know if anyone will answer me, I just give them there,” he adds.
“Social networks are fun, I can talk to relatives who are far away or quickly communicate with friends,” she says.
Without hesitation, he says he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
He wouldn’t even care if someone recommended him to someone he didn’t know.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
This teenager owns accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and at the latter he admits that he does not know 20 people from his list of friends.
“I’m not afraid of that because we have something in common, like music,” she says.
According to this boy, none of them had anything to do with him, nor did they want an address or phone number after him.
“If they insisted on me or demanded it from me, they simply removed it from their account,” he admits.
José signed up for Ask after reading the recommendations on Twitter.
These guys are not strangers to what is now called cyberbullying (cyberbullying).
"A friend of mine has been bullied on social media.
They threatened him and asked for money.
He never knew who it was," he said.
The victim, according to José, did not log out of the account.
"You just activated the private mode."
Then explains a series of steps on how to set up an account securely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would publish photos of familiar people in unpleasant or embarrassing situations.
“Of course I would have done it if someone bothered me or just wanted to.
Even though I know it’s cyberbullying,” he says.
KEY QUESTIONS
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and a graduate in Education and Teaching, believes that in order for children and adolescents to be properly oriented in social networks, they must understand that the main goal of these networks is to inform them.
"The Internet was created as a means of searching for information, but when social networks emerged, the rules of the game changed."
Marrielos Porras notes that academician Marc Prensky, a graduate of pedagogy at Yale University and author of the paper Digital Indigenous and Digital Immigrants, introduced these concepts to explain this phenomenon.
“Digital indigenous peoples are children and young people who were born at the time of this technology.
We are digital immigrants, we have to teach them, and we only learn ourselves,” he says.
He explains that this is a complex topic, "because we ask them to understand what is appropriate to disseminate, publish and say, and vice versa, at an age when they are not yet mature."
Also, to be - as far as the environment is concerned - considerate, at a time when what they want most is to be popular, to have thousands of friends and not to think about the consequences."
According to this specialist, the most effective way to show children and teenagers what privacy is is by asking questions that make them think.
"Telling them not to do something doesn't work," he adds.
Marrielos Porras also highlights some of the options: There are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, so why do you do it on the internet?
Or: Would you like someone to post your photo the way you did to a friend?
You know what other people say about you?
When you mark the people in the celebration photos, did you ask these people for permission?
And one more thing: Do you always need to know what you’re doing?
The next point is to realize that they need to behave in the internet environment as well as outside of it.
These are the same rules.
“A person outside the internet is governed by respect, morality and other principles, and the same should be done on social media,” he says.
Dohled
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, first-degree teacher and educational adviser explains that it is necessary for parents of children to carefully read the rules of social networks.
“If they understand any misconceptions, they have a good basis for talking to their children about the consequences that setting up an online account can have.
For example, when it comes to age or what is allowed to be shared or published,” he says.
The Guardian is of the view that it is crucial to remind children of the traditional rule of "do not talk to strangers".
South America summit ends and the Lima Declaration has not been published
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) held in Peru ended today without the release of a Lima Declaration, which was announced and allegedly signed by seven presidents present.
Efe has repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the sixth meeting of the Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the President’s office, who initially stated that the document will be published after the summit, said in a press release on the website that will be later
They also said the content was published by Peruvian President Ollanta Humala in several brief press releases.
Journalists had limited access to information throughout the summit.
During the hearing, a video from the presidential assembly was broadcast in the press room without sound, with a message "confidential meeting, sound transmission blocked".
A small amount of information available to journalists was provided by the press spokespersons of some governments who were present at the talks, but not the Peruvian speakers.
The only document published during the talks was a list of presidents, which called for the election of hundreds of journalists from different national and international media to request more information.
Later, the Peruvian presidential office sent an email to the media with a "final statement" from the summit, but it was only a statement by President Humala, not an official document that the summit concluded.
Last October, Peru hosted the third summit of South American and Arab countries (America del Sur-Países <0xC3><0x81>rabes, ASPA) and even on this occasion the originally promised Declaration from Lima was not published, although it was press-required.
On the official website of ASPA, it can be found that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities sought to ensure broadcasting for all journalists, but completely prevented the provision of information.
The summit ended, among other things, with Chile and Peru’s joint commitment to adopt a judgment by the Hague Court of Justice, which resolves the dispute over the border between the two countries.
Peruvian President Ollanta Humal and Chilean President Sebastián Piñera met during a regional meeting and confirmed that they will respect the decision of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which will begin on Monday by hearing a defence speech from both sides to discuss the dispute that San Francisco is discussing.
“We will undertake and execute a judgment that will resolve the dispute we are discussing today in this international court,” said President Humal along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has been, is and will be a country that respects international law, the peaceful settlement of disputes, conventions and international courts," Piñera said in a statement.
The two presidents’ confirmation that they would be subject to the International Court of Justice’s decision was released after Colombia adopted the Bogota Pact this week, which expressed submission to the judgments of the International Court of Justice, which ruled in the wake of the court’s appeals.
The summit was held without the participation of the presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rouseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chávez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchner).
Paraguay was excluded from Unasur in 2011 after the resignation of then President Fernand Luga and did not attend the meeting.
Host President Ollant Humal was commissioned to start the morning speeches and conclude the summit in Lima shortly after noon.
The president read a final document informing that 16 agreements were adopted and activities were planned on 31 projects between South American countries, with investments of <0x24>17 billion.
In addition to the agreements, he said UNASUR member states will take "important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, which will expand the residence agreements".
He said actions are being promoted to improve “cooperation in the fight against civil insecurity and international organized crime, to improve access to medicines and cheap internet in all corners of South America, and to joint and effective action against the risks of natural disasters”.
When Europe is in crisis, “economic consolidation (Latin America) should not have a winning essence, but should serve to expand our productivity and show our nations a better future,” Humala added.
"We have decided to prioritize a group of 31 symbolic projects that will improve the transport connections of different places in South America, especially rural and border areas... so that our countries are better connected and create new economic ties," the Peruvian statement said.
He mentioned that five of these projects relate to Peru and the cross-axle of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and two related to better connections with Ecuador, but did not give more details.
The final document also touched on the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to bring it back to the Union of South American nations," he said.
Another issue raised by the summit was the need for Latin America to continue to be a prosperous and peaceful region that is holistic and has good neighbourly relations.
In this regard, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, before attending a regional meeting, said he hoped he would meet with his Nicaraguan counterpart Daniel Ortega on Saturday in Mexico to discuss with respect the judgment of the International Court of Justice (ICC) that is disputed.
"It is possible that I will meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow," Santos said.
"We are discussing all the solutions, none of which are excluded, nor the treaty with Nicaragua that would require negotiations with this country," he said.
"I hope that I will be able to tell President Ortega that we will conduct the negotiations in the most civilized and comprehensive form possible," Santos said.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico to attend the inauguration of President Enrique Peñi Nieta.
During the summit, the EU Defence Ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the area’s defence.
UNASUR members are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay, although the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru is the interim president of this regional bloc.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn integration from Europe
Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa today announced that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case, really has to learn from Europe".
Correa, who attended the sixth presidential summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) in Lima, said on state TV Peru that Europeans "killed themselves for World War II" and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically one country."
In this regard, the project aimed at creating South American citizenship, which was supported by UNASUR member countries.
“The free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country that is already in progress among members of the Andean Community needs to be targeted, but there are still areas of backwardness that want to bring us back to the past,” he said.
The President of Ecuador, among other things, said he agreed with the regrouping of the Organization of American States (OAS) provided that the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states would be reduced and those signatories of the San José Human Rights Pact would be taken into account.
“Those who are at the forefront will never commit to anything, and we South Americans will, on the contrary, sign everything.
It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is funded in Washington by the United States," said Julian Assange, founder of WikiLeaks.
President Correa has confirmed that he does not regret this decision because he has not betrayed his principles and respects his “deep democratic values and human rights.”
He added that at the time, “there was a reasonable suspicion that Assange could be extradited to a third country regardless of the ongoing process.”
In addition, he criticized the Swedish judiciary, which asked him to be interrogated on the Swedish territory for alleged sexual offence, with "supposing that its own Swedish legislation allows hearings by videoconferencing to be conducted in Lond<0xC3><0xBD>'s case".
Correa said there was a risk that Assange's physical and mental health would deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he's at our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he has minor lung problems, but nothing serious," the Ecuadorian head of state said.
"But he threatens his physical and mental condition to worsen because he is locked in a small space without the possibility of moving in the fresh air.
It would affect everyone’s health,” he added.
President Correa noted that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on the basis of a permit that allows him to travel to Ecuador is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and European courts, and stressed that WikiLeaks has been dispatched to the United Kingdom.
“We are not negotiating on human rights, we are not using such a word in this case, but talks are ongoing.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and European courts, as Assange’s lawyer Baltazar Garzón leads a series of proceedings at various European bodies,” he said.
He said that “if the UK is to issue a passport tomorrow, everything will end.”
And if Sweden listens to Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or via Skype, as the legislation there allows without problems and as has been done in other cases, this problem will be put to an end tomorrow."
Correa used this situation to present himself as a defender of freedom of the press, clarifying that he definitely does not tolerate "under-average, bad intentions and lies that undermine freedom of expression".
“The greatest enemies of the free press are not we, the politicians, the corrupt and the depraved, but the bad journalists in the service of profit, pressure and oppression,” he said.
In this regard, he expressed his joy that neither such journalists, "neither the bankers, nor the hegemonic countries, nor the bourgeoisie are in control of Ecuador", and suggested that if he is re-elected, "he will continue to make changes in the right way and in the right direction".
President Correa also supported the decision to further maintain a veto expressed by Paraguay regarding membership in the Union of Unasur at least in its next elections, arguing that the whole "must be solid and intolerant opportunism and pussy enveloped in legitimacy" because of the "democracy of Paraguay".
The Ecuadorian president also said he considers "completely appropriate" his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos' desire to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime borders between the two countries now, at the time of the judgement of the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
The verdict is not currently accepted.
"This is a problem between the South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but the will to walk together must be overcome.
They need to be assessed broadly in order to be overcome and be able to move forward.”
He also expressed hope in the settlement of the maritime border dispute, which is resolved in the same court of Peru and Chile, and expressed the view that "it is appropriate for Latin America to seek out international instances if both countries agree to take a decision, no matter how hard it may be."
Regarding the possibility that he would run for president in the next presidential election in Ecuador to enter the third term, he noted that he perceives this possibility "with great optimism and joy, even if it is sometimes very difficult".
Correa said that if he loses the election in February 2013, he will leave public life.
“I personally have never been very interested in power, but so unfair situations, such as socio-economic poverty in Ecuador, can only be corrected by political power.
“My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed this likely victory, so we have to accept this responsibility,” he said.
“If I win, it would be my last presidential term and then I’d leave politics.
When we lose, the same thing awaits me.
I have already decided," he said.
Correa also mentioned the new health care of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
“I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro, who says that President Chávez went to a planned routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the campaign ended.
This is not a relapse in the health of the president," he said.
The President of Ecuador attended today the sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with calls for greater regional integration in order to maintain development, equality and security.
AIDS victims today are the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old when his test result was confirmed: HIV-positive.
"It was like a flash hitting me," he says in his memories of a moment of truth, which the doctor tried to "relieve a little bit," but apparently without success.
The boy kept it from the family.
He decided to take his illness on his own and began to learn about it, with such dedication that he had already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
It is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV Unit at the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), which came in 1994 after several battles with the disease.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was something unimaginable in the early 1990s, when there were a lot of doubts, few treatment options, and a bigger stigma.
At that time, neither the director of the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) had said goodbye to him, "because he had a cut wound."
Having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now it is possible to survive and live to the fullest with this syndrome.
However, there are many people who do not know about their disease and only disappear when the virus has destroyed the body and strengthened the immune system, and then become victims of accidental infections.
31 years since the outbreak of AIDS in the world, or at least from the first documented cases, "signifies a great success that the life expectancy of a patient who starts treatment in a timely and appropriate way is not exactly the same as that of healthy people," said the reporter, Jaime Gujade Villa.
Infectologist and HIV/AIDS specialist Andrade Villanueva explained that scientists have come to the conclusion that since 2008 AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the duration of survival and full-time life depends on the degree of immunity of 200 CDs, with 500 years of age, and 50 years of patients who are not diagnosed with the disease.
Simply put, it means that a person diagnosed with HIV at the age of 25, according to these findings, can "live without problems up to 75 years in compliance with the treatment," the doctor explained in an interview.
To highlight this progress, it is worth remembering that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although death rates have declined significantly in recent years, and in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died from AIDS has dropped from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (announcement of the United Nations Joint Programme for HIV/AIDS - UNAIDS), it is also true that 60% of the number of people who died from AIDS has been found to have been infected with AIDS.
Only in the state of Jalisco, 255 people died in 2011 and by May this year, 187. However, universal access to antiretroviral drugs has been guaranteed since 2005.
Why are people still dying from the consequences of the disease?
"I don't think the problem is the possibility of access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's how it happens at the hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have not exhausted the supply of medicines. The problem is that patients come at a very advanced stage because they do not know the state of the infection, or in the late stage of the disease."
A convincing statement adds: "Nine out of ten patients come when some associated infections are already present. The only thing that needs to be done to be able to affect the overall mortality is the disease that they are diagnosed earlier." Therefore, they need to be tested on a large scale.
In his proposal, he agrees with specialists and officials from the State Council for AIDS Prevention in the state of Jalisco and directly with patients like Fabrizio, who came to make tests in a private lab just because he did it by his friend, and even by the disease of his friend, he got sick by the disease, and he got sick by the tip of his nose.
“Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die, and they don't want to know anything else.
“If I’m going to die, I’d rather be healed three times a week,” they say, but that’s not my case.
The change was for the better, eating healthy, exercising, taking medication.”
To this day, only his parents know that he was suffering from cancer.
“I live a normal life like everyone else.
I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I lead an active sexual life, but responsibly, I take care of myself and the other person," says Fabrizio, who accepted the challenge to share his experience with the journal MILENIO JALISCO, who has today to share with the STRATCH, the STRATCH of the World Day.
"Let them take tests. If they're at risk, let them know as soon as possible if they're HIV-positive, it's better. And if they've already been diagnosed, let them realize they can live like anyone else if they're responsible."
This message summarizes the slogan of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There is a big gap between health and ordinary citizens’ programs, said Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalajara journalist who is investigating information about the HIV virus.
The biggest gaps are in prevention.
In places dedicated to this task, "the distribution of condoms has really increased, we were given one or two before, today we are given packages and a hundred condoms, which is very good, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms," he said.
Among the most prone to new infections are teenagers.
"What do you want to do?" is a common question full of irony and judgement from social workers, school counselors, pharmacists and health workers who are trying to avoid teenagers, the reporter says.
He proposed to change this ineffective distribution. Let the condoms not only be behind the counters, but those hundred be found in the dispensers in public toilets, in places where young people often go.
“It’s not the support of promiscuity.
It is not even about "paying beer and motel," as Governor Emilio González responded to the question of whether he would agree to distribute condoms in his district.
There is no such thing as sexuality. It is best to make condoms available to those who already have sex," he noted.
Key figures in Jalisco
There were 13,435 cases (12,158 cases of AIDS and 1,317 cases of HIV).
This condition is the fourth place in Mexico in new and detected cases of AIDS and the 13th place in relation to HIV.
92% of the infection is sexually transmitted, 6% by blood, and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that about 50,000 people can live with HIV, because for one recorded case there are four to five people who do not know about the disease.
The decision approved by the United States Court of Appeal, which does not recognise the restructuring of Grupo Vitro’s debt established by the insolvency in Mexico, raises a unprecedented precedent for any national company with branches in the neighbouring country and solvency problem.
Therefore, the restructuring procedures for companies that allow Mexican laws in the country of stripes and stars do not seem to apply despite international agreements.
The approval of Judge Harlin Halm’s June 15 judgment at a North Texas bankruptcy court on June 15 last year leaves the Mexican company in practice unprotected against the possibility of confiscation of their property on the other banks of the El Bravo River.
However, the ruling opens the door to the main Mexican glass producer to the U.S. Supreme Court with an appeal against three irregularities.
At the outset, while the judge of this case claims that the creditors are to be governed by U.S. insolvency law, the Fifth District Court of Appeal, headquartered in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings set for bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico.
Firstly, this would indicate the ignorance of international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of multinational companies.
In essence, a United Nations Model Law for the Unification of International Commercial Law was established for this purpose, which arbitrates the American Law Institute.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the vote of the branches from the internal corporate structure, where the debt of the parent company Vitro to the branches is recognised, the required majority for the approval of the restructuring would not have been achieved.
However, this option is permitted by Mexican law.
The fact is that the case of Vitro was not the first in which this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples such as Agremex and Commercial Mexicana, for whose domestic debts was handled by the Federal Insolvency Institute.
In addition, it is true that even after the branch’s votes were deducted, creditors – who stood against Vitro in court in the United States, i.e. "superfunds" such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited – would not reach a majority.
In voting, they would reach about 45 percent to 37.
The Court of Appeal does not take this into account.
From a different point of view, the court blames Vitro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008 - against the backdrop of a serious economic crisis that has hit the United States.
Meanwhile, the family company González Sady is appealing for a re-evaluation directly at the appellate court so that the assessment is carried out with full participation, i.e. with the participation of five judges, since initially only three voted.
If he fails to do so, he will request a review of the trial by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
The case is serious that the court ignored a document sent by the Mexican government as an amicus curiae, which describes in detail Vitro’s procedure under the Competition Law and which points out that the company made it easier for the Consolidated Front by adhering to the Consolidated 15 by adhering to the Consolidated Agreements.
In addition, it points out that the countries have been subject to the principles of the United Nations Commission for International Trade, that is, the rules designed for international insolvency cases, which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
A shock on both sides: a penalty for Vitro and the state.
Overall Ratings
For several months, the Mexican aviation trade unions’ criminal notice against the former owner of the company Gastón Azcárrago Andradem, who was charged with fraud, was unobserved, and according to the pilots’ unions, the container has already passed.
The court, led by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just filed a lawsuit against the National Banking Commission and the Securities Commission, which he accuses of obstruction in achieving justice.
According to her, the control authority has systematically refused to report to the Attorney General of the Republic on the transaction carried out by this businessman, in which IXE Bank of the F/589 Fidei Commission selected 198 million pesos on behalf of the Mexican Aviation Company.
This appropriation is likely to be earmarked for the purchase of the Professional Hotel Administration (Administradora Profesional de Hoteles).
As is well known, Azcárraga Andrade is the majority shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
The Occupation of Dragon Mart
A group of domestic and foreign ecologists, academics, entrepreneurs and ordinary citizens, who approved the creation of an association, met at the University of the Caribbean this weekend to prevent the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
We are talking, as is well known, about a huge shopping and distribution center with products from a "land with a big wall" aimed at Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, which would include a residential area at the bottom for employees from 150 companies.
In the past, Canacintra (Camara Nacional de la Industria de Transformación) has been able to unite the governors of the southeast zone to fight against a monumental site that would partially destroy the protected area and which represents the origin of all resistance to industry.
The end of the ACTA document
A request from the Senate, which the government did not take into account and which requested an explanation of the conditions and circumstances under which the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Trade Agreement Against Counterfeiting, known as the English abbreviation ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Labyrinth (Mexican Institute of Industrial Labyrinth).
As is well known, this happened despite the fact that the Senate itself ruled out the possibility of considering it as a threat to freedom of expression on social media.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
Basketball world racer Héctor "Hetin" Reyes has been associated with this gym sport for more than 60 years and has travelled around the world thanks to it.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as many memories of the history of local basketball as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes has.
Reyes was fired in this sport for more than 60 years before he was put on a wheelchair by a brainstorm in 2008, whether as a junior category player, national basketball league player BSN, owner and coach of the Basketball team Vaqueros de Bayamón, Basketball championships and Poryamón national football team.
"I've been asking for a lot of roles in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, as I was in the 1990s when I was president of the BSN National League, general manager of the national team, and president of the federation," Reyes recalled in his 50th flight, a visit to the home of the reporters.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not go beyond his claim.
The walls of his house, almost all of which are decorated with photographs and memorable objects from his long career, prove this.
Bayamón in the heart
With the biggest push of all guards, those who reminisce of his performance in Los Vaqueros from the mid-1950s, where he was a player until 1982, when he also celebrated 15 years as a teammate or owner.
"It's been my best years, I enjoyed it the most because I've had the opportunity with the Los Vaqueros since 1967 to participate in eight championships, whether as owner, partner, or coach.
It was a series of successful years, including five championships held in the years from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one championship - in 1981, when Jerome Mincy debuted at BSN.
At that time, the team took over "Cuco" Ortiz, who was an excellent leader," Reyes said.
“I remember Gene Bartow, who was a former coach here and at the time at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, said to me, ‘I have a big two-meter player for you.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Minncy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended Raymond Gausse, who became a member of the team and one of our best shooters.
I remember he said that if Mincy brings Bayamo a championship victory, Gauss will contribute to the next one."
The championship, when the Los Vaqueros played for Gauss, enjoyed it, but only remotely, because in 1988 he was already the president of the basketball federation.
At the time, he wanted to devote himself fully to his duties and enjoy Mincy’s position in the national team.
"I remember the first time we defeated the United States in the 1989 Olympics in Mexico.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we finished quarter-finals, but we were supposed to have the bronze to be the Canadian referee who let us repeat the final draw," Reyes said.
Is the team from the 1990 World Cup the best national team you've ever seen?
He is among the best as well as the one who defeated Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the national team at the 1991 Panamanian Games in Cuba, when we won gold and kicked out the United States team, which was quite similar to the one that kicked us bronze at the World Cup.
The crew had not only Minncy, Gauss, Ramona Rivase, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but there were also young people (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, León's brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be in the 1990s.
The team, which may not have had the perfect composition but managed to win the gold medal and bring great joy, was the team from the 1995 Olympic Qualifier in Neuquén, Argentina.
With competing players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and junior player Rolando Hourruitiner, who replaced players excluded due to the fight at the Pan American Games in Mar de Plata, we won gold despite all predictions.
What was Puerto Rico’s best player?
It was without a doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers from international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has achieved such results at this level as Piculin.
Not to mention his work in the different leagues where he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican coach?
It's very difficult.
We had a very good generation, including Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
I love the work of Leo Arilla.
Which of your successes in the federation do you think is the greatest?
That I was part of the most famous era of the national team from 1988 to 1995 and that at the beginning of the 1990s the BSN National League had up to 17 teams in one season.
What can't you prove?
There were things I wanted to introduce, like the division of youth categories by region.
For example, the Ponce boys would only play in their area and compete with teams from other corners of the island only in the national play-offs.
Now children travel a lot and play too many games, which is not necessary.
I also see benefits in compulsory certificates and courses for coaches, assistants to arbitrators and referees.
It's good to meet you.
What are you doing now?
I listen to music most, watch YouTube videos with music from my time, enjoy grandchildren, and sometimes go to basketball games.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who has always been by my side.
Actor Larry Hagman has died
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth, Texas, was world famous for the lead role of John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series Dallas, in which he embodied a man who acted recklessly and was wary and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the cowardly oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series Dallas became a symbol of hunger in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new Dallas series, died, according to a family official announcement given to the Associated Press production company Dallas Warner Bros. on Friday afternoon for complications related to cancer.
"Larry returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role he liked most," his family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were in Dallas on Thanksgiving.
"Linda Gray, who was his wife's representative in the original and new series, was with Hagman at the time of his death at a Dallas hospital," her agent Jeffrey Lane said in a statement.
He brought joy to all who he knew.
He was creative, generous, fun, kind, kind, and talented, and I will miss him very much.
He was unique and lived his life to the fullest," Linda Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and he himself admitted that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, a tumor was found in his liver and Hagman underwent a transplant.
Years before the Dallas show, Hagman was featured on television as a decent guy in the light comedy I Dream of Jeannie aired by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
Here he plays the character of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive girl (Gina) played by Barbara Eden, and takes her home to live together.
He also starred in two short-lived comedies, The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His performances in the films included critically acclaimed roles: The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colors.
But it was only Hangman’s masterpiece in the form of an incredibly repulsive J.R. that led him to the stellar summit.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other personalities around them was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional slogan "Who Shot Jay?", which was supposed to spark expectations about a piece of emotion when Hangman's character is almost murdered, has caused not only a huge number of speculations from viewers around the world, but also risking millions of dollars in rate offices.
This also helped this piece achieve a record in tracking.
The November 1980 episode, in which the answer was revealed, watched an average of 41 million TV viewers, making Dallas the second-most watched entertainment show in history after the end of Mash's broadcast in 1983, which watched 50 million viewers.
On J.R. was shot by his sister-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby).
Kristin got pregnant with J.R. and he threatened to call her a prostitute if she didn't leave town, but there were others who had reason to attack him.
Hagman plays Ewing, an insatiable craving with a charismatic smile: a wicked businessman and an unfaithful husband who tries to get his wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), who was an alcoholic, locked up in the clinic.
“I know what I want J.R. to have on the gravestone,” Hagman said in 1988.
It should be, "Here lies the honorable citizen J.R. Ewing."
That's the only thing he didn't get.
Victoria Principal, who played in the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as someone who was "great on the canvas and beyond."
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of admirers around the world and in the hearts of all of us who have been fortunate to know and love it.
Ten parts of the new Dallas series were broadcast by TNT a few months ago with great success.
"Five parts of the second row have already been filmed and the sixth has just been shot," the television station said.
Immediately after Hangman's death, there was no statement from Warner or TNT about how the series would continue.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in classical works such as South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when in 1931 she gave birth to Larry, whose father was her husband, lawyer Ben Hagman.
In the early 1950s, Larry experienced luck on theater stages in New York City, and then served in England for aviation from 1952 to 1956.
There he met young Swedish designer Maj Axelson, whom he married.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and for a long time lived in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001, he published the autobiographical book Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
“I didn’t put anything there that I knew could hurt someone or hurt him in some way,” he told the Associated Press.
After a liver transplant, he began to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer in the hospital, where he helped dreadful patients.
"I advise them, I give them courage, I meet them when they go to surgery and then," he said in 1996.
I try to give them comfort in the sense "don't worry, it'll be a little unpleasant for a while, but you'll be healthy."
He was also an activist in the fight against smoking and participated in various campaigns.
Starts a course that explores “the end of the world”
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
When religious professor Stuart Charmé decided to take a course on the end of the world this semester, he knew it was an irresistible attraction: The end of the "long number" of Mayan calendars, which is to come on December 21, caught many people as proof that the end of the world will come.
However, Charmé had no idea what awaits him in the next few months: the catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, the budget failure, which some call "debt Armageddon", and the growing conflict in which Israel is entangled, a place where the Christians are apocalyptic.
"I didn't realize this would be the most apocalyptic semester it's ever been," Charmé told Rutgers University students this week in Camden, New Jersey.
When one discusses what’s happening in the world today, as if we had 30 days left, it’s a really good time.
And remember, bad means good for apocalyptic thinking.
And it’s not the only professor who offers courses on “the end of the world” in this semester, which is theoretically the last in history.
At Temple University, expert assistant Barry Vacker organizes the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
“We’re wondering why these ideas are expanding over time,” he says, and how hypothetical scenarios are offered that govern certain human behavior.
For example, if nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, a war can erupt.
This month, students analyze films with apocalyptic themes and explore how they differ from real-life examples.
“I’ve been trying to inform students about what’s possible, likely, credible, and impossible,” Vacker says.
On the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant in art history and anthropology, gathered together to organize a course entitled The End of the World.
"We don't connect '2012' because we always count on the possibility of rearranging the course if the world doesn't end," Restall said.
Despite the "threatening failure", students must study, create projects and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final test will take place on the eve of the Apocalypse, which gives students no choice but to work “until the evening of the expected end of the world,” Restall said.
Courses have become quite popular.
“He spread out within two hours,” Restall said of his course for high-level students who applied for 35.
Weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, we received an e-mail asking if there was still room.
The students themselves make sure that the course is one of the most interesting.
“It’s fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves,” said 23-year-old Bridgid Robinson, a student of religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers University in Camden.
So apocalyptic, secular or religious thinking is only a matter of comfort or its absence.
Will Wekes, a 25-year-old student in psychology and nursing, said he saw all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of an hour at which it could be taught," he said.
"I'm enjoying it."
But no confessed student, the professor, said he believed in the date of the end of December 21st.
“Our first project discussed Mayan predictions and somehow we’re going to reverse them,” said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old student of the last year at Temple University in West Chester.
"The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar," Restall said.
But he added that in Western culture there is an apocalyptic anxiety that goes back several centuries, with people reacting to changes in their surroundings by predicting the end of the world.
The bloom of these speculations caused the Internet.
"People don't think about it elsewhere," he said.
This is what happens in the vast majority of the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University, who is teaching in the Philippines this year, asked if he knew about any course on "the end of the world" there.
"The Philippines will not participate in the end of the world," he wrote, suggesting an exception to the highest authority.
We have mercy from the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years many days of the last trial were discussed, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately begin to think about the next date" or philosophize that December 21 is the beginning of the seven-year period, at the end of which the war ends.
The date is taken at a light weight by students and professors.
A few of them said they intend to go to the "end of the world" celebrations.
“I’m going to call a couple of friends to laugh together,” said 20-year-old communication student Samir Ford.
