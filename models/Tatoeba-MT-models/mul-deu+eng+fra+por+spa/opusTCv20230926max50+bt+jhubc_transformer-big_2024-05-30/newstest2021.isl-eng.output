Screaming in the World
The Looks Like You Need Iceland marketing campaign seems to have gone well and the screams and calls outside in nature are going to attract people all over the world.
“You own the coal mine, I need Iceland,” said a woman outside the big world in comments to an advertisement from the marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland on YouTube.
Another spectator will keep Iceland in her heart for all eternity, and a young woman says she needs to arrive as soon as the end of Iceland is her favorite residence there.
Unfortunately, she is still in the United States, so she expects to have to wait a few more months.
Another spectator asks if there is a way to get to Iceland, because there are no planes.
It does not follow the story of whether he comes from another time zone.
Egill <0xC3><0x9E>ór<0xC3><0xB0>arsson of the advertising agency Peel, which was made by the advertisers together with the international advertising agency M&C Saatchi, said the receptions were hopeful.
“I’ve come across many Inspired By Iceland campaigns that have been going very well, but this new campaign is already going well.
Basically, this is about creating PR value, it is getting the foreign media to talk about the campaign, and it has gone incredibly well.
In a relatively short period of time, we have been interviewed in about seven hundred media outlets around the world, reaching a total of nearly two billion people.
The value of this survey is valued at 1.8 billion kroner.
It's not funny."
The main market is the U.S. and the campaign has gone very well even though the U.S. is not on its way to the country soon.
According to Egils, well-known markets such as Denmark, the UK and Germany have also been well received, such as Russia, which comes comfortably unexpectedly.
Then there were reactions from foreign regions, such as India, which were not specifically put up with.
“These ads have travelled farther than we can imagine,” says Egill, but more than four million people may have viewed the content on YouTube.
“We couldn’t have wished for a better start.”
<0xC3><0x85>rni S<0xC3><0xA6>berg, the photographer of the Morning Newspaper, took the pictures here at the opening of the exhibition, taking pictures of advertisements entitled “Let It Out” in the middle of the last month.
The courses went wide and wide, such as on the Skolavör<0xC3><0xB0>ur<0xC3><0xB0>ur tracks in Reykjavík, in Reynisfjöru, near Skógarfoss, on the Solheimajökl and in the hills near Hjörleifshaupt<0xC3><0xA5>.
The directors were Samuel Bjarki Pétursson and Gunnar Páll <0xC3><0x93>lafsson at Skoti productions and taker <0xC3><0x93>ttar Gu<0xC3><0xB0>nason.
In the roles in the plays were the Icelandic Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, who is from Cuba and Hungary.
Dozens of Icelanders came to do the advertisements but at the same time and recordings took place in the Southland was another group in the West and the West Fjords.
According to Egils, “Let It Out” is only the first part of the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, but is aimed at a winter retreat in collaboration with M&C Saatchi.
“This is just the first phase of this work for Iceland’s studio,” says Egill, adding that the collaboration with M&C Saatchi has been extremely successful.
“It’s great to work with them.
In such projects, it is very important to have foreign partners with knowledge in the markets that we are talking about.”
Explosives: Rotate the position in the labour market, life expectancy and much more
<0xC3><0x81>smundur Einar Da<0xC3><0xB0>ason, Minister of Social Affairs and Children, will meet in Sprengsand starting at 10 a.m. on the Wave today.
He is also a labour market minister and discusses the position of the labour market as such, the Icelandair issue and more issues.
He also discusses rural affairs and the transfer of work to countries that have gone badly and have been divided for years and decades.
Ragnar <0xC3><0x9E>ór Ingólfsson, chairman of VR, will also attend the event, but he will discuss his views on the investment of life funds and present ideas for the workers’ movement and workers to withdraw from the management of investment funds.
<0xC3><0x8D>var Ingimarsson, the tourism service manager in Austria, and <0xC3><0x81>rnhei<0xC3><0xB0>i Jóhannsdottur, the director of the Nordic Market Office, will be discussed on the situation in tourism services in the countryside.
They will look forward to the autumn and wonder if the success of the summer is a false prediction of what is to come.
You can listen to the show below, but it starts at 10 a.m.
This is what she looks like 25 years later.
Actress Elisa Donovan had a popular career in adolescence of any kind.
She was best known for her role as Amber in the film Clueless 25 years ago.
She also starred in Sabrina: The Teenage Witch with Melissu Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury and Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married with one child.
The little girl has worn it in the past, but she gets to look across the street and express herself about Clueless in love television these days.
She talks beautifully about Brittany Murphy who died unexpectedly in 2009 and says she has been a great person.
“I have to admit that I built the character mostly on girls I met in schools that weren’t good to me.
As I read the script, I knew who this person was," Donovan said of his play in Clueless.
I didn’t want to leave the police station after a night’s sleep.
About fifty cases were brought on the board of the police in the capital area today, and the police diary says that the matter has been diversified.
The day at the police station in Hverfisg<0xC3><0xA5>tu began with the police having to have a detachment of a man who had recently been released from prison after staying there because of a robbery.
The man did not want to go away after he was released and did not obey the orders of the police who told him to leave.
The man won a continuous stay at the police station because of his progress.
Then, this morning, a man was arrested suspected of breaking into a company in Kópavogi.
Police were also required to have two people in Bre<0xC3><0xB0>holt for the notification of a physical injury.
Then it also came to the fact that a woman who sat at a snowman in a shopping mall in Kópavogi could not pay for the bill at the end of the meal and was therefore called to the police.
A car crash was also reported in the city this morning.
The driver of a white Renault freelancer looked at her for a moment and then she took a non-free hand.
The car has not been found.
The Glory of the Lord - The Horrible Glory of the Stars
That teaching has reached an Internet flight to pause the series about the Amusement League, but actor Naya Rivera drowns in California these days and becomes the third protagonist of the series to make life a long way ahead.
The episodes about the Glee are a popular series about singing, dancing, and joy.
The episodes discussed the so-called joys of young people in school, their love and affections.
It was not always taken with the sweetness of being in the party of joy, but through singing and dancing, the characters of the participants seemed to overcome every situation that arose in their lives.
But outside the playground, there have been great hardships over the actors and employees of the actors, so much so that the teachings have awakened to the evil rest on the actors.
Naya Marie Rivera played the role of St. Lopez in the plays, a drummer who did not call all of her grandma.
After the show ran its stage, Rivera went on to have actor Ryan Dorsey and had with him his first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and subsequently divorced.
Dorsey, however, refused to present a loved one and the issue of domestic violence was dropped.
On July 8, it was reported that Rivera was missing after her four-year-old son was found alone on a boat on the Lake Piru, California.
The boy was found sleeping in the rescue vest on board the boat and could report to the police that he and his mother had collapsed and that Rivera had brought him back to the boat but never returned himself there.
There is a huge search for Rivera.
The day after the search began, the police officer in the area reported that the search had been assumed that Rivera had drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was found and was officially detained.
It is said that she has landed in heavy water burdens and has used her last demand to save her son.
An accidental accident was reported as a result of a drought.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith played the role of Finn Hudson in the playoffs, the American footballer with the angels who played a key role in moving the Joy Club to the road and respect.
Without the actors, however, Moneith struggled with a personal demon.
At the age of 13, he had struggled with drugs and found it difficult to escape them.
In 2013, his colleagues found enough to come, caught him in and urged him to seek help.
Moneith then went to treatment and everything seemed to look better.
Just two months after he had completed his treatment, Moneith was found in a hotel room after going out to have fun with friends.
Banamein was a fatal mixture of alcohol and alcohol.
It was not meant to be a will.
Moneith had gone into treatment and his tolerance to science had decreased so much that a dose he had previously well tolerated turned out to be fatal.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
His reaction was heavy on his colleagues, but his opponent, Lea Michele, was determined to continue taking the roles and to dedicate them to the entire memory of Moneith and his character Finns.
Mark Wayne Salling played the role of Noah "Puck" Puckerman in the series, Puck was an American footballer, like Finn, and bore little respect for his associations, or all the while he got the courage to admit that he had fun and danced.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his Los Angeles home on suspicion of child abuse.
During his home search, a huge amount of child abuse was found and the matter was soon asked publicly.
It was clear that Salling had already been there.
He was subsequently charged and prosecuted for his violation.
When he was over, he had four to seven years in prison, as well as having to be on a record of sex offenders and looking for treatment for childbirth.
Before the judge had decided the sentence, Salling, who was then free from insurance, was found left near his home.
Dánarroskos was suicidal.
It wasn’t just the actors who fell from a long time ago.
Jim Fuller was the assistant director of the show.
He fell asleep in 2013, at the age of 41.
She was also known as Nancy Motes.
She was the younger sister of the great star Julia Roberts and had her sister's not a nice story, but she told Roberts about great governance and disrespectful performances.
Motes died in 2014, but she suffered from severe depression.
She left behind a letter to her uncle in which she complained to her mother and sister, among other things, about how she had been treated.
“My mother and my so-called sisters have nothing left of me but the memory that they were the ones who caused my worst depression.”
Lea Michel was the star of the show.
She has recently been asked to apply her members to the polling station and to be with a supervised telescope.
Jesse Luken was a guest star in theaters in 2012.
He was arrested and charged for rape in 2019, which suffered a lot of outrage.
Actress Heather Morris played a major role in the film.
It happened in 2010 that unauthorized computer attacks appeared in images of her and appeared on the Internet.
Players Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner played both in the episodes and had a love affair outside the episodes.
Benoist later reported that Jenner had abused her in the relationship.
You can put flowers on almost everything.
It increases the growth of children when they get to play outside in the garden with their parents to grow flowers and get to watch them grow and grow.
It is also endlessly possible to do with flowers, as Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
Just having a moment with the kids in the garden is something that will never be forgotten.
They will remember the flowers, the fragrance and, of course, the precious time they had with their parents.
Buying a boat after 10th grade
“I don’t think there are many seafarers working at the country’s play schools,” says Axel <0xC3><0x96>rn Gu<0xC3><0xB0>mundsson, who spends the summer on beaches while studying psychology at the University of Iceland during the winter season.
The beaches are a very comfortable summer job when you are studying.
If you fish well you can have good income and I feel great to be able to skip taking lessons.
The techs also fit me well in the winter,” says Axel <0xC3><0x96>rn Gu<0xC3><0xB0>mundsson, a 25-year-old psychiatrist who spends the summer on the beach as the previous summer.
Axel was new to a brewery in Talknafir when a reporter reached out to him late in the evening at the beginning of the week."
“The winter I was in the tenth grade, I took the right of navigation for boats less than twelve meters long and I bought my boat the summer after graduating from elementary school.
I've been on the beach all summer since then.
I bought the boat used by my acquaintance, Hartmanni Jonsson, and I let the boat name him.
Hartmann had become an adult when I bought the boat and stopped being at sea and he was very satisfied when he saw the boat carrying his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took the boat,” says Axel, adding that he had bought the boat for <0x24>3 million.
“I made a deal with Hartmann to pay half a million, one and a half, at the beginning of summer, and the other half at the end of summer when I had finished hunting.
So I had the boat on it at the end of my first summer.”
But how could a boy get one and a half million to pay out on a boat when he had just graduated from primary school?
“I had been proposing and collecting money, I had been working with my dad to sea when I was a boy, I was all summer hunting with him and got my share.
I also put my farm pennies in my boot fund.”
Axel was born in Isafjordi, from where all his mother-in-law is, but he has lived in Kópavogi since he was a boy.
“I can hunt here in the western region because I have a police officer with my grandmother in Isis Province.
I learned in this area here in the west of the rivers with my dad.
I'll move between the distances depending on how I feel, because this fishing area covers all the West Banks.
Although I feel better for the West, I have also provided around the Sn<0xC3><0xA6>fellsnest and beyond.
I have also provided for the sun rather than the sun,’ says Axel, who always touches an elder in the morning and sometimes says talks to the mavana and sings for the sky, at times alone outside the balloon.
“The offshore network is good, so I can call, listen to radio stations and music.
I don’t think it’s important to be alone on a boat.
Of course, I try to avoid getting into trouble, but certainly sometimes something has been in the weather, but never a big danger,” says Axel, who is fortunate that he is never a seafarer.
He says the length of the working day depends on how the hunts go each time.
“On the beach road I’ve never been more than 14 hours on the road at once, but I’ve also been fishing in other systems, for example in the rental quota, but then I’ve been continuously for one and a half days in a bit out on the sea fishing.”
The agreement on the coastal routes says he is so that he can catch 770 kilos a day, which he feels is inhibited.
“Other barriers are that I cannot fish on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and I can only fish for twelve days a month, these four months that the coastal flocks stand on, in May, June, July and August.
In my opinion, seafarers should choose their hunting days according to the weather and no other.
This unnecessary pressure is on men to rest instead of having 48 days throughout the summer and being able to choose according to their head.
So if the area could also go because of me, and the sea space that is well located by the fish should be allowed to enjoy it," says Axel, who draws most of the sea salt from its coastal paths, but also only foxes and unique other species float along.
Axel works during the winter season with a university degree at the Núpi Theatre School in Kopavog.
“I don’t think there are many sailors working at the country’s play schools,” says Axel proudly, adding that he only intended to work temporarily at the play school.
“I’m excited because I feel like this is a great job.
I hope that my psychology degree will benefit me in the future at the acting school,” says Axel, who has also come a long way from learning in business science.
Error in Registration Prevented Homecoming
Error in the registration form that people fill out when it comes to the country happened so that an individual, residing here in the country, was not called back in the sampling.
There is no requirement to register a identification number if the person concerned fills out the form in English, as is the case when it is done in Icelandic.
“This will be reviewed this week,” says a specialist in the field of pediatric surgeon.
Three domestic infections were reported yesterday at the Department of Virology of the Landspital.
One of those who tested positive came to the country on July 15, two days after the rules of the so-called “indigenous people” came into force.
Those who were residing in Iceland were then dispatched on arrival to the country and re-preached in a sampling four to five days later.
It was reported in the press that the person concerned had gone after the old system.
The sample at the borders was negative and he was not recalled in the sketch for the virus.
Kamilla Rut Sigfúsdóttir, a specialist in the field of medical field, said in an interview with the newsroom that this could lead to errors in the electronic journal.
Filling out the registration form in English is not a requirement to insert a tutorial similar to that in the English version.
It was first and foremost intended for foreign tourists.
Therefore, the person concerned did not receive an automatic invitation to attend the sampling.
Kamilla says many have followed the rules of homelessness though they have filled out the registration form in English and in some cases employers have also been alerted to sending people back to the sampling service after it came to the country.
“This is going to be discussed this week how it is possible to facilitate people’s access to this to raise their attention to the process.”
The man is in solitary confinement and six have been put in custody.
They were all taking a sample, but two of them were going to show symptoms.
The case is currently underway with the three infections reported yesterday, but it is largely closed due to two infections reported on Friday.
In both cases, sequence analysis of Icelandic genetic analysis has revealed that there are variants of the coronavirus that have not been found here before.
In the second case, it has been reported that Israel, although it was known that the person who carried the virus to the country had also travelled to other European countries.
Kamilla says it should be for tomorrow where the virus is coming from.
A total of 15 are now in isolation according to the COVID. ice web.
There are 135 in the suburbs.
Four out of five infected unrelated
Five domestic incidents have been reported here in the country in the past few days.
Four of them are completely offline and to form it is not possible to find the origin of the infection that occurred at yesterday’s Rey Cup sporting event.
Confessions are still outstanding.
Originally, the third dozen were individually sent to the subcontinent, but they were reduced to sixteen.
There are a total of 34 applications due to these new infections reported yesterday.
This is the second time in a short period of time that an infection is detected at a sports event and has raised questions about whether or not to hold such an event.
Jóhann K. Jóhannsson, Director of Communications at the Civil Protection Department of the District Police, says that it is easy, as long as people follow the rules and standards.
“We’re constantly striving for all those who live here that it’s necessary to keep up with the individual infections.
We also need to point out to people who are holding events that there are certain rules that need to be followed.
“You can do that,” says John.
He says that it is possible to prevent infections by keeping the individual infections in the air.
In addition, the rules and guidelines are in continuous review.
“What needs to be done, and what the Department of Public Protection and the National Medical Service are constantly showing to people, is to think about these individual infections.
Both at home and in the same way with service providers.
People wash their hands and drink alcohol.
It prevents infection from progressing,” says Johann.
“We need to encourage people to continue on the good road we’ve been on, so that we can keep up with the success we’ve achieved so far.”
40% of victims of COVID-19 were diabetic 2
Devon Brumfield heard on the phone how difficult it was for her father to reach the spirit.
Her father was diabetic, and she encouraged him to seek medical help.
The next day he was released.
The respiratory tract was triggered by sudden respiratory difficulties due to coronavirus infection.
Diabetes was identified on the death certificate as the underlying problem, and Brumfield, who is also diabetic, is afraid of death as soon as possible.
Reuters reporters say the fear of Brumfield is not unreasonable.
According to a new study by the U.S. authorities, nearly 40% of those who were diagnosed with diabetes have been diagnosed with diabetes as the underlying disease.
When the proportion of those who had not reached the age of 65 is considered, the proportion increases by half.
A study by the U.S. Department of Defense (CDC) surveyed more than 10,000 people in 15 states who died of coronavirus in the period from February to May.
Jonathan Wortham, an infectious disease specialist at the CDC, says the findings are striking, not least for those diagnosed with diabetes and their loved ones.
Covered in slow growth, Reuters made a survey and pointed out the responses from the 12 countries that responded to comparable rates.
10 states, including California, Arizona, and Colombia, have not yet been able to identify the underlying diseases.
“Diabetes were in slow growth.
Now COVID-19 has broken out as a powerful age,” said Elbert Huang, director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago.
Diabetes is more common among blacks and people of South American descent, who have also been exacerbated by the coronavirus.
One of the best protections for those with diabetes mellitus 2 is to keep the disease in check with physical fitness, a healthy diet and the assistance of health professionals.
However, the coronavirus pandemic has made it difficult for many to maintain the routine for weeks.
Then the high price of insulin has consumed some to continue to work and thereby stop being exposed to the virus.
According to Reuters, the U.S. authorities may have been aware of the risks that people with diabetes mellitus 2 could be caused by the virus.
When SARS coronavirus outbreaks occurred in 2003, nearly 20% of them had the disease, and in the swine flu age of 2009, this group was three times more likely to have to be admitted to hospital.
When MERS did so in 2012, a study showed that 60% of those who died or were admitted to surgery were diabetic.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, a researcher at Yale University, says that because the impact of the COVID-19 virus could be longer, the epidemic may have removed the hole from a number of previously unknown complications.
“I am afraid that we will see a wave of problems when this is over,” said Andrew Bolton, chairman of the International Diabetes Association.
Doctors have warned that the coronary artery may indirectly lead to an increase in complications associated with diabetes, including kidney disease and kidney failure.
Similarly, new studies aim to allow the corona virus to lead to an increase in diabetes mellitus.
Reuters says scientists are trying to understand the link between the coronavirus and diabetes mellitus 2.
The virus spreads to the heart, lungs and kidneys, organs already present in many diabetic patients.
Then a high proportion of glucose and lipids in diabetic patients can cause the so-called “cellular storm,” as it is called when the immune system reacts too hard and attacks the body.
Damaged intestine cells can also lead to clot formation, which can in turn lead to fatal blood clots.
"It's all a great puzzle," says Dela Cruz.
“It’s all about the inside.”
The news has been corrected.
“We were invited to a champagne wine, so they left the room.”
Their husbands <0xC3><0x81>srún Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollason attended this unusual bonus from the filmmaker Ragnari Kjartanssyni to have sex in front of a camera for a work that the artist was set up in Paris.
“We loved each other so it wasn’t complicated.”
Atli Bollason never forgets when he met his wife and mother, <0xC3><0x81>srunu Magnúsdóttur, for the first time.
“I was very fond of her.
It was just the emission, of course, but it also made me feel really cute.
And still sad,” he said.
It’s hard to remember that, too, when the husband first met him regularly.
“I’ve always heard this story.
“It’s just the weekend,” she said, which also attracted her husband at the first meeting.
“I felt and felt so much excitement around Atla that I liked it.
There’s a lot going on and a lot going on and I liked it.”
Atli says the couple have emphasized in their relationship that they are going their own ways.
“We don’t share the same nodes as our colleagues.
We avoid the routines that we observe around us.”
It is possible that they took the erection from the filmmaker Ragnar Kjartanssyni just joyfully, although it would be slightly unusual to say.
“Kristín Anna, our common friend, is in contact with us and asks if we can come and eat dessert with her, Ragga and Ingibjörg Ragnars, at Snaps.”
Then they invited, met the trio at Snaps and got a dessert and a dessert.
They listened to Ragnar who led them through his designs at a photographic exhibition he thought to set up at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris during the autumn.
“He had a variety of videos called Scenes from Western Culture.
He described it in a simple way.”
Asrún says he has described the work as a banal and decadent part of the everyday life of Westerners.
“He had a sketch of all the nerves he was going to shoot and lastly he told us what he wanted to know if we were interested in taking part in.”
The view that Ragnar asked the couple to participate in was to show young intermediate couples to fall in love in a minimalist room.
“It’s a relationship with the beginning and the end,” Atli says.
The couple didn’t know Ragnar much though they knew about him and he of them “but they knew us and found us fit in this.
They said they didn’t want to advertise people.
Perhaps they thought that they would not get the right people, but people who get the sexual advantage of performing for others.”
They complained to Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it didn’t take long.
“When we leaked out of Snaps, we said, ‘Are we not just into this?
It was just like that.
I trusted Ragnari as the artist and his entire team," said Asrún and Atli.
“It’s about love and love.”
Senan was taken up in a fine apartment on the M<0xC3><0xB8>rarg<0xC3><0xA5>ntan.
There was a very small film crew; the filmmaker, Ragnar and the singer and the couple.
After the ignition, the camera had left all the room to wait outside in a car except for Atli and <0xC3><0x81>rrún.
“We haven’t decided what we should be like.
We got some directions, but we tried to forget the time and place.
To be unaware of what we were doing and for whom.
It wasn’t a game, we just loved each other so it wasn’t complicated,” says <0xC3><0x81>srun.
But was it romantic?
“Yes, it was a bit romantic,” says Atli and Asrun agrees.
“We were invited to the champagne wine before they left the room.
It was a bit like being on vacation in a nice hotel in Paris."
The team was pleased with the performance of the pair in the work that moved them.
“When Tommi looked at it, he was crying, but it was so beautiful,” Atli says.
“It’s about love and closeness and the relationship itself,” says <0xC3><0x81>srún.
The couple’s parents have seen the work and Atli says that his mother heard the voice of his son at the Reykjavik Art Museum and then realized that he was part of the work.
“Then she turns around and goes to play in this,” says Atli.
“My mom and dad saw this in Paris.
We hadn’t told anyone this way, but my dad just sent me a message and said, “It’s nice to see the little family in the Palais de Tokyo.”
Is there any way to deepen the relationship between Atlantis and Alaska?
“We’re still together, so maybe it’s deepening something.
This at least deepened my relationship with the family,” says <0xC3><0x81>srún and laughs.
Asrun himself saw the work in Copenhagen with his colleague.
“It was a little hard for me not to be with you but someone else,” she says, turning to her husband.
“But it was fun to see this because it’s just a delay in a much bigger work and when you see it with the other works, it’s really great.
I was able to get away with this and I was just proud.
And there was a little beating in my stomach,” says <0xC3><0x81>srún, who was unborn by the second child of the couple when the senna was recorded.
“It was just beautiful.”
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke to them Asrun and Atla in Love Stories on Rás 1.
Swansea with victory in the previous exception game
Swansea won 1–0 at Brentford in a dramatic game.
This was the first game of the teams in the exceptions of the game to get into the English division.
The game took place at Swansea, Wales.
The place in the semi-finals was 0-0.
The Swansea nationals scored in the 64th minute, but Andre Ayew broke the bow from the point and made his defensive defensive.
Just two minutes later, Rico Henry, a Brentford player, got the red card.
Brentford played the rest of the game less and in the 82nd minute the Swansea players took advantage of the squad.
Andre Ayew then improved the win by scoring an excellent goal and secured Swansea a 1–0 win.
Swansea will lead 1–0 in the singles, but the second game will take place next Wednesday at home in Brentford.
Ambassador for five years since the year 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the U.S. ambassador to Iceland, is in a press release after CBS reported this morning that he wanted an armed life guard where he feared for his life.
It hasn’t been easy for the President of the United States to appoint ambassadors here in the country.
Since Carol Van Voorst resigned as U.S. Ambassador in April 2009, she has been an ambassador for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst left the position in a special situation, but Kastl<0xC3><0xBD>s reported from 2009 that she should have received the Falkword.
On the way to a farewell meeting with the President of Iceland, she received a phone call from the President’s office about the fact that she would not be honoured with the word.
After her disappearance from Iceland, she taught international relations with Army War College.
It was sixteen months before Van Voorst came into service in September 2010.
It may somehow be traced to the fact that Robert S. Connan had been appointed as ambassador, but he did not.
At the end of the work, Loius Ariega had worked in the foreign ministry for a decade.
He left his job in the fall of 2013 and took office as ambassador to Guatemala.
Then we took another unprecedented period of time.
Robert Barber was approved by the U.S. Parliament in January 2015 and came to work shortly afterwards, but no ambassador had been on the spot for 13 months.
Barber was politically ordered but not a diplomat, but he had worked as a lawyer and short-lived electoral fund for Barack Obama.
He quit his job as Donald Trump took office on January 20, 2017, as usual with a politically ordered ambassador.
The Trump administration was unusual in appointing both ambassadors and high-ranking officials to the Washington administration.
Two years before the U.S. Congress, Jeffrey Ross Gunter invited him to his meeting to ask the ghosts and confirm the end of his term as ambassador to Iceland.
In his testimony in the Senate, he said he had never come to Iceland but often to Western Europe, but his wife, who is left, had been broken by the Dutch mountain.
Gunter is a political leader, formerly a dermatologist in California, and has been a prominent member of the Republican Jewish Coalition.
The casino owner Sheldon Adelson founded the association, while Adelson is a strong supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter came to work in Iceland in May 2019, but then no ambassador had been in the country since early 2017, for two years and four months, which is the longest example in the country.
The reason is both how long the Trump administration has been appointing people in key positions and that over the past year the work of the U.S. Parliament has been declining greatly, including confirming ambassadors in office.
Since 2009, he has been a missionary in Iceland for more than five years.
However, this has not prevented the implementation of the embassy that opened the new headquarters at Engyateig.
Implementations are estimated to have cost about 6.5 billion, but the security walls surrounding the building are overlapping with shot glass in all the windows.
However, it does not appear to have enough to fill the current ambassador’s security envelope because he is said to be afraid of his life and has wanted to get armed lifeguards.
Former <0xC3><0x8D>BV player was accused of racism in Iceland - "It was a mistake to come to Iceland"
Tonny Mawejje, a former IBV player, said he was racist when he was in Iceland and saw to it that he had come to the country.
This is in an interview with Tony, who appears on the Ugandan media Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined Uganda Police FC as a player in the top division of Uganda.
In an interview with the Daily Monitor, Tony talks about a lot, including his time here in the country, but he played with <0xC3><0x8D>BV, Elections and Development in Iceland.
“When I came to Iceland, I didn’t play in the middle as I used to play.
The front of the team was in that position but he also had the confidence number I wanted so I didn’t get anything I wanted,” Tony said while playing on the right side of the game with <0xC3><0x8D>BV.
One of the things that Tony talks about is racism that he has experienced in Iceland.
He says this is a problem that many black players face when they play in Europe.
“This happened to me once, but since I didn’t understand the language, I just denied what was said to me.
The next time I heard about it, I asked my friend what the matter was all about.
He then told me that my opponent had let a racist comment fall on me after I stabbed him.”
In 2014, Tonny moved from Iceland to Norway where he joined Haugesund.
He said he made the mistakes that he saw the most.
Tonny hadn't managed to get to the starting team at Haugesund, but he wanted to play more to get to the national team.
Then he asked to return to Iceland on loan, but he joined the Val team.
“It was a mistake to come back to Iceland on loan.
I think if I had been longer in Norway then I would have had the opportunity that I wanted to have,” Tonny said, but he hoped that if he played well in Norway he would probably go further.
He wants to mean that the loan to Iceland has fulfilled his dreams of becoming a big deal in Europe.
Find a worm in a woman's throat
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3.8-inch long black worm in a woman's neck.
The doctor pulled out the worm with a tooth.
Studies have shown that it is a snippet of animals.
CNN explains this.
The woman had eaten sashimi a few days before, which are thin carnivores.
The woman recovered soon after the worm was removed but snails like this are often in raw meat or fish.
After sushi has become widespread in Western countries, there have been cases where snails have been infested with humans, according to CNN.
Afraid that another wave will start in Europe.
Spain is now on the brink of concern over the second wave of coronavirus in Europe, but the authorities have taken action there to reinvigorate the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.
In Catalonia, all entertainment life has been on ice for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona where infections are increasing.
Other European countries have also taken action because of the increase in infections in Spain, but in the UK everyone has to go to the suburbs on their return from Spain, like in Norway, and the French have been warned about travel to Spain.
It is also expected to be repeated in France and Germany, where governments are trying to find a balance to inhibit the spread of the virus and bring economic life back to normal.
The place in Europe, however, is good compared to elsewhere in the world, but the incidence of infection worldwide is close to 300,000 per day, but it is the most infected in America and South Asia.
Worldwide, 16 million infections have been confirmed, according to the Johns Hopkins University, and the death toll confirmed to be associated with the virus has reached 644,000.
The work of the Mosaic Law can finally be enjoyed to the fullest
In front of the Customs House in Reykjavík is a large and deep hole.
The oven in it is men with orange helmets.
There is also a large tomb.
And a lot of working machines.
The street is closed to traffic.
But the street is and continues to be seen by many, and millions of mosaic-finished artworks —like they have never seen before.
Maybe they've never seen it before.
At least it is not worth it.
Work has so far been somewhat hidden, just in front of it were parking spaces that were always surrounded.
People stood there, locked the car in a hurry, and then jumped off to the city center.
“Living and diverse public spaces” and “engaging city walls” are the key to the redevelopment of the Security Guard that is currently under way.
The aim is to enjoy the area and allow the mosaic art of Dor<0xC3><0xB0>ar Helgadóttur at Tollhüsina to enjoy a better view.
In front of the work there will be a square and where the area is well located by the sun, it is considered well suited as a rest area for pedestrians.
The artwork will be described and now the material will enjoy it better than before on this 142 square metre sheet.
In the area there will also be small “storms”, some sort of water slides, which offer a play and provide the area with certain secrets.
In this way, the reforms are described by Reykjavík City, which is being implemented in conjunction with Veitum.
Light water heater, heater and electric power will be renewed.
Many of them have come to their age, but the schools and cold water schools date from 1925 and have therefore served residents and businesses in the city centre for centuries.
Once the road is reopened, the cars will be able to re-open it.
However, it will be unified and will create a quieter and more accessible space for pedestrians.
In a report about the Customs Office on the website of the Customs Office, it says that the house was in use in 1971, but its architect was Gísli Halldórsson.
Because of the denial of damage through the house, 250 square meters of windowless wall panels were formed outside the street.
The building board and the architect agreed that such tiles would have a bad effect on the overall structure, if no special measures were taken to decorate the appearance of the house.
Members therefore agreed to calculate by allowing permanent artwork to be installed there.
During this time, a lot of words went by Ger<0xC3><0xB0>i Helgadóttur, the artistess, says in the summary.
She had worked extensively on mosaic works in Germany and beyond.
It was decided to first contact her before deciding whether she would be involved in the competition for the work.
Often it had been argued that the work had to reflect the life of the port, and the port had been the livelihood of Reykjavik since it was made.
When she was talking to the artist, she was drawn to the thought of such a work.
It was agreed that she would receive drawings and other assistance before she left the country, where she would work on the proposals abroad.
He had the time that she decided she needed, and when she returned home, she made some suggestions for discussion.
She was promptly asked to work for the job.
In addition, it was sought to make a comprehensive agreement with her and the famous artistic company in Germany, the Oidtmann Brothers, but Ger<0xC3><0xB0>r had worked with them for a long time to set up famous artworks throughout Europe.
Contracts were made and the artwork was won by the installation of the workshop of the brothers, who then saw the installation at the Customs House.
All the work was extremely well solved, both by the half of Ger<0xC3><0xB0>ar Helgadóttir and Oidtmannbrothers, says the summary.
There will be an unprecedented Icelandic weather.
It took about two years to work the work, which was completed and installed in 1972 and 1973.
The art scene died two years after the construction of the Tollhouse was completed, aged just 47.
The transfer of more institutions to the country is underway
<0xC3><0x81>smundur Einar Da<0xC3><0xB0>ason, Minister of Social Affairs, is proposing that more public institutions be relocated to the country in the near future.
This was stated by the Prime Minister in the episode Explosion on the Wave this afternoon.
Recently, it was announced that the Brunamala area of the Housing and Human Resources Agency will be moved north to Sau<0xC3><0xB0>árkrók in the autumn.
Six specialists in the field of fireworks are working with the agency, but none of them are looking to monitor the agency north, and the Landssamband of extinction and disease migrant workers has been transparent about buffer transport.
“I think we need to take a step further in this life.
I’m going to take another step in this area.
Further transportation,” said Asmundur.
He says he is convinced that the vast majority of the nation would like to see a greater distribution of public institutions across the country.
“I think it is necessary to make further political decisions on the transfer of public works to the country, as I was doing with the Housing and Human Resources Agency,” said <0xC3><0x81>smundur, but he also took examples of other land-based organizations that have been transferred to the country, as well as the exchange of funds.
All the main from the second day of the Master's Drama
94. Iceland's championship in freelance sports was held at <0xC3><0x9E>órsvelli in Akureyri today.
Some of the contests were held on the second day of the competition.
It was calculated with an exciting competition in the women’s squad in <0xC3><0x9E>órsvelli, but Vigdís Jónsdóttir from FH put <0xC3><0x8D>slandsmet in the squad in 2014, which stood until Elisabet Rut Rúnarsdóttir from <0xC3><0x8D>R improved in May last year.
Vigdís won the Icelandic Championship back earlier this summer and has been fantasy up late, but she has tripled the Icelandic Championship in the summer.
Elizabeth Ruth has been struggling with injury and has not reached a threshold today.
She had only one golden throw out of five, throwing 25.69 meters, which is far from her best.
Vigdís threw the longest of all today, or 60.08 meters in her last attempt and set the course of the contest.
Her Icelandic size was set earlier in July at 62.69 meters and she was still a bit distant from it.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>rún Karítas Hallgrímsdóttir from <0xC3><0x8D>R had the second best throw of the day, but she improved her best performance with a throw up to 50.18 meters.
In the men's category, FH player Hilmar <0xC3><0x96>rn Jónsson, Iceland's Methafi, won a safe win, but he threw 73.84 metres in his next draw and set the opponent.
His Icelandic size in the article is 75.26 meters.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>ni Valur Gu<0xC3><0xB0>nason, Olympic athlete and Icelandic Methafi, won a ball game in <0xC3><0x9E>órsvelli yesterday but today he competed in a ball game that is his main article.
<0xC3><0x8D>slandsmet Gu<0xC3><0xB0>na Vals is 65.53 metres, but he threw 59.13 metres today and secured his victory.
Valdimar Hjalti Erlendsson was the second-highest pitcher today, but he had one valid pitch that fits in 2nd place, 49.43 metres.
Hafdís Sigur<0xC3><0xB0>ardóttir, Iceland’s long-distance medalist, won the long-distance race with superiors, while Hafdís jumped 6.25 meters long today, which is almost 40 cm from her Icelandic medal.
In the women's 200 metres, it was the fastest runner-up, Gu<0xC3><0xB0>björg Jona Bjarnadóttir, who scored in 24.04 seconds, but her Icelandic goal in the article is 23.45 seconds.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>björg Jóna was a winner at Akureyri, but she won two gold awards yesterday, in a 100-metre race and in a 4 x 100-metre race, and also in a 4 x 400-metre race today.
In the men's category, Kolbeinn Hö<0xC3><0xB0>ur Gunnarsson from FH scored first in the 200-metre run in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds ahead of <0xC3><0x81>rmanni's <0xC3><0x93>liver Mana Samuelsson.
Like Gu<0xC3><0xB0>björg Jóna, Kolbeinn Hö<0xC3><0xB0>ur won gold in the 100 metres yesterday and in the 400 metres race.
Don’t get a fine for 27 million kroner bitcoin upgrade
The U.S. Tax Commission has denied a claim by a tax investigator who demanded a fine on a person for failing to sell his funds due to the sale of the bitcoin e-wallet.
The Committee concludes that the tax investigator had not provided a clear reason for why it was necessary to punish the person.
According to the decision of the Board, the director of tax research considered that the person had misunderstood materially false tax figures for the income years 2016 and 2017.
He would have missed out on his financial resources that would be due to the sale of the Bitcoin e-currency up to 27 million, either willingly or due to huge losses.
Settle the man for his pride.
The man denied it in a letter to the council.
In 2016, he sold an e-money for <0x24>27 million.
Hana would have acquired an engraving in 2009 and 2010, when such an engraving had been both easy and unorthodox with a regular home computer.
He then pointed out that when he sold the e-paper, the tax fee for such a sale would have been substantially unclear and unpredictable.
It would have been hoped that the general public would have taken note of such measures in the field of taxation.
He had not intended to pay a tax on the accumulation and had made a statement of his property on a deposit on a foreign currency account.
He would have asked both the scholars and the state taxpayers how this would have been high but without success.
Then he thought it was necessary to take into account that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he started digging for Bitcoin.
He would therefore have been in a worse position than others to introduce complex rules that the tax authorities would not have drawn a clear view of.
The man therefore rightly considered that his taxes for these two earnings years would be reinstated and the burden would be applied but otherwise no penalty would be imposed.
He then recalled that he lived in Iceland and had paid taxes here in the country since 2012.
He had never intended to escape from his duties in a disrespectful way.
The demand for a sect would come from all sides and would bury him in debt.
Brynj<0xC3><0xB8>lfur: “This man understands what football is”
Breeder Andersen Willumsson has been popular among people’s teeth, but has also aroused excitement over his performance as part of the playtime with Breeder in the Pepsi Max division.
Flashes will be in the fire line tonight when they receive an <0xC3><0x8D>A live broadcast on Stö<0xC3><0xB0> 2 Sport.
Brynj<0xC3><0xB8>lfur then removes the ban because of four reminders during the game and therefore does not come into play with new clippings as in the summer games so far.
He had written "bla, bla, bla" on his back for the game against HK last Thursday, which HK won 1–0.
“I don’t know exactly who he was responding to with the payment, but talking about the character was better than trying in the game.
He didn't hide.
He wants to get the ball every time and if anyone was going to match this game then I thought he would do it or create it," Gu<0xC3><0xB0>mundur Benediktsson told Pepsi Max when he was supposed to play Brynjolfi.
“I have to be here for the people.”
“Sometimes it’s hard to figure out what position he’s in.
He looks a little left-handed when it comes to the game, but he has a very free roll in the team," said Hjörvar Haflidíason.
<0xC3><0x9E>orkell Màni Pétursson says Brynjólf is a real entertainer and is delighted to have such a colorful man in the department: “Nobody shares that this is a character.
This is a fun guy and I love this with my hair, and always be ready to meet and respond in interviews.
There are a lot of people who are interested in him, who tell me that he understands what football is.
“I’m a fun force.
I have to be here for the people and have fun with it.”
People are reading the interviews with Brynjólf, people are paying in and watching what's next on the hair on him.
“This man is just a genius,” Mani said.
Player KR says he wants to leave the club - "I've been in contact with a few teams in B"
Tobias Thomsen, a KR player in the Pepsi Max division, appears to be leaving the team.
According to the Danish media Bold, Tobias is ready to return to Denmark.
Football.net also reported on the issue.
Tobias wants to get to the start of the period in his native country, but for this he must first terminate his contract with the KR, where the Danish division starts before that Icelandic chance.
The company knows I miss Denmark and has shown me a lot of understanding,” Tobias told Bold.
“I’ve been in contact with a few teams in B and will probably change before the Icelandic season ends.
There are not many teams in Denmark that can afford to pay my contract with KR."
He said that he would probably have to take a pay cut in Denmark.
“The populations in Denmark have probably found more to be affected by the economic impact of the virus than in Iceland.”
Bjartmar has recovered a bike for millions - now responds for itself after the survey DV
Over the years, Bjartmar Leosson has been attracting interest unlike most others.
He will squeeze up and save lost and stolen bicycles, electric bicycles and vests.
Bjartmar has earned the name “the bike racer” for the week.
Yesterday, there was such a great stir when one published a story of his contacts with Bjartmar.
DV then referred to them in a discussion on Facebook group Vesturb<0xC3><0xA6>linga where it was revealed that Bjartmar had taken the man in the East and said the response could have been stolen.
There was nothing else that could be read from the original writings of the electrician but that Bjartmar had stolen him.
The text has now been changed on Facebook and the prediction of the original news DV updated accordingly.
Bjartmar says the original news of the matter is not at all illustrative of what actually happened yesterday in the East Coast.
Bjartmar said he had received information from the victim's lamp of electrocution that it was actually his electrocution.
The information was deliberately owned by others, but the information proved to be incorrect, says Bjartmar.
“I looked at the guy and I was familiar with the shooting, and there was information that there was an electrician that had been missing for a very long time and was being searched for.
I certainly dated at first, but when I saw him sitting under the shovel running away, I decided to talk to the man.
The owner was certain of his fault and I decided to have a conversation with the man.
In general, I’m doing very well in this kind of thing, but before I could finish what I had to say, the man had taken away from me.”
Bjartmar says the man on the e-cigarette had undergone an invitation to show him the receipt for the bike and had himself called the police.
"Yeah, great," said Bjartmar, "let's just get this clean."
So the owner of the electron proved the ownership of his electron and started off.
Later, the right owner of the e-mail said of his history on Facebook, as reported in the previous news.
In this bed year that Bjartmar has put a moment on this branch, he says he can count the change he landed on the edge of people on the fingers of another hand.
“I’ve been in peaceful communication with the most difficult people in Reykjavik,” Bjartmar said, pointing out that cyclists have long been attracted to the smallest brothers and sisters of the community, foxes, psychedelic people and other people who are part of the problem.
“The bank is a hard homeowner and somehow needs to finance the next dose, because, unfortunately, theft of such free funds is an easy way to achieve that goal,” says Bjartmar.
“My relationship with these people is actually so good that I’ve come up with a lot of good people with me.
Examples are that people have been treated and treated and then looked at me and helped me with what I’m doing,” he says.
In general, Bjartmars communication with cyclists on courtesy notes.
Some people know about him and what he is doing and are peacefully offered to show him receipts, stellar wheel numbers and so on.
Cycling theft is a major problem that has little been discussed.
In addition, Bjartmar says that the police are more about telling people to talk to him out of stolen bicycles.
Bjartmar is dissatisfied with the previous DV news transfer and does not claim to be a self-employed police officer in a personal search for justice.
Asked whether he has not yet come to the ice with his activity, and whether this is not primarily the role of the police, Bjartmar said of course.
“Of course the law has to do this, but the fact of the matter is that the law is not really doing this.
I have to look up at the cops driving away from a huge pile of stolen wheels.
She's very clear on this matter."
“When the law is not doing anything in this, and this is just in front of your nose, and experience has shown that I can achieve success in this category, then why not?” asks Bjartmar.
He says he has achieved so much success in getting on stolen wheels, that sometimes he visits his “rollers” on the street that they would just have the Bjartmari wheels they had already reached.
The time that Bjartmar has called for help from the police has come for her to be honest not to come.
“It’s just not working with the police, and it’s not teaching me, and it’s not the owners of the bicycles to teach,” Bjartmar said, regretting that the victim’s bicycle theft needs to feel the vacancy of the police in this category.
Bjartmar's success is not shared.
A wide range of stories can be found from people thanking Bjartmari for bringing their property back to them.
Bjartmar himself says that he has long lost the number of bicycles he has returned, but the amounts are obviously running in millions, if not millions.
Weighing in there are heavy electric wheels, electric bicycles and electric batteries, but electric bicycles can cost less than half a million.
Bjartmar works day-to-day at play school and every other weekend he works at a concert.
His bike ride is therefore unpaid for the work he does in his spare time.
Life Trees and Long Shadows
The year 2019 was a big anniversary in the history of life insurance fund in Iceland.
Officials had reportedly been given a bounty from the Danish government on all streets since the 19th century, but in 1919 a life insurance fund of officials was established, which eventually became the life insurance fund of all public servants.
The foundation of the current general wage fund was subsequently laid by all-military contracts on the labour market in 1969, which provided for a work-related life fund with a mandatory and full fundraising from the 1970 fiscal year.
In 1974, laws were introduced on the basis of these agreements, and the life cycle continued to improve thereafter.
The payroll system was not the only radical change that the 20th-century working-class movement induced with its tyranny.
Unemployment insurance had been obtained in a similar way in the historic campaigns in 1955, and the organization also gradually received a glimpse of its demands on sickness rights and health insurance, substantial holiday rights, shortening of working hours, as well as deprivation of residence and pensions.
All of these rights cost a great and rigorous battle, but it turned out to be a far greater and lasting struggle than the proliferation of the islands in the wage community, which lost its equality in the grip of price inflammation that marked the post-war period and up to 1990 as many remember.
The idea of creating a public life insurance fund in 1969 was both long and complex.
While people finally came to the conclusion that the funds would actually be the property of the shareholders, the workers’ movement had to fall under the obligation of their boards to assign the representatives of the employers and the shareholders equally.
In the following years after the establishment of the Funds, the demand for the majority of the workforce in the management of the Funds was often discussed in the payees’ associations, but it never progressed, and therefore we still agree with the abnormal arrangement that the representatives of the Funds are not funded.
Article 36 of Law No. 129/1997 on the mandatory insurance of the right to life and the operation of life insurance funds discusses the investment strategy of the funds.
In the first paragraph, it is stated that “life reserves must have the interests of the shareholders as a guiding light.”
It also states in paragraph 5: “A life insurance fund must set itself a moral criterion in investments.”
In the Shareholders' Association of Life Insurance Fund Merchants, the following provisions, in addition to the aforementioned legal provisions, are included:
The Fund is a member of the United Nations Rules on Responsibility for Investment (UN PRI), along with many of the largest life reserves and professional investors in the Western Ocean and in Europe.
The rules discuss how the emphasis on environmental and social issues as well as good governance of companies can contribute to the improvement of investment gains in securities.
In this way, the interests of the investor and the objectives of the society are combined in a broader context.
LV believes it is important that companies, especially those listed on the stock market, set up a public policy: to maintain good governance in terms of social responsibility and environmental issues.
The Gildi Life Fund, which has the largest funds in the country, has set up a “strategy for responsible investments” and there are provisions of similar interest.
All this is described here as an introduction to the latest Icelandic fashion word, “shadow management”.
Since the word is not used in this case, it is not hoped that it has been defined as a shield, but it seems to me that the following definition is now being “most taken”: Shadow management is when a leader in a corporate society says in the media that he intends to send the money to the public.
If they do not comply with the recommendations, they will be dismissed from the board at first appropriateness.
If the predecessor does not do this in the media and does not talk about resignation, then it is not “shadow management” that, of course, communication between people is always the same in the financial world as elsewhere.
I let the reader think about how he feels “shadowier.”
In particular, two people have tried to form this definition when it is written, on the morning of Saturday, July 25, 2020.
They are Hör<0xC3><0xB0><0xC3><0xB0>ur <0xC3><0x86>gisson journalist on the Newspaper and <0xC3><0x81>sgeir Jónsson banking director.
The reason for the two incidents came after the CEO of Icelandair, Bogi Nils Bogason, had said that he intended to conclude the company's contracts with the air carriers and air service providers (let them go), and Ragnar Thor Ingolfsson, full-fledged manager, chairman of the Company's Association of the Republic of Ireland.
Some time later, Bogi Nils withdrew his decision, and Ragnar <0xC3><0x9E>ór subsequently went the same way as his suggestions, which of course focused on Boga's decision.
Nonetheless, Hör<0xC3><0xB0>ur and <0xC3><0x81>sgeir saw a reason to discuss the matter in the Friday newspaper of the Newspaper with big words about police administration, bribery and the need for rich amendments to the law.
There was a small pond that really had to roll a heavy pond even though the blessed pond had been in reception and also was soon wiped out.
Since the matter is important, let’s think about the substance itself in the end.
I’ve put in front of the issues in the life insurance law that highlight this issue.
These include that the government must take care of the interests of the shareholders and have ethical criteria in investments, and these elements are detailed in the approvals of both the Gildis and the Life Insurance Fund of the merchants as I mentioned.
Life-saving funds, however, should NOT only look at short-term equity prospects in their investments.
Such would be very dangerous policies, and there is no need to look long for examples of such in the past, where large loans of banks and funds have led to immoral adventurers and environmentalists, with sad consequences.
The CEO of Icelandair was clearly on the ice when he was given the idea of wiping out the entire group of employees, thus significantly reducing the well-being that the company has enjoyed in the Icelandic market and weakening its position with regard to investors.
As soon as he saw it, he pulled it back.
Time will reveal whether it is sufficient for the investment of a life insurance fund in the company to be considered as a liability to the shareholders once it is established.

One of the infected didn’t hold a homecoming passport.
One of the three people who were diagnosed with Covid-19 in the country yesterday came to the country from the Baltic States on July 15, about a week and a half ago.
He is an Icelander who does not live here as a standard and therefore did not receive clear instructions to maintain the so-called “homecoming” after his arrival in the country and to go to another exhibition a few days after his arrival.
He got a negative from the skiing at the border.
“But he’s in Icelandic society and he’s actually going to that resort,” says Kamilla Jósefsdóttir, a specialist in the field of prophylaxis at the Landmedic and a local prophylaxis practitioner during his summer vacation, in a conversation with the Newspaper today.
“He used the English registration form and there is no obligation to register the tutorial number and if the tutorial is not registered then you are not automatically invited to the later sample.”
She says that the man was able to use the English registration form because he is actually resident abroad, but because of his relationship with the country that the Icelander would rather have used it in Icelandic.
But he hadn’t noticed this.
“When the tutorial is not registered, you need to check it yourself to come to the second sampling.
Neither he nor his employer seems to have realized that this is the right way,” Kamilla says.
“So it is clear that we need to improve the information on this while we find some way to make an automated preaching system even though Icelanders do not register their tutorials.
Or to do so in a way that is clear who are participants in the Icelandic community in the registration system,” she explains.
At best, however, the person concerned will receive the arrival to the country although he is defined as a participant in the Icelandic community, being Icelandic.
Only six have been sent to the suburbs after he was diagnosed yesterday and these six were all in agreement with him.
They are due to go to a sample, but the two of them are still showing symptoms of Covid-19 infection.
The man was negatively affected by his sampling at the border on July 15.
Kamilla says he may have recently been infected with the virus that she has not yet been able to detect it when the sample was taken at the border.
She does not want to rule out that the man has been infected here in Iceland but does not carry the virus to the country.
“It’s not entirely possible to maintain that this is definitely an imported infection because it’s long since he came to the country that he could have been exposed here like these two who have caused little control in connection with the sporting event.”
She says it’s very unlikely because of why the man gets involved here.
“It’s really very unlikely,” says Kamilla, but noting that it can’t be excluded until Icelandic genetic analysis has been sorted by the virus in humans.
“If we get a virus type that hasn’t been seen here before, it’s almost certain that it’s brought to the country.”
Pepper Prices and Explosions Applied Against Anti-Aggression
There was a controversy between police and protesters in Seattle last night.
The police used pepper spray and unusual hand blasts, but the opponents broke the rods and ignited it.
45 protesters were arrested and 21 police officers were detained.
Police violence and racial discrimination were widespread in the United States last night, but the Seattle protests were in support of protesters in Portland, Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, one of the protesters was shot.
According to the BBC, the attacker has been arrested.
Thousands of people gathered in Seattle in peaceful protests.
A group of people then ignited the building area and broke a crack in the city’s courthouse.
Afterwards, police said the protests were unprecedented and there was a clash between the opposition groups and the police.
In Aurora, Colorado, Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old black man who was murdered by police in August last year, was the least of his opponents.
A car crashed through a group of protesters in the city, but no one crashed.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of black national guards gathered and demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman who was killed by police at her home last March.
The group carried guns and went into the counties to closed street corners where police arrested the group from a group of people who objected to the protests and also carried guns.
There were 75 arrests in Omaha, Nebraska, where protesters commemorate James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man who was killed by a white barefoot in May.
Sunshine: Not the game that defines our season
Ole Gunnar Solskj<0xC3><0xA6>r, manager of Manchester United, does not want to take too much of the importance of the game against Leicester today in the final of the English division.
If United loses the game, and Chelsea does not lose against the Wolves, Solskj<0xC3><0xA6>r and his men finish in 5th place and lose with it from the Champions League seat.
However, they should still hope to join the Master's Division by winning the European Parliament in the coming month.
“We’re not at the end.
"If we get to a point against Leicester, I think people will say we haven't had a bad season now," Solskj<0xC3><0xA6>r said.
"Whatever happens then, this is not the end of our journey because we still have a lot of land to reach the two teams ahead of us," Solskj<0xC3><0xA6>r said.
Obviously, people’s nerves are going to be shattered at 15:00 today, but Solskj<0xC3><0xA6>r tried to make it look like every other game was about.
"If you want to belong to Manchester United, you have to get used to being under pressure in the last game of the season.
It’s nothing new, and that’s what society builds on.
We have created ourselves a great opportunity to end the season well and now it is ours to take advantage of it," Solskj<0xC3><0xA6>r said.
“It’s not the most important game of the season, it’s just the next game.
You can ask anyone in the football, the next game is always the most important.
The results do not define our period, we have already had many moments defining this period.”
“The coming of Bruno Fernandes has changed a lot for us and I think we are in better shape and will be mentally stronger than in the last few years,” Solskj<0xC3><0xA6>r said.
65,000 infections per solar cycle
A total of 65,490 new coronavirus infections were reported in the United States yesterday, according to the John Hopkins University.
A total of 4,178,021 infections have been confirmed by the West Sea since the beginning of the period in the country.
900 died from the virus yesterday, but the last four days, more than 1,000 deaths were due to the virus every day.
A total of 146,460 deaths from the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
According to CNN, the number of deaths due to the virus will be 175,000 on August 15, according to the U.S. Department of Defense.
Afraid of the Second Wave
Governments in Spain are now trying to prevent the spread of COVID-19 from becoming more widespread in the country.
Spanish health authorities have reported more than 920 new cases of COVID-19, both on Thursday and Friday.
There have not been more than one day since the beginning of May, and the complaints come at the same time as the Spaniards are beginning to impose one of the strictest export bans in Europe.
The British authorities are now obliged to return passengers from Spain to their destinations on arrival.
A week ago, Spain was on the British list of safe states.
The situation is worse in Catalonia, in the northeastern part of Spain, as governments have adopted broader restrictions to try to align with growth.
In the capital, Barcelona, the entertainment venues will be closed for the next two weeks and the old houses will be closed at midnight.
The exit ban is now valid for 200,000 people in Segria County in western Catalonia.
It is believed that Britain’s decision will have a negative impact on the Spanish economy, which is strongly upsetting the arrival of foreign tourists and is a bad game after the fall.
Tui, the largest travel agency in the UK, cancelled all scheduled flights to Spain and the Canary Islands today.
Governments around the world are said to be preparing for the second wave of the pandemic, but little interest seems to be in recapturing the vast expeditions that have devastated the economy.
Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, has taken very badly such and similarly to nuclear weapons that he does not want to use.
France’s Prime Minister Jean Castex has said the nation “doesn’t survive, economically or socially,” if it was again arrested for banning the country’s exports.
Many councillors hope that local resources that reach the inhabitants of individual cities, towns or regions will be sufficient to keep the virus back in circulation if it comes to it.
Five New Infections in Iceland - Three Domestic Infections
Three domestic accidents were reported yesterday as well as two additional at the border.
This is how five people with positive Covid-19 infection were diagnosed yesterday in Iceland.
A public health announcement says one infection is linked to the infection reported yesterday at the ReyCUP football tournament.
He was sent into solitary confinement and the sixteen who were in close contact with him in the suburbs.
The infected person was a participant in the social activity of the sports community in Reykjavík and is, according to the announcement, “the only part of the sporting event” in the district.
Others who were sent to the suburbs were connected to the man in another way.
The origin of this infection is the unrest and full-fledged controversy with the controversy team of state police officers.
Recipients of the ReyCUP contest have adhered to the guidelines and rules of the ambulance and public health service that are still in force and have taken appropriate measures.
Though weighed the photos of yesterday’s event attention as it could be seen in a very close concert celebrating the good progress of his team on the field.
Just before 11pm today, the following announcement was posted on their Facebook page.
“ATH: Parents please respect the rules that competitors bring their own daughter to school.
Parents are not allowed to do so.
Thank you for your understanding.”
Another infection was detected yesterday, but it is related to the infection that was reported yesterday.
The report states: “Island’s genetic analysis has sorted the infection and revealed a new type of virus that has not previously been identified here.”
There is also a case of contagion and the person infected in isolation and 12 in the subdivision due to the infection.
The third infection is from a man who came to Iceland 11 days ago, July 15.
He was spotted in the southwest corner of the country.
He is now in isolation and six who were in close contact with him in the suburbs.
Two of them are already beginning to show symptoms of the virus.
In addition, two borders were identified and the results of further investigations, such as the process of planting at the borders, are expected.
Finally, the report states: The Department of Public Safety of the State Police and the Office of the Land Doctor urge people to be cautious and mindful of the individual’s prevention of infections.
The slightest question about the presence of symptoms of the Covid-19 virus is whether the same person is asked to go to a sampling at the next health centre.
Patreksfjör<0xC3><0xB0>ur says the campsite is booked for a shopping weekend - Live other guests
The tent area in Patreksfir<0xC3><0xB0>i is fully booked on the weekend, according to Vesturbyg<0xC3><0xA5>rd's announcement.
Guests are advised to check out other accommodation options.
Names Vesturbygg<0xC3><0xB0> Bildudal, Talknafjörd, Melanes <0xC3><0xBD> Raudásandi, Hotel Flókalund and Hotel Bre<0xC3><0xB0>avík as other options in the location.
There is plenty to be at Patreksfir<0xC3><0xB0> this weekend, because as last year, Skjaldborg, the festival of Icelandic nationals will be held in the city.
It has been held since 2007 and has thus become a strong tradition in the city.
Of the application in the camp to be judged can be expected a good meeting this year, if the weather does not set the bar, but DV said earlier today from the derivative prophecy.
Hopefully the worst of the weather will come, and hope for the future.
The website bb.is first reported, and said that all other accommodations in the town were already booked.
A whole cottage caves down at the best place in the city
Romanian workers live free in Dunhaga 18–20.
While the owners are applying for a building permit for refurbishment, their stock has been growing in the system for three years.
In one of the oldest, greenest and most expensive districts of Reykjavík, there is a sleek three-storey villa.
On the ground floor of the house is about 600 square meters of shopping space.
The back of the house is a two-stage door, each of which stores four slightly weighed apartments.
They are in the range of 93-130 square meters, but most are over 100.
The house has a great history to keep.
It was built in 1959 and has, among other things, a video rental, the Skostofuna, the Milky Way Milky Way Milky Way Milky Way Milky Way Milky Way Milky Way Milky Way Milky Way Milky Way Milky Way.
The house has, as light as it may be, remembered its silly beauty.
The house is now under heavy damage, as can be seen in the accompanying pictures.
The property is D18 ehf.
The owners of D18 ehf. are, according to the company register, among others Magnús Magnússon and Gu<0xC3><0xB0>rún Helga Lárusdóttir.
Magnus went to the Borgunar owner group and was the defender of the Borgunar holding company.
In the group owned by the Borgunar holding company is Sálskip ehf.
Sta<0xC5><0x82>skip ehf. is an investment company of Gu<0xC3><0xB0>runa Helgu Larusdótttur and her children.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>rún also owns thirds of the D18 ehf.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>run and her husband, August Gu<0xC3><0xB0>mundur Sigur<0xC3><0xB0>ssson, once launched the Sta<0xC5><0x82>skip edition.
D18 ehf. bought the house in the summer of 2009 and has so little that nothing has been kept since.
Tell the neighbors that the condition of the house has deteriorated steadily since, but mostly in recent years.
On a Facebook page, residents in the neighborhood say that the house “hasn’t been very lively in the last year.”
There it may be recorded that the owners have over several years soared after changing the house and the lot.
The neighbors say the house hasn’t been well for a long time.
“It’s a long time to do something common with this bluff and it’s sad that this has been pulled out like this.”
He also says that he is stranded in the owners of the house for not having been able to finish this, found some common flow with the neighbors of the house and stopped this "law loss".
“Just do this in consultation with the community around so you can hurry up and finish it.”
The “Legislative Degree” to which the resident refers is the organizational process of the course that has been in place since at least 2017.
The owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 were then allowed to build a floor above the current multi-family house and behind the house, a new elevator and a one-storey building as well as a basement.
The construction permit granted for that implementation was endorsed by the Committee on Environment and Resources and derogated from the Committee because the implementation was not carried out in a separate organisation and the notification of a survey was insufficient.
Reykjavík City then started with a divisional organization work and completed it with an advertisement in the Government News in July last year.
It was also expensive and it was cancelled in March 2020.
At this point, therefore, almost three years had passed from the initial application for a building permit and the owners of the house on the initial site.
During this time, the house had collapsed considerably and the neighbors were getting tired.
When DV asked the neighbors of the house about the situation and the reactions of the neighbors, the responses were in various ways.
Some were aware of the owner’s intentions, others weren’t.
Some people get angry at the city, others don’t.
Others were just angry, but nothing at all.
Still others said the parking lot was unused, but the neighbors have used the unused parking lot Dunhaga 18-20 under their vehicles.
A spokeswoman said, “I’m very tired of the government.
“The fact that we have to go through the process in three stages is unbelievable.
It’s like the city of Reykjavik can’t read.”
Today, the house is empty, abandoned and abandoned.
Reminiscences of the city’s governance phases and the positive plans of the owners and many years of their work currently under way.
When the reporter was in the garden at Dunhaga 18, a galaxy door and russian streets opened to him.
Playstation computers and recent TVs are low within the second rubbish on earth —a victim of Icelandic summer blueberries.
It was opened in the old office of the University of Applied Sciences and there are a number of cats from the county to judge.
It’s clear that someone has wandered around in one corner, but no one is visible.
Stacks of sofas and beds and a number of geology pages, which were probably to be booked, were blown up.
The steps of the apartment house were as open as life in both of them.
The reporter was so fortunate to find out about the other residents.
The Romanians were there cooking potato dishes for dinner and invited the journalist in.
The Romanians work for the Ztrongforce ehf.
They have been there for some time and military DV authorizations that the company has paid nothing for the housing except heat and electricity.
Due to the condition of the house, it is not advisable to collect rent.
From the postage stamps in the back of the house to judge, it is clear that there have been a number of foreign workers living there in recent misses.
The recruitment of employees has not been part of the Covid-19 situation, so the tourist contraction leads to contraction in the construction industry, and these two industries have been able to use the services of employees.
However, the Dunhaga 18 family members seemed to have enough to do and have no work to do in the community until after a long working day in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the poor condition of the house, the apartment that the boys shared seemed to be well maintained.
When a journalist quashed the boys in Romanian, he suddenly became aware of the cold: In the best place in Reykjavik, 1,500 square meters of property are downstairs.
Owners want to change the house for improvement and neighbors want to improve the condition but share about the definition of “badness”.
In the meantime, the planning area of the city sits on the starting line, the victim of endless remedial procedures and coherence in the planning process and the phase of the resolution of the Environmental and Resources Committee.
The house is home to such Romanian workers, perhaps those who are going to improve the situation, when the Icelanders stop raiding.
The article originally appeared in the weekend magazine DV on July 17.
In contrast to overweight in post-coronavirus epidemic
Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson will provide <0xC2><0xA3>10 million for a campaign against overweight, which will include a ban on fast-track advertising, after he became seriously ill, in part because of his weight.
Johnson is expected to launch the campaign, which has been named Better Health, tomorrow, Monday, but with the campaign, doctors will be encouraged to prescribe cycling for his guards in excess weight and will also be attacked in response to the increase in cycling.
Advertising on television will be banned before 9 p.m., according to British media sources.
“COVID-19 has alerted us to the short-term and long-term risks of being overweight, and the Prime Minister is determined that we must use our time to become healthier, more active and eat a healthy diet,” the statement said.
Johnson himself has been dealing with a weight loss issue, but he was put into surgery when he became infected with the coronavirus in the spring, and it is partly due to his weight that he is believed to have fallen so seriously.
It’s better for women to make changes.
She said that the new government will be the largest step that the nation can take towards greater exercise of power, transparency, and in working against corruption and in the interests of the whole.
“We need to change gear a little bit now and who’s better off making such changes than the group of people that should be easier to be in these values.
“It’s women,” Helga said.
“Women in Iceland are renowned for their women’s union.
To stand together and be together to make changes.
So now it’s time for us to make these changes.”
She said she was somewhat upset about the emphasis on Iceland as “the best in the world” in both gender and human rights.
“We’re not ready to see what needs to be done.
Like the Patriots are very aware of their history and view everything that needs to be done.
There are many.
We need to know where we’re coming from and know the story and listen.
Listen to the rows of jazz bands.
We don’t all have the same rules here,” Helga said.
In an interview, she said that women are in many good cases in Iceland, but added that, as elsewhere, the population of Icelanders has a pink male value.
She said that the policy was aimed at forming its own interests, governments and powers that were the powers that held the wrongs in all societies.
“Women are now starting to form this group and come together and are just getting a little upset that Parliament is going to move forward to look beyond this 2012 national elections,” she said.
“It’s these women’s values that we’re thinking about.
In terms of human rights and conservation, cooperation, and that we all really sit at the same table," she said, adding that the aforementioned value would be the basis of the new governance document.
“We are a very rich country of natural disasters and it’s ridiculous that there are people here who live in poverty.
It’s ridiculous, we can change it differently,” said Helga.
“It’s absurd that there’s a natural law that women’s jobs are always less expensive.
It’s absurd that flight attendants and nurses have to endlessly stand in a fight just to get a human paycheck.”

Attempted to rob pedestrians in downtown
A man was arrested in the city centre last night after he threatened a pedestrian and tried to get money from him.
The police also stopped the production of drugs in <0xC3><0x85>rb<0xC3><0xA6>, where two were arrested for the matter.
Then the police stopped the motorcycle driver in Hlid<0xC3><0xBD>n where the driver was at a speed of 146 km with a maximum speed of 60 km/h.
In addition, he had previously been deprived of his driver’s license.
The police in the capital area had enough to turn around overnight and nearly 80 cases were recorded in the police diary from five yesterday to five this morning.
At that time, there was a lot of noise due to coherence.
Last Saturday night, reports of eleven noisy incidents were reported and it was widely reported in the police diary.
Last night, however, 22 incidents were reported on board the police.
Six of them were kept in prison last night.
In <0xC3><0x85>rb<0xC3><0xA6>n, the police were called up last night when parties fired gunshots in the air.
However, they were already avoiding it when police officers were barefooted in the garden.
Nine drivers were arrested for theft and/or drug trafficking.
Four were arrested for fighting in the city centre last night, but one of them was kept in a prison cell.
Two were then transported to an emergency room after they fell on their face, one in the city centre and the other in Westport.
One of them was transported to an accidental department after he stopped jumping on the trampoline in Kópavogi.
In addition, police arrested a driver who crashed a wheelchair in Kjalarnesi yesterday.
According to the police’s journal, the biker’s equipment was in “very bad condition” and was suspended.
You can stay in the house Monet for the shopping weekend
The house, in which Impressionist Claude Monet spent the last forty years of his practice, is now available for rent on the Airbnb website.
The next free night in the house is about the shopping weekend.
The house is small and curved, located in the town of Givenry in Normandy, France.
The famous painter lived in the house from 1883 until his death in 1926.
The house has three bedrooms, two living rooms and three bathrooms.
Monet was first inspired to paint his famous gardens in this house.
If you want to rent a house, you must rent it for at least two nights.
According to the Airbnb site, it’s next week off on Sunday shopping weekend, so it might be ideal for some vacation merchants to hurry to book the painter’s house.
The two nights of the shopping weekend cost only 964 U.S. dollars or just 130,000 Icelandic kroner depending on what comes next.
Dozens in subcontinents and some of them are going to show symptoms of the disease caused by the coronavirus
Five have been diagnosed with domestic coronavirus in the last three days and most of the infected are unrelated.
Dozens have come to the rescue because of this, and some of them are going to show signs of the disease caused by the virus.
Three were diagnosed with domestic coronavirus yesterday and two with a border crossing.
A specialist at the office of a national physician says that an increasing number of domestic infections do not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading more widely in the community.
“There’s been a breakdown from the previous domestic crisis and there’s a virus that hasn’t been seen here before, so we have no special reason to think that it’s been hiding in the community for some time.
This is probably something new to the country, but of course we need to be very careful now,” said Kamilla Sigrí<0xC3><0xB0>ur Jósefsdóttir, a specialist in the field of prophylaxis of the country doctor.
Most of the infected people have been in contact with individuals who came from abroad.
Further sampling takes place in the near future, but some who were in contact with those infected are going to show symptoms of the coronavirus.
“There is no influenza in progress and less about other respiratory infections so we can be quite free to do these tests on individuals who at the time of the influenza had found a reason to do something else first,” Kamilla said.
A simulation is mostly completed, but it is not excluded that more need to go to the subdivision.
Two of the infected people were diagnosed after attending a sporting event.
It has raised questions as to whether it is advisable to hold such an event.
The Director of Public Relationships says it well as long as people follow the standards and rules.
Kamilla says almost exclusively that the infected had been infected in the sporting events.
“If there’s no more isolation from these individuals after they’ve been interfering in these sporting events, then we can maintain that our download protections at the events have worked.
“It’s not clear,” Camilla said.
The work of the public health department is under constant review.
“We need to be ready to intervene with further advice or restrictions if there seems to be a reason,” Kamilla said.
After a week’s bedtime, the datasets will be expanded to a thousand people.
This new position could have an impact on the proposals.

Dinner: Fish will be very often for the choice of my home, otherwise some delicious vegetable dishes.
Dispute between police and protesters in Seattle
Cities in Seattle, Washington state, have declared a state of insurgency in the wake of mass protests in the city center.
Yesterday, police detonated bombs and pipes to attempt to demolish a large area under which the protesters laid down, stretching over several blocks of houses near the city’s parliament.
Police said on Twitter that at least eleven protesters had been arrested and that an investigation into the damage was carried out at a police station in the city yesterday, possibly with some kind of explosion.
City and police officials say the protesters had raided police with rubble, bottles, blasts and other casualties, and one police officer was transported to a hospital where his injuries were inflicted.
The protests in Seattle, however, were peaceful for a long time.
The blast was for them to show off to protesters in Portland, Oregon, but there has been fierce clashes in the city between protesters and heavily armed Swiss state police.
There, like in many cities of the United States, people gather under the label Black Lives Matter, recalls Georges Floyds, who was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis on May 25, protesting systemic racism in the U.S. community and demanding redress.
Not cancelled until after the vote has been paid.
It is not yet clear whether Icelandair’s cancellations, which are due to take effect in the coming months, will be revoked.
The electronic voting payment for the Icelandic Air Freight Company’s contract for Icelandair expires at noon tomorrow.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>laug Líney Jóhannsdóttir, chairman of the company, says with certainty that Icelandair will not take a decision on the cancellations until the outcome of the vote is presented.
“It’s going to be a big deal,” said Lloyd.
“There have been no cancellations, this has to be done so that the machines can be manned.
So, of course, people are tireless after getting to know if it’s going to work after a month’s workout.”
It was signed a week ago, on the night of July 19.
It is expected to be valid until the end of September 2025 and is based on an agreement that air carriers had previously included in voting payments.
On July 17, the Board of Directors and the Board of Trustees of the Icelandic Air Frey Association agreed to offer a full-fledged job with Icelandair, and the members agreed to it in voting.
It never came to her, but this was decided following the decision of Icelandair to stop talks with the Airline, cancel all its airline and look for agreements with another airline.
In this case, the airline should take on temporary security services, such as the airline.
Asked how she thinks the vote will go, Gu<0xC3><0xB0>laug Líney says it’s hard to say about it.
“People are saddened by this Icelandair operation, when all of the airline’s passengers were cancelled and announced that there would be a partnership with another airline.
It is now clear whether it will have an effect,” she said.
At the end of April, 940 airliners worked with Icelandair, but 900 of them, about 95%, were cancelled.
It is a failure of their recruitment rate, for those who have the most employees, it is three months and ends about the July-August period.
In this group, about 90% of Icelandic airlines are in Iceland.
What will happen if the agreement is not approved?
“We want to continue our conversations with our colleagues.
With this agreement, we are meeting the requirements of Icelandair.
If he is denied it is clear that the flight crews have gone too far.”
Vote payments for the lockdown agreement ends and Icelandair announces the deadline for the second quarter tomorrow
The voting fee for the new charter agreement ends at 12 noon tomorrow.
Icelandair’s figures for the second quarter will also be published tomorrow, but the company’s earnings have fallen by 85 percent from the same period last year.
The electronic voting payments for the cancellation agreement between the Icelandic Aviation Society and the Icelandair Association for Business began on Wednesday, 22 July, and ends tomorrow, Monday, 27 July, at 12 p.m.
Those who are eligible to vote for the agreement are Icelandair employees who pay the company fees to the Air Freight Company.
Icelandair and FF<0xC3><0x8D> signed a new deal on the night of Sunday, July 19, but on Friday, Icelandair had negotiated with the airline after air carriers failed the previous deal in voting payments in early July.
Icelandair had cancelled all of the airline’s flights and flights on Friday, but they were withdrawn after a new charter agreement was signed.
According to the new charter agreement, air carriers need to fly five times more per month for the same basis.
The agreement is valid until 2025, but it incorporates the provisions of aviation and air traffic controls on how long a single flight can be carried out.
The deal was introduced to FF<0xC3><0x8D>’s partners at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica hotel last Monday and described several airline incidents that the newsroom spoke about their dissatisfaction with the deal.
However, most agreed that it would be necessary to approve the agreement to keep the FF<0xC3><0x8D> alive.
Icelandair’s figures for the second quarter will be announced tomorrow, but the company’s EBIT, its operating profits for the financial sector and taxes, is negative, according to the results of the emergency budget, of US<0x24>100 million to US<0x24>110 million or about US<0x24>15 billion.
Icelandair sent the shopping mall the last Wednesday, saying the company’s revenues had amounted to about <0x24>60 million in the quarter, or about <0x24>8.3 billion.
Handheld funds and equivalents amounted to about US<0x24>154 million at the end of the quarter, amounting to around SEK 21 billion.
Icelandair is also planning to offer the company's share capital in August.
Icelandair plans to conclude contracts with fifteen loan holders, the government and the Boeing aircraft manufacturer before the end of the month before launching a partial bid.
A new variant rather than a new type of virus
“The new virus only means that this has been an individual who came from abroad.
This is not something that has been going on domestically,” says Már Kristjansson, a surgeon at the National Hospital for Infectious Diseases, who argues that “a new type of virus” has been identified here in the country.
Three domestic incidents were reported yesterday and two at the border.
One detected had participated in the sports community’s social work at the Rey Cup but the origins of the infection’s unrest and contagion are over.
An infection was also detected in an individual who arrived in the country on July 15 and two of those who were in contact with it began showing symptoms of COVID-19.
Yesterday, infections related to infections reported yesterday, and after a series of tests by Icelandic hereditary analysis, “a new type of virus that has not been detected before.”
The symptom is terminated in connection with that infection.
It is not a new virus, but the same virus that has spread all over the world, i.e. the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
It is more appropriate to talk about a new variant of the virus than about a new type of virus.
Asked what it means and whether it could say something about the start of another wave of drought, Már says that as if there were an individual case to be discussed and that could result in nothing more from it.
“However, if there are cases of domestic cases that are not related abroad and are of the same type and this particular variation could be concluded [on the second wave] but it is timeless to so supported,” Már explains.
Good luck in the hot pot
Is the secret to Iceland’s happiness hidden in the hot pots?
The BBC's newspaper editors appear in a fun video that sheds light on the country's swimming pools and hot tubs.
The Icelandic bathing community is unique worldwide and it is confirmed that nowhere in the world is equal to the number of bathing sites per capita.
The natural warmth of the earth is the basis of it, but also the tradition of swimming that is rich here.
Children's bathing was legalized in 1940, but older citizens are still not able to use the hot water for health benefits.
Swimming is described as a permanent part of the country’s public welfare.
In the pot, everyone is the same, regardless of the place and position.
Released from mobile phones, people talk on personal notes about home and space, or enjoy the similar power of water: meditating and loading batteries of souls and bodies.
I’m ready for a hundred days of elections.
One hundred days is up until the Americans go to the polls and elect a president for four years.
Donald Trump is looking for a receptionist, but he is on the verge of reception.
Joe Biden, the Democratic Party’s expected bidder, has a large amount of advance on Trump nationwide, according to polls.
According to a recent poll by the AP news agency, the number of Americans believes the nation is on the wrong path.
Trump’s reaction to the global pandemic of the new coronavirus is also very unfavorable and counts more Americans than before the president had considered bad in economic matters.
In particular, only two out of every ten Americans say that the United States is on the right track.
32 percent say they support Trump’s reaction to the crisis and 48 percent say he has maintained good economic standing.
In March, it was 56 percent and in January, it was 67 percent.
According to the average FiveThirtyEight, Biden’s follow-up is 49.9 percent nationally, while Trump’s follow-up is 41.9 percent.
Trump himself has tried to distract Biden from his performance in the field of politics, pushing under so-called cultural divides and advocating a policy that should turn to law and rule.
Biden’s offer, however, puts a lot of effort into keeping Trump’s attention and considers a great chance of winning if the election is really about how Trump has become in office in the last four years.
Trump’s unpopularity also seems to be coming down on Republican senators and fears Democrats could even reach a majority of the U.S. parliament’s senior senate, which has so far been highly skilled.
Politico said from that day onwards that the follow-up of the class and the bidders was comparable and it is now that the Republican class would sound its greatest threat in a decade.
The outskirts have experienced a particularly bad turnout in the 2016 elections, and it is now expected that this development will continue.
In recent days, Trump has tried to intimidate the outermost population to follow up, among other things by saying that Biden will be president, will destroy the outermost parts of the United States and push racial divides.
Among other things, Trump has downplayed a regulation from the time of Barack Obama in the White House that was intended to increase diversity in outer space.
He then urged the U.S. outsourcing “housekeepers” to read an article about the former New York State Assistant Director, who held that Biden would destroy the outsourcing of the U.S. and undertook Trump.
“The city will destroy your cities and your American dreams.
I’ll keep it, and even do it better,” the president said.
The population of the outlying United States is an ever-growing group of voters.
According to the NPR, they account for about half of all voters in the United States.
Since George W. Bush was reelected in 2004, the bidder who has received the majority of the votes of this group has become the president.
In 2012, Mitt Romney won the majority of the vote but lost to Barack Obama.
Investigations have shown that even though Trump secured the majority in the 2016 outskirts, his follow-up has drastically diminished.
While there is a difference between the polls, Biden has reported about fifteen percent advances on Trump in the previous broadcasts.

Will the Olympics be the light at the end of the street?
After the final decision had been made to postpone the Olympics, an event that only the World Wars have done so, the president of the International Olympic Committee said that the Olympics would be the famous “light at the end of the world” and that the world would be the light at the end of the world.
In addition, Africans have a year to prepare themselves and the Japanese authorities will increase their costs due to the delay.
But everyone ends up in a lot of trouble.
When it was announced that Tokyo, Japan, would be the venue for this year’s Olympics, the joys of the Japanese representatives were unhappy.
They cried and hugged for a turn, finally Tokyo had applied to hold the 2016 games but said it was in the lower half for Rio, Brazil.
This time, Tokyo and Japan were to take a bath in the world’s attention.
The plays are scheduled to take place from July 24 to August 9, but have been postponed for one year, starting on July 23, 2021 and ending on August 8.
If the games are not maintained, if the coronavirus is still too severe a threat, the games will be discontinued.
No one wants to think about it until the end.
The Olympics are not a regular sporting event.
There is nothing to save, the show should always be great and seek to top the last game.
The selection of the city for the Olympics is based on the opinion of the city’s committee.
The larger the presentation, the more likely the cheek is to sound.
Tokyo spent <0x24>150 million trying to hold the 2016 Olympics, or worth roughly <0x24>20 billion.
The second time, when the 2020 Games were submitted, <0x24>75 million, about <0x24>10 billion, was put in the promotion.
In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo would receive the games this year, the Japanese authorities had already secured a total of 30 billion kroner for the project.
But that amount is just a drop in the sea, given the cost of building an Olympic village, a player, and in general strengthening the country’s internals to cope with such contests, prepare it and maintain the games themselves.
Planners in Japan have said that the Tokyo Olympics, which were supposed to be in progress these days but were postponed by about a year due to the coronavirus, would have cost <0x24>12.6 billion.
However, a report from a Japanese national auditor released at the end of last year revealed that the cost was almost double that number.
It is unlikely that the cost of delaying games will be fully assessed, but it has been estimated that it could cost between <0x24>2 billion and <0x24>6 billion in addition to the initial cost.
The total cost of the Japanese Olympics and Japanese taxpayers could therefore range from <0x24>15 to <0x24>30 billion.
There are such high numbers that all tax revenues of the Icelandic state accounted for only about half of the Olympics, compared to the lowest possible cost.
The Olympics are an event of the magnitude that they have enjoyed becoming the focus of economists, who try to figure out and look at the benefits and benefits of the games.
In the most pressing case, it seems that many have come to the conclusion that the effects of the Olympics are side-by-side but so positive for the economy of those who hold them.
The dosage effect is something, for example, a lot of jobs for a very short period of time, but for a longer period of time, cities sit well on top of debt-free and endangered operating costs of low-income human resources.
Rio, Brazil, is on the rise with significant debt due to the 2016 Games and has been in trouble with costing maintenance on all the major sports facilities built for the games.
The figures from the 2012 London Olympics showed that only 10 percent of those who got a job related to the Olympics in the city were unemployed before.
This means that it was not a new job but a little bit.
In general, cities have not been particularly successful in financially holding the Olympics because of the associated costs associated with the human resources built for the games.
The benefit, however, is considered to be the increased traffic of tourists wishing to visit the Olympic castles after the games, which is still very uncertain about the 2021 games.
It is also unclear whether it will be possible to take all the spectators who normally download the games.
The main issue, however, is the honor that the cities are supposed to be elected, but it is difficult to assess for money.
In spite of the enormous cost, it can also be said that the joy that the players move is not of the nature that can be valued.
But while the show is nicely generous and there is no one to save, of course it is not just about money.
There are the athletes who are at the forefront.
For some people, it’s surprisingly easy to postpone the game.
Australian five-trooper and gold medalist in her article on the Olympic page, Chloe Esposito, is, for example, a casualty and would have been far from good in the summer but hopes to be in the form of a competition for the 2021 Games.
She is therefore among the athletes who are quite happy with the delay, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who were planning to quit the game this year, they would have been held at the right time, delaying the game in some cases means that they will quit the race before the games take place.
Just don’t trust your body to go through years in addition to rigorous exercises.
Few athletes were equally enthusiastic in the hearts of the spectators of the 2016 Rio Olympics and the film star Simone Biles.
She came home with four gold rings on her neck and one bronze.
Biles has attended several interviews in his hometown of the United States recently to discuss the Olympics.
She plans for the 2021 games, but she is not sure if she will be able to still be in the top of the games next year, she will eventually be 24 years old.
Although it is generally not considered to be high age, it is in higher order for the female in the leading order.
"It's a sensitive issue," Biles said, laughing at another interview posted on the Olympic Committee's Instagram page, asking if she's going to achieve the same length at the 2021 Games, which she did in Rio 2016.
“I honestly don’t know if I’ll still be in the top in a full year in addition to exercises,” Biles says.
She has previously mentioned that her body does not tolerate the stress that comes with muscle training much longer.
However, she is still fighting for the 2021 Olympics.
Biles acknowledges that it has been an uncomfortable feeling to have to stop exercising abruptly when the World War II was at its highest and the playground was closed.
There were no exceptions for Biles rather than others while all sports activities were closed for seven weeks.
All of her Olympics couldn’t buy any access over the others, she needed to find a variety of ways to stay in shape like others.
The basic shape of the eyes is certainly better than most people.
“We have a tough schedule right now.
It was difficult to start practicing again after the opening of the playground.
We started slowly, but we’re back in full swing and I’ll increase with the exercises equally and closely depending on how I feel about the year.
Of course, we do not know exactly how these games will be or whether they will be held, but we still practice considering that they will be, we can’t do anything else.
I’ve put too much on myself to quit the sport now,” Biles says.
With it like many other blinded efi or perhaps even more aware that that position may come up that the games will not be held at all in 2021 either.
Predicting it is hopeless.
No one can know what the status of the global coronavirus pandemic will be in July 2021 and nothing else to do but prepare for the Olympics given that they will be held annually.
Maybe the Olympics will be the light at the end of the Covid street.
Marriage is delayed due to an accident
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding due to the coronavirus.
She was due to marry former Bachelorette competitor Wells Adams this summer.
“I think there are other important things to think about akurat right now,” the actor told People.
“We definitely want to get married sometime and then have the dream wedding and have all the attendees who are dear to us.
But we decided to hit it on time and focus on what is important right now and it is helping to share information about the importance of being polite and keeping yourself at home.
I look more at the world of marriage than the world of marriage these days.
There’s a lot going on and we need to focus our attention on what’s going on in the world.”
