The social card of the resident of the Ivanovo region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
The amendments provide for the maintenance of the preference for travel in public passenger transport.
Since September 24, the order of organization of the preferential travel of citizens with the use of the social card of the resident of the Ivanovo region has changed.
According to the press service of the Government of Russia in the Ivanovo region, the changes provide for the preservation of the preference for travel in public passenger transport and bring the scheme of recalculation on the social card in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Law No. 161 of the Federal System of Payment "FZO".
At the same time, the social card of the resident of the Ivanovo region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
Accordingly, the terms of its application change.
Thus, the limit of replenishment is now established not in travel, as before, but in the amount of money, with the preservation of winter and summer periods - in the winter not more than 400 rubles, in the summer period - not more than 800 rubles for the current month.
Now social card holders on the receipts issued in the transport will need to track not the number of remaining trips, but the remainder of the cash.
The cost of a favourable trip for citizens will be 1/2 of the fare valid for the carrier.
The remaining half of the cost of the trip is reimbursed by the regional budget.
The schedule for replenishing the social card with cash remains the same - from the 24th of the previous month to the 23rd of the current month.
The new order of travel on the social card will have a number of advantages.
Thus, there is an opportunity to keep a detailed account of the spending of the money on the social card with precision to the copecks.
In addition, there is the possibility of returning registered, but unused cash.
We will also add that the scheme of inter-accounts with carriers becomes transparent, as now half of the cost of the trip is paid by the citizen, and the same amount is refunded to the carrier.
No commission will be charged when depositing funds on the card.
In turn, Vasily Silkin, deputy head of the Department of Roads and Transport of Ivanovo region, reported that in 2014 more than 33 million trips were made in the region using a social map, in 2015 - almost 25 million trips.
In the regional budget, more than 470 million rubles are provided for the provision of a favourable travel of citizens using a social card.
As of September 1, the amount of compensation for these purposes amounted to more than 312 million rubles.
During a 911 call, a teacher confesses to murdering a friend.
During the 911 call, almost without a voice, Shannon Lamb, a professor at Shannon Lamb University, told the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that he needed staff to come home.
Lamb stressed that there is a "dog" in the house that is alive, but probably upset, and said the contacts of the family members of the deceased can be found on her phone.
Inside the house, police found Amy Prentiss's body and a note, carefully handwritten on a white sheet of linen paper: "I'm sorry, I'd like to get everything back, I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me," the letter reads.
There was no indication that Lamb, who took two online courses at the State University of Delta in Cleveland, Mississippi, had managed to drive 300 miles to a university campus, where, according to the police, he had shot down a respected professor.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Baford reported that the university staff learned about the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He reported that Lamb made that real call to 911 shortly after that.
By the end of the day, the victims will have one more: Lamb committed suicide as soon as the police surround him.
The next day, after shooting at a school forced students and teachers to hide behind closed doors, officials of the authorities were still trying to put into one picture the motives that sparked Lamb.
The information shared by investigators from both sides of the state, as well as students and staff who knew him, helped to draw a portrait of a talented but perhaps worried teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his classes.
Police in Gothenburg, where Prentiss died, said they were not charged with violence or criminal offences.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in a book he wrote, in which he expressed his gratitude to the “beautiful people” he had intertwined with in his teaching life.
Both of them taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History, which has 17 faculty members, and many students attended lectures of the one and the other.
At the same time, there were some prerequisites for problems.
One student who was well-reviewed about Lamb, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed anxious and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Sykes, reported that Lamb told him at the end of the 2014-15 school year about how he was struggling with stress.
Earlier, Lamb asked the State University of Delta to grant him a sick leave, saying he had some health problems.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes to the university’s recruitment rules meant that a doctor’s degree, on which Lamb worked so hard, would not guarantee him the automatic reception of the position of a teacher.
University President William Laforge said he knew nothing about the Lamb and Schmidt conflict, but “obviously Mr. Lamb had something on his mind.”
These are questions that Lamb will no longer be able to answer.
The police attacked Lamb's footprint after he fled the campus as he was heading back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb was shot from a 38-caliber reloading gun in the backyard of the house, one mile south of his parents’ home in the suburb of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County coroner Metal Johnson said.
His car with a working engine was still standing on the access road.
It wasn’t immediately clear why Lamb came to this house, though, according to Johnson, she believed he knew the people who lived in it.
Lamb grew up in those areas.
Lamb began working at the university, which has 3,500 students in a city with a population of about 12,000, in 2009 and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received a doctorate in pedagogical sciences in the spring of the same year.
One of Lamb’s longtime friends described him as a smart, charismatic and cheerful man.
Carla Harriston said she was 15 and Lambo was 20 when they met through common friends.
She and her friends studied in high school, and he was a cool old guy who for several years tried to teach her to play guitar.
In those years, he enjoyed success with women.
All the girls danced when he was around,” says Harriston, now 40, who lives in Jackson, the suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss seem to have been dating for some time.
During the 911 call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but the record of their marriage is missing.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in Gothenburg in a brick house, the reverse of which leads to the canal.
According to the police, the dog is fine.
Prentiss's former husband, Sean O'Stin, said they were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends, and that they had a daughter who is now 19 years old.
"She's totally depressed," O'Ston told me about her daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Ston said he hadn't met Lamb, but heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at the same summer festival three years ago.
Then they played together from time to time in concerts.
O'Ston said his daughter writes music and sings.
Prentiss was a nurse and worked online for various companies.
Mike Schaffer, a bartender and co-host of entertainment programs at a glazed lighted bar in the suburb of Gothenburg, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the evening of September 5, when Lamb finished playing guitar and lipstick.
There was nothing suspicious.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were having fun and chasing each other.
I mean, they were both very clever.
The deceased teacher, Schmidt, led seminars for first class students and specialised in the history of Native Americans and Colonial America, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher at the same school.
He was married and had three young children.
He studied at Kansas State University in Emporia and was president of the Student Brotherhood and Student Self-Government.
On the campus of the State University of Delta in Cleveland on Tuesday evening, about 900 people, including university faculty, staff, students and community members, participated in the memorial ceremony to light candles.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt were also present at the ceremony, during which the university choir sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
“We are trying to get our students back,” Laforge said.
The crisis has passed.
Today is the day of recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The report helped prepare the authors of the Associated Press Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The material was edited in connection with a police statement that Lamba's call came into service after Schmidt's murder, as well as in connection with the fact that although Lamb and spoke of Prentiss as his wife when he called 911, information about their marriage was not subverted.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for the holiday season
Toys R Us says it will not hire as many employees for the holiday season as it did last year, while the retailer of toys and children’s goods assures that it will provide staff and temporary staff with the opportunity to work more hours.
The company says it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in stores and wholesale bases across the country, less than the 45,000 that were hired for the holiday season of 2014.
Most of the jobs will be part-time.
The company said it will start interviewing the applicants this month and will increase the number of staff from October to December.
Even before the holidays, the shopping season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary employees to have enough state in stores and for the sale, shipment and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about "visiting" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a grand event for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons as well.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the arrival of members of the royal family, I noticed that the place next to me was free, and I was sitting here - Princess Diana will be sitting next to me," he said in a trailer to the soon-to-be-released film documentary.
The film begins, and here comes to mind that I am literally at a distance of my hand and in a fake claw from dating the Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time" - a documentary about the film "Back in the Future" - includes interviews with Fox, Leah Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemekis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The film "Back to the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
"For me," says Spielberg, "it is undoubtedly the greatest film about time travel that has ever been filmed."
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in some cinemas in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in response to Russia’s military support for Syria that there is “no military solution” for almost five years of conflict, and the increase in arms will only exacerbate violence and suffering for millions of people.
The UN chief once again called on all parties, including the split UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Mr. Gi Moon said at a press conference on Wednesday that he was planning a meeting with the foreign ministers of the five permanent members of the Council - the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France during the ministerial session of the General Assembly this month for discussion.
He regretted that the disagreement in the council, as well as among Syrians and local authorities, had made the situation "insoluble".
Mr. Gi Moon called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they demonstrated when addressing the issue of the Iran nuclear programme and when considering the Syrian crisis.
8 results of the poll that show that Donald Trump is not a joke
Some of them tried to put a provocator’s badge on him.
Others turned away from him, taking it as a joke.
Some of them are calling for a scandal.
But no matter how some Republicans try to vacillate Donald Trump’s high status in the polls, they have not succeeded (so far).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have demonstrated Donald Trump’s advantage in two-digit numbers, and some are starting to seriously ask what this means for a real estate magnate in terms of odds of getting a nomination.
This is just the beginning of the electoral cycle.
None of this means that Trump has a chance to run for the Republican Party.
Experts point out that during this time, in 2011, Rick Perry surrendered his lucratively gaining popularity to Hermann Kane, none of whom had won a single state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would be battling in the general election.
But external groups such as the “Supercommittee of Political Activity” of Jeb Bush and the economic conservative “Club of Growth” recognize the impending power of Trump and are starting to get their dollars to back him up.
Here are some survey figures that say that real estate magnate is not just an intermediate phase:
Trump’s sympathy ratings were 180 degrees higher.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey at the University of Monmouth showed that only two out of ten Republicans had a positive attitude towards this real estate magnate.
By mid-July it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Six out of ten Republicans now have a positive attitude towards Donald Trump.
Approximately three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
And all of these figures are at the top in the initial stages.
A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week revealed that 60 percent of Republicans there are reluctant to refer to Trump.
Two-thirds of those who voted for the GOP would have appointed Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they were either “enthusiastic” or “satisfied” if Trump became a candidate.
Only two out of 10 say they would be “distraught” if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be “excited” against 40 percent of those who say the same thing about Trump).
The next level of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, who has only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republicans say they will be “unhappy” or “dissatisfied” if a favored Jeb Bush establishment becomes a candidate.
Most Republicans don’t think Trump’s temperament is a problem.
While Trump is massively criticized for his boasts and insults, 52 percent of Republican-led voters across the country think the magnates have the right temperament to be president, according to an ABC News/Washington post poll conducted on Monday.
The same figure is at the country’s first closed assembly in Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the same person who could be the commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 percent think he’s not the person that can be effective in the post, and nearly six out of 10 independent voters say his temperament isn’t suitable for the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republicans are accustomed to this idea.
When they wear their hats of connoisseurs, Republicans think that Trump is serious.
Asked who was the most likely winner in the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump was a favorite, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
This is no longer the case when four out of 10 put on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: The GOP voters didn’t have the right magic crystal before.
At the same time, four out of 10 Republicans elected Rick Perry as the most likely candidate in the last cycle, while only 28 percent supported possible candidate Mitt Romney.
However, this shows that many GOP voters find Trump’s campaign convincing.
Even if the Republicans were united around another candidate, Trump is still ahead of everyone else.
Some scholars point out that such dissemination is likely to benefit Trump, while non-Trump supporters are evenly distributed among the supporters of more than a dozen other candidates.
But a poll conducted by the University of Monmouth in early September shows that in a hypothetical "one-on-one" competition between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always gets the support of the majority.
He is ahead of Carly Fiorina in 13 points, Marco Rubio in 14 points, Walker in 15 points, Jeb Bush in 19 points and finally Randy Paul, John Casey and Chris Christie in 33 points.
He has nothing to do with Ted Cruz.
Is it the only candidate that ignores him?
Ben Carson rounded the businessman up to 19 points in a hypothetical "one-on-one" competition.
More than half of Donald Trump’s supporters say they have changed their minds.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday showed that only more than half of Trump-backed voters said they were confident in their votes.
Obviously, a lot can happen and change the situation, and no one can actually say that he never changes his mind.
46% say they leave the door open to other candidates.
However, Trump’s most tense competition at the moment is with fellow outsourcing neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they’ve changed their mind are likely to choose Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "violent" two months ago in his campaign opening speech, the issue of immigration has become the most up-to-date in talks in 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump’s posse will deter key voters of Latin American descent from the Republican Party and prevent rebranding.
But according to an ABC/Post poll on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration is attracting public attention, it seems that Donald Trump will remain in the same position.
Disappointment by the government is gaining new turnover.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now counting on support for about half of Republican voters, mainly because of their status as outsiders.
Six out of 10 Republicans in a new ABC/Post poll on Monday said they wanted a political outsider rather than a person with experience working in the government.
They are also offended by Washington.
The Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll in Iowa, two weeks ago, shows that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are disappointed by the Republicans’ activities in Congress, with 54 percent “dissatisfied” and 21 percent “in anger.”
The government will decide the fate of pension indexation in October.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Olga Golodets said that the government is now looking for options to implement the law on the indexation of pensions in 2016 to the real level of inflation.
She noted that a decision should be made by 8 October, at the time of submitting the draft budget for the next year to the Government.
In addition, the cabin discusses the option of extending the decision on the freezing of the accumulative pension of the Russians.
Golomet noted that the amount of pension accumulations is equal to 350 billion rubles.
It is about the same amount of full pension indexing for the next year.
According to the deputy prime minister, there is not yet a final decision on who should pay contributions for non-working citizens.
Hodeet believes that if a person does not work on his own initiative and does not belong to the socially unsafe categories of citizens, it is not fair that society pays for him.
Earlier, the media reported that the cabin is considering two options for balancing the state budget.
Why are the ages often irritated and reddened?
Answered by ophthalmologist Tatiana Levashova:
Our centuries are screens that protect the eye apple from the many small particles that sit on it.
Forgetting about the regular cleansing of the ages, we often contribute to the development of blepharitis ourselves.
Exit is simple:
Do not wash your eyes with dirty hands, wear a special wet wipe for centuries;
at least 1-2 times a day clean the end of the century from the accumulated in them for a day of harmful substances.
Cleansing procedures are not necessary to supplement and warm compresses with herbal herbs (salphs, rhubarbs), diluting the thick secretion of the sebums, and then massage the edges of the century, which should be carried out with circular movements of the pillows of the fingers;
by washing makeup, do not use alcohol-containing products.
They dry and dehydrate the skin and contribute to even more thickening of the secretion of salivary glands.
Pyongyang claims that Korean nuclear weapons have created a nuclear warhead.
The North Korean authorities said the country’s main nuclear reactor – the nuclear complex in Yonben – is operating “at full power.”
This was reported on the website of the Central Telegraph Agency of the country.
It is noted that North Korea is ready at any time to respond to “the U.S. aggression and nuclear threat,” and that the country has improved its nuclear weapons “both in quantity and quality.”
The last nuclear-weapon test was conducted by North Korean authorities in 2013.
At the same time, no plans to resume the full operation of the reactor have been reported since.
Pyongyang claims that he managed to create an atomic warhead.
Also, North Korea has conducted tests of medium and short-range missiles several times, writes polit.ru.
Zhirinovsky demanded that the mention of fraternal peoples be removed from the Russian anthem.
LDPR leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky believes that the mention of the union of fraternal peoples should be removed from the national anthem.
This was stated during the meeting of the State Duma, reports the Russian News Service.
Who are these people now?
Fascists and murderers.
“A very long anthem, the longest in the world, even athletes can’t stand it,” Zhirinovsky said.
The deputy considers that it is necessary to delete all quarters containing the following line:
In the summer of 2014, Zhirinovsky stated that the current anthem should be changed to "God, the king of guards", and the Russian tricolor replaced with the imperial flag, writes polit.ru.
Assad called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Syrian President Bashar Assad has called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Assad is confident that if Europe wants to deal with the problem of refugees, they must stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The question is not whether or not Europe accepts refugees, but whether the root causes of the problem need to be addressed.
If the Europeans care about the fate of the refugees, let them stop supporting the terrorists.
This is our opinion on this issue.
"This is the issue of refugees," he said in an interview with RT.
We must continue the dialogue in order to reach consensus.
However, if we want real success, they are impossible as long as people die, as long as bloodshed continues and as long as people don’t feel completely safe.
"In this way, we can reach a consensus, but we can't do anything until we defeat terrorism in Syria," Assad said.
Some 500,000 migrants have arrived in the European Union this year, including from Syria.
The European Commission has said that the current migration crisis in the world is the biggest since World War II.
It is not excluded that among the migrants arriving in Europe there may be thousands of militants of the extremist group "Islamic State".
Members of a terrorist organization banned in Russia can use the situation to create their own cells in the EU to carry out terrorist activities.
The residents of the German city organised a holiday for refugees.
Over the past month, Germany has become a leader in the reception of refugees, although recently it has stepped up border controls to deter their influx.
According to the authorities, some 800,000 migrants will arrive in Germany by the end of this year, although some experts call the figures significantly higher.
Since the beginning of September, more than 90,000 refugees have arrived in the country.
BBC correspondent Jenny Hill visited the city of Darmstadt, whose residents provide a very warm welcome to migrants.
Jeremy Corbyn debuts at the Prime Minister's Question Session
After Mr. Corbin's election, his debut at the Prime Minister's session of questions is eagerly awaited
The new Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn will be speaking for the first time at the Prime Minister’s session, for the first time measuring forces with David Cameron.
Mr. Corbin will address the first of the six questions raised in the second half of the day; his speech is likely to be closely monitored by the press and members of Parliament from the Labour Party.
He called for "less theater and more facts" in a weekly demonstration speech.
He also said he could miss some meetings, leaving them to colleagues.
The meeting will be Mr. Corbyn’s first parliamentary test as a leader; it will take place after the appointment of his shadow cabinet and his speech at the annual Tread-junion congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader’s decision to remain silent during the performance of the national anthem on Tuesday, during the celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle for Britain, has sparked criticism from a number of conservative MPs and has become the subject of several advanced articles in the newspaper.
Mr. Corbin's decision not to sing the state anthem attracted attention
Mr. Corbin said he was "standing in honorary silence" and recognized "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle for Britain".
However, Corbyn’s shadow cabinet member Owen Smith told BBC Newsnight 2 that he would advise the Labour leader to sing the national anthem “regardless” of his belief in the need to abolish the monarchy.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers refused to play in Mr. Corbin’s team, expressing disagreements on economic, defence and international politics, while less than one-sixth of the MPs supported him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says political disagreements are also "cut with a halt" in the Labour Party after Mr Corbyn's appointment to office in the European Union and the government's restrictions on compensation payments.
Mr. Corbin said at the Trade Union conference that the Labour Party had made amendments aimed at repealing the idea of restrictions as a whole.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, shadow labor and pensions minister, said there was "complete clarity" in the party that it was in opposition only to the government's plans to cut the upper limit from <0xC2><0xA3>26,000 to <0xC2><0xA3>23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron will meet at the “courier box” in the last ten years since he became the leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader, who promised a different approach to politics, says he "attracted collective resources" to raise the ideas of Mr Cameron's questions and received more than 30,000 proposals.
A member of Parliament from the County of Illington North said that the Prime Minister's questions are causing excessive confrontation, and that he will also refrain from sharp answers and exchange amounts, instead promising to focus on serious issues, such as non-poverty.
Mr. Corbin said that Angela Egle, Minister of Economy in the shadow cabinet, would replace him on the Prime Minister's questions when he would be absent - for example, when Mr. Cameron was abroad.
He also voiced the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor whenever possible, saying that he was addressing Speaker of the House of Commons John Berkow to discuss the matter.
Becoming a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said he wanted to step away from the political style of the “mere ballad”, often associated with the Prime Minister’s questioning procedure, but admitted a few years later that he failed to do so.
Since the first broadcast in 1990, the Prime Minister's issues have become a key indicator of the leader's views, their ability to manage the House of Commons and the reputation of other members of Parliament, although critics say that this has become a cartoon and requires large-scale reforms.
"Dreamed in Yoburg" Homeless young people who learned from photographers
The business center of Johannesburg is a difficult place for homeless people.
But a group of ex-supervisors found a way to master the craft and earn a living.
“I was shot in Yoburg” is a non-profit studio that trains homeless young people to take pictures of the surroundings and earn money on it.
BBC News met one of the first graduates of the project.

The pound sterling is growing as wages grow in the UK
The pound grew against the background of wage growth in the UK, while the FTSE 100 index rose thanks to an offer to buy SABMiller.
From May to June, earnings in the UK, deducted from bonuses, increased by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
The growth rate was the highest since 2009, and was seen as a shift to an earlier forecast for possible growth in quotes.
The pound rose by more than 1% against the dollar and amounted to <0x24>1.5505, and 0.84% against the euro, amounting to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose to 6229.21 by 1.49%.
Overall, SABMiller shares were highlighted, which grew by 20% thanks to the purchase offer received from the competitor AB InBev.
The deal would unite two of the world’s largest breweries, bringing together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry’s stock grew by 0.9% against the backdrop of encouraging news from a competing group of luxury goods producers in Richemont.
The latest Richemont sales figures exceeded all expectations and showed that sales in China – in the key market for Burberry – began to grow again.
Glencore’s shares grew by 5% after the mining giant said it had managed to get <0x24>2.5 billion by placing the shares, which was done as part of its debt reduction strategy.
Mondi's paper and packaging group's shares were the leaders in the index - 4.3% - after Goldman Sachs lowered the group's rating to "sell".
Shares of JD Sports grew after the sportswear company reported an 83 percent increase in pre-tax earnings in six months to <0xC2><0xA3>46.6 million.
JD Sports CEO Says Higher Wages Could Prevent Expansion
JD Sports CEO Peter Caughill said that raising the minimum wage for British workers means "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
But it is unlikely that such purchasing power will outperform the increase in labour costs, he says.
Costs could have affected plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could mean a reduction in the number of additional vacancies.
Metcash Launches Downside Initiative Campaign to Fight Aldi Pressure
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from the pressure of Aldi in South Australia and Western Australia.
The food wholesaler on the initiative below has launched a campaign to protect the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in light of the upcoming <0x24>700 million investment by Aldi.
While Aldi is preparing to open two wholesale warehouses and the first of 120 stores in South and West Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relationships with local suppliers of food products.
IGA retailers and suppliers, such as the ice cream maker Simmo's from Dunsboro, which offers a tasting in IGA stores, and store owners selling discount tickets to regular customers for the South Australasian Football League matches.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its security strategy on September 29, the day when this wholesale food, alcohol and commodity supplier will hold its annual investor strategy day.
Much has been put on the horse, as in South Australia and Western Australia, IGA-branded stores account for almost 30% of all Metcash stores and show higher profitability than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Buyers in South and Western Australia are known as adherents of conventional routes, so the market here is more favorable for IGA retailers than in the states of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in the UA and 24 percent in the WA.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will occupy 5 percent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening its first stores, taking the volume of sales from all players present, but mainly from independent retailers.
In a report published this week, Tom Kiratt, analyst Morgan Stanley, believes that IGA retailers could lose <0x24>360 million in sales per year, and Metcash - <0x24>250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA next year and 30 stores in WA, reaching sales of <0x24>500 million and <0x24>600 million respectively in these markets.
Losses in revenue and sales of food products at a high level of constant costs could cost Metcash about 13 million revenues before paying interest and taxes, Mr. Kirat said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing its market share in the eastern states, mainly because of Aldi and Coles, while a recent study by Morgan Survey found that IGA has the most loyal buyers.
According to Morgan Stanley, sales of Metcash food will fall 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017, and 2.1 percent in 2018, reducing the company’s market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, senior fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of Magellan Financial Group, noted at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash "is highly likely to disappear for a decade.
Metcash declined to comment publicly on Mr. Douglas's comments.
But a member of Metcash's board of directors is believed to have contacted Mr. Douglas last week.
The IGA market share has declined from 18% to 14% since 2010, and Metcash’s revenues from the food business, which the company supplies to approximately 1,200 IGA retailers, have fallen by 43% compared to 2012 due to operational devaluation and sales pressure.
However, the company does not give up, spending more than <0x24>150 million annually to equalize retail prices with prices in Coles and Woolworths for a thousand positions per week and helping retailers IGA is more product-oriented in the remodeling of retail stores, as well as offering a wide range of products.
Metcash CEO Ian Morris says price levelling and refurbishment of trading venues are gaining turnover, and hopes the company will achieve a net profit increase in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Tanasi Cockkinakis is backed by Tennis Australia President Steve Hilly
Tanasi Cockkinakis deserves praise, not criticism for her behavior.
Tanasi Cockkinakis has been indirectly injured in the recent scandal surrounding his friend Nick Kiryos and deserves more respect for his behavior than critics, Tennis Australia President Steve Hilly said.
Cockkinakis, the youngest in a talented duet and often called "Special Ks", was involuntarily at the center of attention due to Kiryos' shy intercourse with Stan Vavrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Shortly thereafter, during a hot qualifying match in Cincinnati, the judge at the summit had to smash Cockkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice, while Harrison said, "The warrior had to put the blade on Kiryos' blades, and I had to put the blade on that blade."
Since the last time Cockkinakis saw the racket breaking after the shock in his leg saved Richard Gasquet from a possible defeat at the US Open, Hilly is loyally defending Cockkinakis.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Grot for the right to be second in the singles division in the Davis Cup semi-finals against the UK.
“I am deeply concerned about one thing, the fact that Tanasi was involved in the conflict,” Hilly said.
He really broke the racket when he got a leg at the US Open, but he wasn’t the first player to break the racket when hopes broke, and I know Tanasi well enough to be sure he wouldn’t be proud of it.
But in fact, he did very well in rather provocative situations in the US, with Harrison, and so on, and I’m sure he deserves to be trusted.
He's surrounded by a great team, he's got a great family, and I just think he's been a little unfair.
He is a very mature 19-year-old man, he works a lot, fits perfectly into the team, he has never had problems with other players, he is respected outside the court, he is intensively trained, he is in excellent shape, he is very ambitious and developed young man, and I think he appreciates what he follows.
Hilly also supported the decision to forgive Kiryos for an important game starting Friday, believing that "mutual agreement" was the right choice for everyone, but expecting the guy from Canberra to return to the team as a long-term player.
"First of all, we want the team to be fully focused on the game, not on the fights around [Kyros]," Hilly said.
And I think Nick's got the strength very quickly, it's what people like Federer and Marrey prove, he's growing up in the eyes of the public, he's made a number of serious mistakes and he deserves all the criticism he's got, but we're trying to help him understand, and he's got it.
Migration Crisis in Europe: Hungary Announces Emergency, Closes Border, Detains Migrants
With the state of emergency declared, Hungary closed its border with Serbia on the southern border on Tuesday and detained those who are trying to enter the country illegally to stop flowing inflows of migrants.
There were riots at the border - hundreds of migrants gathered in the border area, to which the Serbian authorities reacted sharply negatively.
Trapped indefinitely on the road between the two countries' checkpoints, the people fleeing armed violence at home broke tents and settled in the area.
However, dissatisfaction increased.
When a police helicopter roared over them, migrants shouted "Open the border!" and shouted insults to the Hungarian police for a special purpose.
Some of them refused to eat or drink in protest.
Serbia’s foreign minister has declared “unacceptable” the expulsion of migrants back from Hungary, as more and more of them come from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of the solution to the problem, not the accompanying damage.
It is necessary to hold negotiations with Brussels and other countries in the coming days," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The tensions at the Hungarian-Serbian border began the next day after a bloc of 28 countries failed to develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to bear a common responsibility for 40,000 people seeking asylum in overcrowded Italy and Greece, and expressed hope that in the future (in the next month or by the end of the year) an agreement will be reached, according to which the Member States of the European Union will be 120,000.
Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday called for an emergency EU summit next week to discuss the continent’s immigration crisis.
Hungary, however, does not expect urgent action on the part of Brussels or its neighbours.
The state of emergency in the two southern regions on Tuesday gave the authorities more power to act on the crisis, allowing them to block roads and accelerate judicial cases on asylum.
Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Peter Siyarto said his country plans to also erect a fence from a wire rope at the Romanian border to block the flow of migrants through the country, now that it has finished the fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie Dagata said that even the detainees were connected to the urgent work to complete the fence from a wire rope between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become the main “strict place” and crossing point of the EU’s border for displaced people, many of whom are refugees – victims of wars in Syria and countries of the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insists that the majority of people arriving in the country are economic migrants seeking a more prosperous life, not refugees - victims of wars that have the right to be defended, and this point of view is sharply different.
The new laws, which came into force in Hungary at midnight, now consider the crime of crossing or damaging a 4-metre (13-foot) fence of a velvet wire built by the government along the southern border with Serbia, as well as including the walnuts for more.
“Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring an emergency,” said government spokesman Zoltan Kovac in the southern city of Seged.
We make it clear that crossing the border illegally is a crime.
Formally, the parliament still has to sanction the deployment of military forces, which is expected next week, but Associated Press reporters who are at the border are already watching the presence of armed tooth soldiers with vehicles and vehicles there for several days.
Djerdi Bakondi, Orban’s national security adviser, reported the arrest by authorized authorities of 45 people who tried to cross the border, at the border itself, and another 15 people, inside the country.
They crossed the border, broke the fence, are currently in police custody and are accused of committing administrative violations under the new laws.
The authorities are quickly restoring the fence.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven crossings on the Serbian border on Tuesday morning, pushing to block one of the crossings of a railway wagon wrapped in a rope wire.
The riots exploded on the main crossing of the border near the city of Ríosk (Hungary) as the Hungarians placed an office space for people to pass inside a metal container, and crowds of people pushed each other to break in.
Approximately 20 people managed to penetrate, with thousands remaining outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway leading from Serbia to Hungary, and announced a waiver of food and water until they were missed in Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton’s advantage over Bernard Sanders has doubled in national poll
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a two-digit advantage in the Democratic race for nomination across the country, but Senator Bernie Sanders is pursuing it.
Clinton now has 47 percent support among primary Democrats voters (down from 58 percent), and Sanders is second with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is going to take part in the presidential race, receives support from 15 percent of primary Democrats.
More than five months before the start of the competition in the primary elections, the majority of Democrats say it’s too early to say they’ve decided with the candidate they’re going to support.
Clinton’s supporters are more confident in their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll last month, Clinton has lost support from some demographic groups, and Sanders has gained some bonuses.
Clinton holds a large advantage among women and moderates, but this advantage has diminished.
Her support among men has declined significantly, and Sanders is only 5 points behind her.
Clinton’s preference for Democratic voters under the age of 50 has disappeared, and they and Sanders are now on equal footing.
However, Clinton still has a big advantage among older voters.
Last month, Clinton beat Sanders to a two-digit number among liberals, but Sanders now has a five-point lead in the group.
Almost half of primary voters across the country say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were to become a candidate for the party.
A quarter would support her with some reservations, and another 15 percent would support her only because she is a candidate.
Six percent would not support it.
It may not be surprising that current Clinton supporters are likely to show more enthusiasm for her.
Among those who do not support Clinton at the moment, views are more contradictory – only about a quarter would enthusiastically support it.
While 48 percent of primary Democrats say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, a smaller number of Republican voters say the same about their leader, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton’s supporters are asked an open question as to why they want to see her as a candidate, the most popular answer is that she has the necessary experience (16%), then that it’s time for a woman president (13%), and that she’s the best candidate for that position (10%).
Clinton’s supporters also talk about the association linking it to Bill Clinton (9 percent).
It is also called Consent on Questions and Opportunities for Election.
As the vice president is considering potential election participation, 57 percent of primary Democrats would like him to join the race—although a third considers that he should not.
When asked who they would like to see in second place among party candidates, primary voters-democrats in most cases call Biden.
More than half of Clinton’s supporters say they would choose Biden as second, which is more than Sanders’s.
If Biden decides not to postpone his Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton’s advantage over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Biden among race participants to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chances of winning the general election, but that figure dropped from 78 percent last month.
According to this indicator, Biden with a large second behind, but the percentage of those who consider him the most likely candidate has increased.
However, responding to the question that most importantly in the candidate, Democrats choose other options than the chances of being elected.
Similar to last month’s situation, none of the candidates from Democrats or potential candidates are an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Candidates from Democrats, or potential candidates, have shown a good result on some key characteristics among primary voters from their party.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders, and Biden to be honest and trustworthy people with good leadership qualities.
Biden of all three leads in honesty, and Clinton’s strong side in her leadership qualities.
Thirty percent of primary Democrats don’t think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as much as those who say the same thing about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don’t have a certain opinion about him in that regard.
Primary Democrats also generally consider the ideological views of Clinton, Sanders, and Biden to be similar.
According to all these measures, about a quarter of Democrats voters have no opinion on Sanders.
While questions about Hillary Clinton’s personal e-mail box and server continue to be her secretary of state, most primary democrats are satisfied with her explanation for this account and believe that it did not negatively affect their general opinion.
But this is a completely different story for the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans today are dissatisfied with its explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
The public’s opinion on this was shared in March, shortly after this story became known.
Most Americans say the e-mail controversy hasn’t affected their overall opinion about Clinton, though 36 percent say their opinion about it has deteriorated.
Most of them are Republicans, more than six out of every 10, who claim that their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton considers her party’s voters to be fair and trustworthy, it continues to be a problem for her among registered voters as a whole: only 32 percent consider her to be fair and trustworthy, eight points lower than in the past 15 months.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters do not consider it fair and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 registered voters across the country do not consider Trump to be fair and trustworthy.
Both Clinton and Trump, however, get good marks on leadership qualities.
Of the six contested candidates Biden, Carson and Bush show the best results in fairness.
Most people see an honest man in Sanders rather than not, but, like Carson, many have no opinion about him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 primary Democrats voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson’s National Survey Closely Approached to Donald Trump
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in CBS/New York Times poll
These two candidates picked up half of the voters in a new poll, leaving everyone else in search of support
Republican voters across the country continue to massively support Trump, whose support rate increased from 23% in a recent CBS poll held on the eve of debates on Fox News last month to 27% in a poll conducted on Tuesday.
But Carson took off for the same period from 6% to 23%.
The poll also showed that Carson enjoys support in all demographic groups, stalking Trump in the Republican electorate group with higher education.
Other candidates, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Cassich, resigned with Governor Scott Walker, whose support fell from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Haqqabi and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are ranked third together with 6%.
The error rate for sampling from 376 Republican voters in this latest poll is 6% plus-minus, the poll was conducted in September.
A recent CNN/ORC poll published last week showed Carson's growth in polls - showing 19% support among Republicans, behind Trump with 32% support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll also showed that Trump is significantly ahead of Carson.
In connection with Carson’s growing support last week, Trump made several critical cases against a former neurosurgeon, even when Carson apologized for questioning Trump’s faith.
“We need energy,” Trump said last Saturday during the closing of the campaign in Iowa.
Five members of the fraternity accused of the death of Baruch College's first-class student
Approximately two years after the college student died during a ritual of dedication in the Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, a murder charge was filed against five people.
"Members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood of New York College Baruch violently attacked Chan "Michael" Deng during the dedication ceremony in September 2013 and did not bring him to the hospital in time, which led to his death," the police said.
Officials say that a student with his eyes tied and a 30-pound backpack with sand on his back pushed several times as he tried to reach the goal by sliding on the surface.
Mr. Deng eventually complained that he had a headache and then fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood did not call 911 when Deng lost consciousness, and were supposed to wait another hour before he was taken to the hospital, police say.
They, however, took time to change Dengue’s clothes, find his symptoms on Google, and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the Brotherhood, to ask for advice, as police chief Chris Wagner told a press conference.
“At this point, the members of the fraternity began to hide personal property, essentially putting the fraternity’s well-being above Michael Dengh’s health,” Wagner said.
He could not be saved, and he died the next morning.
According to the discovery report, Deng suffered several absurd injuries to the head, thighs and thighs.
“Too many families have suffered as a result of rituals of devotion to the fraternity, as at least one student dies during them each year, starting in 1970,” said Douglas Feuerberg, a lawyer representing the Dengue family.
The brothers and their members must bear responsibility, and this step by the authorities is very important.
The counties of Monroe were in favor of a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Meng, will be charged with violence over newcomer and criminal conspiracy.
“We want to bring to justice not only individual participants, but if there is an organization that has officially or unofficially sanctioned all of this, then it too,” Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the fraternity, and the national fraternity excluded the local branch from its structure.
What will happen when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates?
There will be an increase in rates, and the bull market will crash, the yield of bonds will increase, and the economy will fall into recession.
That's what we know.
What we don’t know is how long it will take before the attack, and how long it will last.
In particular, history explains little about time.
The recession occurred just 11 months after the first rate increase and for a total of 86 months.
The rigidity of the Federal Reserve in raising rates often, though not always, determines the reaction of the economy and financial assets.
Therefore, the U.S. Central Bank administration is so insistent that investors should not focus on when it will begin to raise rates, but on how much adaptation will take.
In fact, there are many variables in the game.
In the end, however, market participants may find that the whole sluggishness around the increase in rates turns out to be exaggerated.
"The first rate increase by the Federal Reserve with the onset of the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal of the end of the era of "cheap money," said Julian Jessop, Senior Specialist in International Economy at Capital Economics.
On the contrary, we do not expect that the gradual return of interest rates in the U.S. to a more normal but still lower level will be a seismic impulse that many fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no consequences.
Here’s a look at how some areas of the economy could react depending on historical trends:
As you’ve seen the market in the last month or so, expectations of rising rates can lead to instability for a while.
When you raise the bet, however, the consequences are usually not so dramatic.
“It doesn’t seem that stock earnings will slow for 12-24 months after the first leap, which again likely reflects a delay in monetary policy,” said analysts at Deutsche Bank in a recent study of the Federal Reserve’s rate increases.
More specifically, the market has changed more frequently in the last 35 years Bar Management is about 14 percent in the direction of the increase in rates, it remains quite flat for 250 days after that (average growth of 2.6 percent), then, after the end of the 500 days, the balance of the balance, returns to the normal state, with an average return of 14 percent.
Deutsche says the result for securities tends not to become more pronounced immediately at the rate increase stage, and the income from shares begins to fall.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but higher rates often play a role in them.
In this case, the Federal Reserve is placed in conditions that did not exist before and can accelerate the recession.
Basically, the gross domestic product will be almost at its lowest point throughout the existence of an increased rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 cases, the increase in rates since 1950 was only twice the nominal annual GDP below 4.5%.
Even though it was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few believe it is long, while in the third quarter it is only 1.5 percent, according to the Atlanta Fed.
An increase in rates on such a volatile economic background could be risky and raise the question of whether it will be different this time, Deutsche said.
Market participants are preparing to raise rates by the Federal Reserve system all year round, with their views tied to the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could have approved an increase in rates at this meeting, futures trading is talking about only a 25 percent likelihood.
“In our study since 1950, all of the rate hike cycles to date have been in a supercycle of increasing GDP leverage, covering peaks ahead of recession very quickly after the start of recovery,” the report said.
By contrast, it was an extremely slow recovery after the worst recession in the chosen period.
The current cycle at the moment is the longest that the Federal Reserve has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record is 35 months, lasting 74 months and not yet finished.
Fixed income has also become volatile while the market expects rates to rise, and this scenario in some way resembles the one that is implemented for stocks.
The fundamental difference is that for bonds the effect will come faster than for shares when the Federal System changes the strategic course.
In the case of bonds, it seems that the return changes the vector immediately after the first increase/decrease in the cycle.
At the end of the rate increase cycle, the yield of bonds immediately falls,” Deutsche said.
Strategic experts from Charles Schwab believe that rising rates will bring long-term and short-term bond yield levels closer, making the curve flatter.
High-yield bonds often behave better in such a climate, although “we are still afraid of yield fluctuations,” says Katie Jones, a fixed-yield analyst at Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to the expected outcomes of the federal system’s policies.
“In addition to strengthening the dollar and falling inflation expectations, there are signs that the market has adapted to the perspective of a more rigid monetary policy,” she wrote.
Interest rates on short-term loans have risen, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have expanded, volatility has increased - all the characteristics of the market with the tightening of the Federal system policy.
Generally speaking, the companies that run their main U.S. business will benefit from rising interest rates, and local products will become more attractive.
International companies with multiple debts will be in the worst position as the growing dollar makes their products more expensive in the world’s market space, and their debt more expensive in the financial.
“History shows that ‘quality’ shares show greater market efficiency within three months of the initial rate increase,” Goldman Sachs analysts said in a customer report.
Firms with a stable financial position were overlooked by companies with a volatile position as a result of each rate increase in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital returns, as well as shares with low volatility, also showed better efficiency than shares with low quality, on average by 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Duty will be a big issue.
Companies with high interest rates of floating interest will lose the most, according to Goldman.
In addition to purely stock exchange transactions, consumers will benefit from the growing dollar.
Investors could see profits also through higher returns, although experts disagree on how quickly this will happen.
"BBC Radio 3 - Copy of Classic FM", - approves MP from Conservatives Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham has criticized the station for "decreasing standards"
It proves that it is becoming less and less distinct from a commercial competitor
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying the award was simply shared with the Brits.
Parliamentary colleague Damien Collins, who slammed The Voice with the same criticism, was not original
“BBC Radio 3 is turning into Classic FM,” the MP said, encouraging the television company to prove that it is doing at least something that commercial companies don’t do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC that the public radio station seems to be "stupid" and is becoming less and less distinct from its commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word 'simplification' - but it seems to be turning into Classic FM," he said.
He was also targeted at the BBC Music Awards, which was launched in December.
The BBC Music Awards, which launched last year, looks like The Brits under a different name.
So if you’re trying to do something different, here are two examples that first came to mind, in which you’re actually just copying what’s already on the market,” Mr. Bingham said.
The BBC's director-general rejected the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and audience education.
What I’ll learn thanks to Radio 3, I won’t learn about classical music anywhere else.
And his loyalty to live performances and the creation of music is not really comparable to anyone else.
"It's also really very important, I think, the interest of Radio 3 in finding new music and in promoting new works," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 manager Alan Davey claimed that the radio stations had to work much more to attract audiences than in the past because the British were less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only BBC child to be attacked for attacking commercial competitors during the hearings of the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sports.
Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice, a talent music show that the BBC bought from Dutch Talpa Media for an approximate price of <0xC2><0xA3>22 million.
Do you see why this program is often discussed due to the lack of originality and distinctive features?
Lord Hall claims that the BBC show 1, in which Paloma Fate and Boy George play as judges, was made in the "typical style of the BBC".
He added that he wants the Corporation to “find a hit in its own home booth” the next time it launches an entertainment project.
However, it does not consider it necessary to hinder ordering new seasons of The Voice in the future or using the money of those who pay the license fee for other entertainment formats.
Internet sales growth slowed as fast as possible in August, and it may be due to Black Friday
In the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%
Last month saw the slowest growth since it began to be observed in 2000.
Online sales increased three years ago due to the use of mobile devices for shopping
Experts are convinced that November’s Black Friday could contribute to deterrence of spending
For about a decade, virtual shopping has been booming, turning many of Britain’s central streets into ghost cities.
But experts say there are now signs of online sales leveling, after the latest data showed only a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total online shopping expenses in August showed minimal growth since they began to be fixed in 2000, up only by five percent.
Experts say there are now signs of online sales alignment, after the latest data showed only a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
“If you look at the growth rates in previous years and go back to 2000, they’ve always found a reasonable explanation,” said Guardian Andy Malkeshi, editor of IMRG’s sales index.
He explained that online sales were accelerated three years ago when buyers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that even more people had the opportunity to buy online, and that they could do it under any conditions, for example, sitting on the couch.
But now it’s on the plateau, and you can see a decrease (growth).
The Black Friday phenomenon, which came from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the slowdown in sales.
Experts believe that buyers could refrain from buying on the eve of the event, which takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, buyers in a number five times more than the average rushed to computers to manage to take advantage of profitable offers, thereby overturning a number of vendors’ websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when buyers enter the real fight for profitable purchases, could have forced people to refrain from shopping.
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, a little more than 1 pound out of every 5 is spent online.
As for products such as TVs and washing machines, more than one-third of them are sold through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online more hunting than in fashion stores in the central streets.
Muslims are buried in the fall of the crane in Mecca, and Ben Laden’s family are sanctioned
Muslims cross the bodies of 29 people killed in the streets as the first funeral begins in Mecca
At the same time, Saudi Arabia partially blames construction giant Saudi Binladin Group for accident
The Ministry of Health reported that a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapsed.
Hundreds of Muslims from all over the world climbed the streets to bury 29 of the victims who died as a result of a crane crash into the main mosque of Mecca.
Weared mainly in white, those present at the funerals overlaid the passage to pay tribute to the first of the dead who set out on their last journey at the Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
The sad procession passed through the holy place, where just a few days earlier the construction crane pierced the ceiling of the mosque and fell on the hallway.
The bodies were issued for the funeral, and the king of Saudi Arabia fined a construction company belonging to the Ben Laden family for an accident that also injured 394 people.
The bodies of 29 detainees who died in the crane crash in the main mosque, carried on the streets
Among the dead was the father of four children, Casim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when a crane crashed.
Mr. Akram was at the Main Mosque with his parents before the annual Hajj began.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hajj in Mecca will continue as thousands of people continue to arrive in the city.
King Salman said today that the Binladin Group should not have left the arrow of the crane raised when the crane was not working.
The Arabic version of the decree, published by the state agency Saudi Press, says that the Binladin Group is partially guilty of the collapse.
The British news agency did not disclose the details, but reported that the company’s leaders were banned from travelling outside the country.
Earlier this week, Salman had promised to find out the reason for the crane to fall in the courtyard of the main mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were stranded to go to the Hajj this month.
Binladin Group made no statements about the crane collapse and its representatives found themselves unavailable to comment.
The Royal Decree also accused the company of not using modern security measures and inadequate agreements with the Meteorological Service.
Dozens of cranes surround the main mosque of Mecca, as part of the large-scale construction that is conducted by Binladin Group.
The bin Laden family has been among the closest ruling families of Saudi Arabia for decades and is leading the largest construction projects.
The late al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was the alternate son whom the family abandoned in the 1990s.
The accident occurred with strong winds and rain just a few days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom to participate in the pilgrimage, which is mandatory at least once in life for every working Muslim.
Officials said 158 people remained in the hospital.
Officials have decided to pay one million riyals (approximately <0xC2><0xA3>174,000) to relatives of the deceased, and the same amount irreversibly to the deceased.
The other victims will receive half of that amount.
B&Q chief claims that the trend is due to the presence of Eastern European masters working for little money.
According to Veronica Lori, the British are increasingly hiring repair specialists
The number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe is growing.
The result is the opening of more than 200 new Screwfix stores for professionals
Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores all over the country

They say the British put aside the hammers and paintbrushes, and instead hire qualified Eastern Europeans to do the work in the house.
If you know how to handle a hammer or paint the walls, it seems that you are a minority nowadays.
Because, according to the owner company B&Q, the British are increasingly hiring specialist masters to do the easy work at home.
Veronica Lori, the new Chief Executive Officer of Kingfisher, which owns the network of home decoration services, said the trend is behind a significant influx of qualified masters from Eastern Europe offering services at minimum prices.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open another 200 Screwfix stores specializing in craftsmanship, and close 60 B&Q stores at the same time.
Ms. Laurie said she would like to see more women in B&Q store staff, as eight out of ten shopping decisions in the store are made by low-income women.
Currently, most of the staff are men.
According to her, the recent demographic trends, characterised by the growing number of households consisting of single women who are more engaged in the renovation of their homes than in the past, cannot be ignored.
Mrs. Laurie said: “Our stores are still mostly men’s.
Steps need to be taken to achieve balance.
Overall, half of our customers are women, and 80 per cent of decisions about goods are made by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Ms. Lori, one of five leading British companies whose shares are included in the FTSE100 index, also changed the composition of the top management team, becoming among the directors of equal numbers of men and women.
Kingfisher is almost the only company with just 50 percent of its managers - women, including its CEO and financial director.
Laurie said: "It was a conscious decision, diversification is an important issue for us.
Finding suitable women on the board of directors was not difficult.
After the group took on the costs of closing the stores, Kingfisher showed a decrease in profits and sales in six months.
As a result of this trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q brands, opens 200 new stores
Time of decision on the rate of interest of the US Federal Reserve
The world is watching the meetings held by the Federal Reserve Bank, which discusses the most important decision within two days, whether or not to raise the interest rate for the first time in the last decade.
A survey of 80 economists conducted by Reuters found that just over half of those who believed last week that the Federal Reserve would go to it now believe it would still be timely and keep the rate at the current range of 0-0.25 percent.
This is a historic event, as it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve lowered the rate to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching the fact that the main bank can move from zero mark and start the process of normalizing interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, a senior employee of the Peterson Institute of International Economics.
The U.S. economy is working efficiently, the economic rise adds trillions of dollars to the balance sheet, and inflation is small.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore how the decision will affect the world economy.
He warned the markets that they should be prepared for change, but everything speaks of their confidence that all chances are against such a move.
The decision will be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday.
The new Balkan route: Refugees go to the EU via Croatia.
“Open!” – hundreds of refugees are chanting at the Horgo<0xC5><0xA1> checkpoint on the Serbian-Hungarian border.
Since Tuesday, Budapest has crossed the border for displaced people.
Asylum seekers are already beginning to explore other options of routes to the European Union.
One of them in circumvention of the closed border with Serbia lies through Romania.
The other - through Croatia and Slovenia - to Austria.
According to some data, buses that took refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now heading to the city of Shidu on the Croatian border.
Drivers were ordered by the authorities to follow without stopping.
Serbian Interior Minister Neboysha Stepanovi<0xC4><0x87> assures that his country is doing everything it can to help refugees, but its capabilities are limited:
Our job is to secure Serbia as much as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people to ensure a humanitarian attitude towards them.
But this is already a pan-European problem.
It is not easy to solve it, no country in Europe can handle it alone, and even more so a small country like Serbia.
Belgrade asks Budapest to open the border for refugees who do not want to stay in Serbia.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said:
If someone is called a refugee, in Serbia he must fill out the necessary documents for this.
And if he does not do so, he will not be allowed into our country, because it is quite safe in Serbia.
Hungary has already erected a 175-kilometre fence on the border with Serbia.
But Orban has no intention of stopping it: he plans to raise the same barrier on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already stated that this is incompatible with European principles.
Vangelis Meymarakis: “Europe wants to help us.”
Vangelis Meymarakis has been part of the right-centered government for several years, which, according to the left, has led the country to a financial crisis.
Now, he has become the interim leader of the New Democracy Party, challenging Tsipras.
A few days before the election, he met with a journalist, Euronews.
Euronews: Mr. Meymarakis, welcome to Euronews!
Vangelis Meymarakis: Thank you for your invitation.
Euronews: Nine months ago, your party suffered a devastating defeat by surrendering to the Syriza coalition, but now, according to polls, “New Democracy” has been compared to it in popularity.
What has changed over this time?
Vangelis Meymarakis: Greece has changed, and so have we.
Mr. Tsipras lied a lot in January last year.
Nine months ago, Greece had budget surpluses and economic growth prospects.
The country has a budget deficit and a high level of unemployment again.
Investors left because Mr. Tsipras drove them away.
In the last nine months, the Greeks had the opportunity to assess the situation in which the country was in January and the false promises of Mr. Tsipras.
And now they can easily compare what was promised to what actually happened.
Everyday life has gotten significantly worse compared to January, when the situation improved, and this was the case for most Greek citizens.
Euronews: But you are saying that if you win the election, you will seek alliances with other parties, including SYRIZ.
Vangelis Meymarakis: The thing is, as we have understood in recent years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
And it is no coincidence that in all the other countries where rescue programmes were or are still in place, political forces and all ruling parties gathered together to implement the program they agreed on, without giving up their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that at this stage, only the cooperation of political forces and institutions will allow the country to move forward.
Euronews: Your party has voted in favour of the agreement between Mr. Tsipras and the creditors of the country.
If you become the new prime minister on Monday, will you enforce this agreement, or will you try to change it at least in part?
Vangelis Meymarakis: In fact, we voted for Greece’s move on the European path, because we have a good idea of the detrimental consequences of the country’s exit from the EU.
Europe is now helping us by providing subsidies to our farmers for their products, we have solidarity funds, the Juncker package and assistance in the banking sector.
All this would have been lost if there was no treaty with Europe.
But the current measures of hard savings were the result of Mr. Tsipras's negotiations.
I know that Europe does not want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe sees that during the first year the new Greek government wants to bring order to power, operates rationally and makes it clear that the country has a strong political will to implement the salvation program, then it may be a prelude to the fact that, I am sure, all the commitments that have been taken are not possible.
It would be wrong to assume that in the first year of the new agreement, we will be able to return to negotiations with our creditors, as they are awaiting full implementation of the agreement.
If we want to restore their trust, we must continue the privatisation, the reforms and the structural changes that have been agreed upon, continuing to take advantage of the benefits of EU funding and the great investment opportunities that we must open up for better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, during the negotiations, the Government of Tsipras has not made any serious arguments on many key political issues, which we have found out when discussing these issues with our European colleagues.
I can give you an example of farmers’ income.
We have explained to our European partners that this is not a fixed monthly income, and therefore it cannot be fully taxed in advance.
We were told that Tsipras’ ministers never spoke about it.
That is, the Greek ministers were not prepared and misinformed, and therefore failed to negotiate and concluded a failed agreement.
Euronews: If you win the election, you will soon be at a table with Mr. Juncker, Hollande, Mrs. Merkel and other European leaders.
Will what you tell them differ from what your predecessor Antonis Samaras told them?
Vangelis Meymarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that by the end of 2014 we have tried best to implement the 2012 agreement by circumventing the sharp corners in it.
We've been pushing for reform.
Of course, we lacked the necessary decisiveness and speed, but we acted in extraordinary circumstances.
The market fell, and there were no prospective buyers willing to pay the price that the Greek government agreed to pay.
I was a Speaker of Parliament at the time, and I was able to agree on the views of the three parliamentary groups, which were then the government majority.
And despite their serious ideological disagreements on key bills, we had a working parliament, and this is in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations that took place outside.
And we managed to bring the country to a normal situation that would continue to improve if the process had not been interrupted by the early general elections that resulted in the December presidential elections.
Euronews: A mass flow of refugees has been circulating in Greece in recent weeks.
What do you think of this situation and the reaction of the European countries that these people are looking for?
Vangelis Meymarakis: The refugee crisis is a slow-moving bomb that we have to deal with after we win the election.
And the reason is that the Syrian government did not act in this situation as it should.
In such matters, you should act in advance, because if the problem hits you, there are only emergency measures left.
And we're in that situation right now.
Even the interim government that replaced SYRIZ did more in just seven days than Mr. Tsipras did in seven months.
I am sure that these actions of the interim government, which is being helped by the President of the Republic who called for the EU summit, will allow us to find a solution.
We need to see how many refugees will be able to leave the country, and note that refugees are not illegal immigrants.
These are the victims of the war in Syria, the victims of some extraordinary events that happened to them.
This issue has a profound humanitarian aspect, and we will adhere to the position that European politicians must adopt in this new situation.
The decision should be taken at the EU summit and the United Nations should be involved.
We also need better coordination of action, more effective border controls and refugee reception centres.
We also need to make effective use of the economic assistance we receive from the EU in order to be able to deal with this urgent problem.
Euronews: Mr. Meymarakis, thank you for the interview.
Vangelis Meymarakis: Thank you.

Man who opened fire at Delta State University, left a note with an apology
After shooting and murdering his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning — and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day — Shannon Lamb wrote a note that says he is "repentful" of the first murder, and he wants to "repent."
Police in Gothenburg, Mississippi, reported that a professor of geography and social sciences at the State University of Delta called 911 at about 10 a.m.
On Monday, he said he had shot someone.
Lamb told the manager that the police had to send people home to him.
He said: "I killed my wife last night," and also mentioned that there is a "dog" in the house that "doesn't shake anyone" but is probably upset.
The police asked him the name of the person who called, but he didn’t call him.
Lamb didn't explain why he opened fire.
Upon arriving at the scene of the crime, police found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, saying, "I'm sorry I'd like to get everything back.
I loved Amy and she was the only one who ever loved me.
In a note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history teacher, and killed himself on Monday evening, when he was surrounded by police.
William Laforge, the Rector of the University, said he was unaware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Mr. Lamb clearly had something in mind."
Despite Monday's information that Lamb suggested a romance between Prentiss and Schmidt, official services on Tuesday reported "lack of any information or evidence" of a "love triangle".
Prentiss was referred to as a "good man" by Sean O'Stin, who said he had been married to her for about seven years.
They divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Ston said he and Prentiss had a daughter of 19 and that she was "unhappy".
He added that Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Lindsey Knowles, which the newspaper San Gerald calls a close friend of Prentiss, the latter worked from home via the Internet.
Wells said Prentiss had a hunting dog called Lightning, and that she had been dating Lamb for about three years.
Wells said, "She always wanted to help people."
According to the police, Lamb called relatives on Monday at some point to say that "he will not go to prison."
That same evening, when police reached him on Highway 1 near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, jumped out of it, ran into the woods and shot himself there.
According to a summary posted on the university website, in the spring of 2015 Lamb received a PhD in pedagogy from the State University of Delta.
Stars who have lost their luck
The actor (left), in a photo with his son Redmond (right), survived several difficult years.
In 2001, he struggled with leukemia, and in 2009, he lost his long-time partner Farru Fosset, who died of cancer.
The actor was reportedly also suffering from drug addiction, and in 2008 he was arrested for keeping drugs.
All of this certainly played its part.
Manchester United's Luke Show has been out for several months due to double break
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places during a Champions League match in which Manchester United lost PSV to Eindhoven.
While the defender is worried about this, which will cause him to be unable to get out on the field for at least six months, Louis van Gale hopes the Show will be able to play again this season.
The injury occurred during the unreasonable hit by Hector Moreno in the 15th minute, when a 20-year-old Show broke into the PSV penalty zone.
He was assisted in the field for nine minutes and given oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gale said, "He has a double fracture, and he's in the hospital."
He will be transported to Manchester tomorrow or later in the day, and then prooperated.
"It's terrible - the young man came to Manchester United at the age of 18, overcame great difficulties and started playing fantastically, and that's where it happened.
There was an oxygen mask in the dressing room.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it's six months, and the guy can't play in the group stage.
I hope he will be able to play again this season.
Moreno was fortunate that he did not receive the red card and was not appointed a penalty.
Arbiter Nicola Rizzoli did not punish a Mexican.
Van Gall believes that the Italian judge has made a mistake.
Judge for yourself when I say it's worth a penalty and a red card.
It was a very bad two-legged sock.
Shaw tweeted: “Thank you all for your messages, not describing in words how devastated I am, my path to recovery is starting, I will come back even stronger than I was.”
Manchester United suffers unhappiness with Luke Shaw after losing to PSV
The English defender will have an additional incentive to advance to the European Championships in France next June.
Phillip Coco, PSV coach, said: "It's a very serious injury.
When any player gets out with such an injury, everyone is very upset about it.
It was never the intention of our players to hurt the enemy.
Moreno broke his leg when he played for Mexico against the Dutch team led by Van Gall at the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very difficult for him now because he didn't intend to hurt the opponent, and when you hear that it's a very serious injury, you feel bad," Koku said.
I couldn't see the moment myself.
The only thing I could see was the ball that flew in the other direction, so it looked like he (Moreno) touched him, but I didn’t see a podium under Luke.
In an interview with SBS6, Moreno said, "I know what it is, I know how hard it is to bear.
It's very hard for me, and I'm so sorry.
Andrés Guardado of PSV was also taken to the hospital after a collision with Chris Smolling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about Lorax?
Every parent learns one thing very quickly: if your child liked a book, it will take a little while before you get to know it almost completely.
Apparently unless you're David Cameron.
Responding to a question from a representative of a company that organizes children's holidays, about his favorite children's book, the prime minister chose "Larox" - a fairy tale with an ecological inclination, written by Dr. Suz in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron wrote in a comment posted on the SuperCamps website, and continues, “This fun, touching, unusual story with a strong message I love to read to my children because it always has a misunderstanding, a misunderstanding, or something in it.”
And everything would be fine, except for the last paragraph, in which Cameron is supposed to recount the contents of the book, but actually tells the story of the film of the same name, shot in 2012, with new characters and details added to the story.
"In the high walls of the city of Allennuzville, where there was no greenery and even air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey - the girl of his dream, the dream of her dream, the dream of her life - to see the real tree," - reads.
If this doesn't seem suspicious enough, Cameron's text is read almost as a brief summary of the story of the film "Larox", posted on the Internet Movie Database website: "In the high walls of the city, the All-Night-Wild is a swarm of swarms, where everything was artificial, and even the air was sold out.
It seems unlikely that Cameron, being, in general, an active parent, is so unfamiliar with the contents of the book, in which the unnamed boy learns about how to destroy the environment of the dungeon (the dungeon) is "a craving for the tree, a craving for the "tree" and the squirrel.
Most likely, such an uncomplicated PR task was entrusted to the performer, who has never read a child’s book about Lorax 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text allegedly came from the Cameron office in the constituency.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text came from Cameron’s headquarters, but no further comments followed.
Adam Litt was clearly at risk of not joining the England team, but it is still a difficult question.
Victory over Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is not an easy task, but if you look at the team England selected for this tournament, a repeat of the 3-0 defeat in the test series that happened last time, I don’t think it’s likely.
I wouldn’t rule out victory in my field either.
The team of Alistair Cook may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but it includes players who take virtuous balls, and collective thinking is strong; they will not bring scars from 2012, but only a youth position.
With the ball, Moen Ali turns into a bowler serving the rounded balls, and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown figure for the test level, is an attacking option.
Adam Litt Resigned from England in Test Cricket and Replaced by Alex Halez
The decision to remove Adam Litt for me, his head coach at Yorkshire, is of course difficult to analyze.
In his seven test matches, he faced two good attacks in difficult conditions, and the obvious but cruel reality is that cricket players are judged by the referees as a result.
There were no questions about John Ruth, for example, which led to this announcement, because (and I’ve said it before) players choose best for themselves.
The couple were half-hundred, and Lita could have waited for a longer career, but he was in power of his own destiny.
We hope that if he gets more wounds for Yorkshire, there will be another chance.
England's head coach, Trevor Balliss, had a good look at his mood, even when he didn't show what he was capable of, and that doesn't surprise me; he's a team player first and then everything else.
The question of how long it will take for the test cricket batsman to leave an impression of himself is a complex question.
Lit played in seven games, like Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton at nine.
Only Compton had a chance to play on his or her own field.
The only thing you could complain about is that England chose Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean Premier League when Lit was in the best shape, but this opportunity was lost in the past.
There's Alex Hales, and he's a batsman that I highly appreciate.
He’s an unpredictable cricketer that we saw at the Yorkshire Club at the beginning of the season when he won 236 games against us at Trent Bridge, which was something already.
He should at least be given the same opportunity as those who were before him, but it will, of course, depend on the team in the UAE.
The idea of putting Mohan next to Cook as the opening batsman, which would give the opportunity to introduce an additional spinner while keeping four speed boolers, is thought-provoking, and I'm not against it at all.
I don’t see why a batting player can’t hit the ball there, and this left has already shown that he’s a damn good cricketer.
Moen may not be exactly what he needs for his county of Westershire, but he has become the third number for them, and there is no big difference here.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 test matches with the "third batsman" before coming out as the opening player in 2001.
He won three hundred at once and did not look.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a backup spinner, and in my brief communication with him he seemed to me a very promising young man.
People can look at his exemplary statistics – on average 31 with a beating and 35 with a ball – and think it’s a risky bet, but among spinners who vote “for” a little, and voters chose youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
In addition to the team, England plans to make a couple of practical additions to the coaching team.
The appointment of Maheela Jiaouordin, a Sri Lankan batsman, as a test match consultant, could be a workshop move.
He is one of the best guys for the game, which will bring in the richest experience gained in all possible conditions and in any attack.
Paul Collingwood is included in those games where the white ball is used, and will provide both energy and ruthless pace in the stage.
I have always felt that he was born to be involved in international cricket, be it a game or a coaching job, and like Machela, he has a lot of intelligence.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room, even if they say what has been said before, can add new strength to the team.
Colli's colleague Darema Ben Stokes has been left for one day, Ruth has been given a similar break with Australia, and I, for example, do not have any problems in this regard.
While not everyone agrees with this, coaches and people who select players do not set a schedule.
And you should remember, as players, their positions depend on the results.
Such decisions are never taken easily.
Britain’s outgoing supporters camp could win if the economy is depressed by 2017
David Cameron’s reckless policy of resuming Britain’s EU-preservation negotiations is becoming more and more difficult every day, even without looking at the election of the genius Jeremy – “Is this yes or no?” – Corbyn’s Labour leader or TUC’s outrage
Foreigners also have their own Corbins and Nigel Farage.
A friendly European diplomat explained at the time that, in the situation in which the EU is now experiencing a variety of crises - not all of them of its own production - some participating countries are dissatisfied with the basic of the British egocentric agenda, the ranks of those who are undergoing a breakdown and error.
Meeting in Brighton at an annual meeting, TUC decided that he would not want them anyway if they destroyed social protection.
We could even call it "Dave and George's selfie program."
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance ride through summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, photograph themselves against the background of a famous local monument, in a company of local celebrities or without it, then come home and say they are attracting allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants Britain interested in maintaining foreign contacts under the European Union tent - "Don't leave us together with France," says Berlin - suggests that the depressed ministers and officials in some of the capitals, or we have been left to understand when,
Angela Merkel, Germany’s very cautious Chancellor, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before the situation worsens for her, as she has worsened for those who have settled in her place: Thatcher (11 years), Mitterran (16) and Kolya (14).
French President François Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's losing power too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist government of right-wing, Spain of left.
It’s hard to see them leaping out of the skin to help the selfies whose energy could be spent preventing Scotland from leaving the UK – which they don’t want either, because most have similar separatist tendencies.
So some such ministers may even plan to release deliberately useless SNP-style remarks during the 2017 UK referendum campaign to boost Britain’s exit from the EU, my friend suggests.
"The revision was an idea-fix" and "Britain received nothing valuable from the resumed negotiations."
Europeans know what a predator Flyt Street might be, and how skeptical media magnates are about the EU, as opposed to the time of Tony Benn’s 1975 referendum, which supported our 1973 admission by a 2:1 ratio.
They may be reminiscent of Boris Johnson, a rooted Euro-portunist, who was famous for his "direct EU bananas" of the Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
With all his stupidity, Ed Milliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a peach company of frightening tax collectors, phone hackers-foreigners, and pseudo-unresidents who own most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair was exactly the same about them, but he realized that when you’re in a cage with a big gorilla, you have to give her bananas to distract her and not let her eat you for lunch and again with tea.
In fact, Millebrand was a greater fan of Blair than Blair himself in opposition to Cameron’s idea of a referendum, as Blair advocated the principles of a repealed EU constitution buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005.
The press didn’t forgive him.
But mileage Jeremy Corbyn, who kindly stabbed me in the back at Westminster on Monday - I told him he didn't have time to spend it on me anymore - seems to risk repeating Neil Kinnock's '80s 'boycott' strategy.
It may take some time, but he needs to develop a consistent strategy of interaction with the press — not with me, but with Andrew Marr, on whose air force couch he was sitting on Sunday.
Corbyn’s official position on Europe is what I delicately call evolution.
He says he wants us to stay in a reformed EU.
Indeed, most people outside of the Ukip traditionalist tendency and a wider circle of “Small England siders” among Torahs can probably say yes to this.
It's the same as Hilary-"Benn, but not Bennite," Benn said on radio and TV this week, with his internal boycott refusing to admit that Corbyn's appointment as "Shadow" Finance Minister was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s, when his old father was on TV for disloyalty to his colleagues in the Labour cabinet, not going too far and not losing his position in the cabinet of ministers.
The Battle of Hilary was more attractive.
But the struggle to stay “under any circumstances,” Benn said, was not what McDonnell said, and not what J.K. told Paris and MPs at a private meeting on Monday night, according to the general opinion.
Whatever the Democrat and his “boy” Corbyn wanted to report there, remember, even me, the discipline of messages remains important in the age of 24/7 television, especially in the waterways of social networks, the foyer of paranoia and betrayal.
It makes sense not to let Cameron so easily separate from Europe, allowing him to accept the support of the Labour during the referendum campaign, McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But the main mistake of McDonnell and Corbyn about EU membership - within the "Bennite" economy of the besieged fortress - is no longer a question of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for whom narcissism, born in a minor difference, is a central principle.
As for his mistakes about NATO – Tom Watson unshakable that JK will not agitate for the exit – foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to report it to their leaders at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend their political capital – they also have suspicious voters – on Britain’s concessions, when all this can be pointless?
The U.S. is already very disappointed by the weak military actions of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even though the Tory government is cutting costs in power, as I was reminded Monday during lunch at a forum called British Influence Security.
Experts Criticize E-Cigarette Review from Public Health England
Statements by the government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking were heard at the meeting of 12 people, some of whom are related to the tobacco industry, the researchers reported.
Experts published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) in conjunction with Lancet criticized the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their e-cigarettes report.
PHE published an important report – a “reverse summit” last month, calling it “a comprehensive review of evidence.”
But some researchers questioned the credibility of the data and pointed to the connection of some experts with the tobacco industry.
In an editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month, they criticized a “extremely funny argument” on the basis of which PHE built its main conclusion.
In the BMJ article, two other researchers asked whether these statements were “solid or false.”
Martin McCain, professor of the European Health Organization at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, reported: "The fundamental principle of health is pre-requisite."
According to them, the public expects PHE’s statements that “the current best estimate shows that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than tobacco smoking” were based on a detailed study of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this is derived from a single meeting of 12 people who gathered to develop a model of multi-critical decision-making analysis in order to summarize their views on the harm associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting are briefed in a scientific publication.
McCain and Capwell reported that one of the group’s sponsors was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO was reported to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
He also confirmed BAT certifications in the health sector in the Sustainable Development Report.
One of the 12 people at the meeting announced funding from the e-cigarette manufacturer, not mentioning the funding he previously reportedly received from the tobacco company Philip Morris.
There was no reasonable explanation for the selection of board members, but there were several well-known e-cigarette supporters, some of whom also claimed industry funding in the publication.
It is not known whether the other participants of the meeting had experience in managing tobacco.
The meeting was also attended by the head of the tobacco industry at PHE.
The scientific paper, published by the group, "sharply agrees" that there is a lack of "weight proof of the adverse effects of most products on most criteria," wrote McCain and Capewell.
However, none of these links and restrictions were affected in the PHE report.
McCain and Capwell said PHE’s statements that “at the moment there is no evidence that e-cigarettes are expensive, children’s or non-smokers” are premature.
Prof. Kevin Fenton, head of health and well-being at PHE, said BMJ’s statements had already been answered.
He said: “E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than tobacco smoking.”
One of the two smokers died of his addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health threats from e-cigarettes are relatively small, but we need to continue to study the distant consequences.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public of what they prove and what they do not prove, especially where the public has doubts about the relative danger of tobacco.
Approximately 80,000 people die each year from smoking-related diseases, and smoking costs the NHS <0xC2><0xA3>2 billion per year.
Clearly, although e-cigarettes are not safe, they only do part of the damage caused by smoking, we are doing our tasks before the nation.
Ex-Channel 4 CEO Says BBC Should Stop EastEnders
Former Channel 4 chief Luke Johnson believes the BBC should stop releasing programs like EastEnders and The Voice, noting that their business competitors would give up a lot for such successful shows as the soap opera on Albert Square.
Johnson noted that license fees should only be used to create programs that are not released by other British broadcasters.
He criticized the BBC for putting public broadcasts, which probably only a small part of the audience watches, at the peak of the time when competitors go on a show with high ratings, and on channels like BBC4.
After BBC CEO Tony Hall said the corporation would like to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson noted that he had unsuccessfully tried to co-operate with the BBC while working on Channel 4.
“I can’t stand the idea that the BBC is preparing for launch and broadcasting broadcasts that could show competing companies that don’t receive subsidies,” Johnson told members of the House of Lords Communications Committee as part of exploring the future fate of the BBC.
If you keep a license fee that I do not consider a good solution in the medium and long term, then the company should leave in the air only those programs that are not released and will not be released by other companies.
The Voice show is on the air in a premium slot because creators want to get as much support as possible for the future.
The idea that no one else would show it is ridiculous and obviously absurd.
Johnson: “I don’t understand why regressive taxes should go to fund transfers that could be sponsored without subsidies.
The Voice - one such example, EastEnders - another; it is commonly known that they are of their own production.
Other channels would undoubtedly give away a lot for her.
I don't understand how this can be a public broadcast.
I don’t think that’s going to humiliate the BBC.
Serial entrepreneur Johnson, who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC of pursuing ratings “because of the ambitions of employees and their belief that this is the best way to get support for the long term.”
His comments on the most popular shows on the BBC are backed by comments of Sky CEO Tony Bolla, who in his 2003 lecture on the memory of McTaggart in Edinburgh suggested the BBC to sell EastEnders series.
Johnson noted that more niche BBC broadcasts of a public character "continue to go to BBC4, where it is often not possible to evaluate the audience, but the function of the company is performed, and this can be presented as an argument in the Hanseatic sermons that are not the case, the "exaggeration of the proceeds from the licensee".
They put them in a slot where no one will ever watch them.
On the licensing fee, Johnson told the committee: “I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of who gets the most from it.
Of course, you all think, we all think that 150 pounds a year is a huge sum, but for people for whom 150 pounds is a lot of money, I'm curious, they think so because they don't really watch and listen to the BBC.
Former CEO of Sky and Channel 5 channels, David Elstein, who also spoke before the committee last Tuesday, said the BBC should review Rita's mission in favor of "information, education and entertainment."
He noted that now only a small portion of the BBC’s released material is formally classified as educational — he said, 1% of the television content and 0.1% on the radio — and that the company should take the initiative of the Australian and Canadian broadcasting companies, through the "deviations" of the broadcasters.
On partnership issues, Elstine noted that the BBC should make more efforts in areas such as "Prominent Concerts" (only some of them, he said, are shown on TV), as well as joining alliances with commercial broadcasting companies to make them available for online viewing.
"Sonogenetics" allows you to control brain cells using sound waves
The video shows how nematodes change the direction of movement at the moment they are exposed to sound impulses.
Scientists have removed worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can be controlled using sound wave pulses.
Small nematodes change the direction of movement when they are affected by sound impulses that are too high for the human ear to hear them.
Impulses are influenced by the activation of genetically modified neurons to use membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
Researchers Control Brain Activities With Light <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Scientists have said that worms demonstrate the possibility of a new method called “sonogenetics”, which is to use ultrasound to stimulate certain brain, heart and muscle cells, while the source of ultrasound is located outside the body.
Shrikant Chalasani, a scientist at the Solka Institute, La Hoya, California, told the Guardian that this method could one day replace deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure that is used in the human brain, which is sent electrically and immunely.
Nematodes don't usually react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they started reacting when they were placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
He found that the bubbles amplifie ultrasound waves, which then penetrate the body of worms.
Increased ultrasound waves affect structures called “TRP-4 ion channels” found in the membranes of some worm cells.
Ultrasonic waves cause these ion channels to open and excite the cells that are associated with them, the report reported in Nature Communications.
To create nematodes that can be controlled by ultrasound, Chalasani made genetic modifications to worms, so their motor neurons used TRP-4 ion channels.
During the use of ultrasound to influence modified organisms, sound waves were amplified by microscopic bubbles and entered the worms, activating modified motor neurons.
This methodology is similar to that applied in "optogenicity" - a new direction that allows scientists to turn on and off neurons by means of light pulses.
Chalasani argues that compared to this method, sonogenetics can have some advantages.
Unlike the light that is delivered to the right part of the brain by fiber optic, low-frequency ultrasound waves pass through the body’s tissues unhindered, so they do not need to pass inside the skull box for delivery.
“We believe that for the treatment of certain neurological diseases in clinical conditions, the use of gene therapy and therapeutic viruses will be able to temporarily make human neurons sensitive to ultrasound signals,” Chalasani said.
He added that, in addition, the method can be applied to muscle and insulin-producing cells.
Prohibited torture equipment is right on your threshold!
Advertising scams over British arms trade
Watch Amnesty International’s protest against the Arms Exhibition.
Amazing killer drones!
Destroying the skulls of iron candles!
Cassette bombs!
Electric light-noise ducks that cause unbearable pain, but do not leave traces!
The bold voice and cartoon animation leave no doubt that this advertisement of the largest international arms show is a vivid parody prepared by Amnesty International in order to draw attention to the intention of the British government to "turn" the weapons into the repressive regime.
DSEI Arms Exhibition: Authoritarian regimes go to London
But the special campaign also leads to the sudden appearance of many posters at bus stops and in subway trains, which require to look at them again.
"An important announcement going on the DLR line from September 15 to 18?" is written on one of them by the London Metro with a DLR line that turns into a tank silhouette.
In September of this year, a crowd of arms dealers will warm up to the DLR line. Passengers are asked to help prevent the arms exhibition.
300 posters are painted by artists who exhibited their works in the "Museum of Cruel Design" at Banksy's Dismalland Park.
A group called the Special Patrol Group helped spread them across London, using a 6-pound set of hammer keys, which is said to "give access to about a third of the advertising space on bus stops."
Londoners are not happy with such “vandalism” in the form of unauthorized posters.
One of the parodic announcements issued by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Greendon, curator of the exhibition Cruel Designs and a teacher at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more demanding and strive to bring political art to audiences outside galleries.
Many artists start working with protest activists, realizing that they have to go out into the real world for their art if they want to influence society.
Another poster against the arms exhibition, welcoming the passengers in the subway.
The video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the pro-bono agency VCCP, with a graphic designer and voice artist also working for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was impressed by the advertising silence around the arms show – with a leak in the ExCel calendar – and thought, “Let’s set them up a campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They thought of creating more realistic and ruthless corporate advertising, but “filling her home with bright colors and animation turned out to be a more exciting activity.”
“They’ve been incredibly helpful in attracting attention to the sale of illegal torture equipment at the exhibition,” said Tom Davis of Amnesty.
Now we need the UK government to take action and ensure that this torture equipment will not be illegally sold directly at our threshold.
Perhaps the most creative art on the subject of the arms exhibition comes from within ExCeL, where the participants trade fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed information about the order for "AT4CS RS for shoulder shooting" received from the U.S. Army.
It includes “a non-analogous cumulative warhead that brings unsurpassed reserve action within the goal.”
Whatever he does, it won't be nice.
Eight golden rules of living in student dormitories
It’s been 11 years since I moved to a student dormitory as a normal 19-year-old man still believing in berets and moral relativism, but it’s only now that I remember the tense smiles of those I’ve annoyed – and numerous long complaints about others.
Basically, what I’ve learned can be broken down by eight simple rules.
The transition to the dormitory can vary from slightly acting on the nerves to absolutely frightening.
He encourages you to talk: tell people where you came from, where you took your academic vacation and where you took it, whether you support Corbyn, and why you're "honest, I don't love, I don't hate Marmait," because, seriously, guys, it's just a yeast extract.
Go ahead.
And help others to overwhelm you too - ask questions and show interest.
This supports conversation and helps you find people you like, not those you wouldn’t even talk to, even if you had your eyelashes burned and they were distributing fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People’s rooms often turn into drinks, midnight cinemas, and places of public tours, but they’re also a place where people dress up and fix their underwear.
Don’t even think about starting your studies at a university when you’re in a relationship.
Introverts in universities are treated unfairly.
Your room should be a haven, but many dormitories form a culture of walking from one room to another, which promotes friendship, communication, and leads to long-standing friendships.
This could be hell for those who are trying to restore strength.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want to continue to be friends with you, but I need you to leave, and I'm able to recover the energy I spent on communicating with you."
Try to feel when a fellow student is tired of communication - and not touching him, but texting.
By the way, about the touch: do it.
One guy in my dormitory followed the principle: if the door was not locked, he was invited to enter.
He saw something.
Make friends with the help of baking.
As you start your university life at the peak of the popularity of the Bake-Off show, then knocking on the door to people to show up and present a plate of chocolate cake is no longer a strange thing to do, it's not like you're talking about, it's not like the 1950s, it's like their "Beautiful cake."
Offering home meals is a great way to make friends.
Your neighbors will feel obliged to talk to you, and in the end, your face will likely be associated with them with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on how good you are a baker.
Poorly blind slices of flour, sugar and fat will rather make people pretend to be asleep when you touch them.
Food theft is a typical crime in student dormitories.
Of course, the assignment of someone's chicken is a robbery, but is it a robbery - to take a little bit of milk for tea?
Go to the owner of the milk.
He'll probably suggest you not to be shy, even if he's infuriated.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and I sympathize with you - but try to deal with this adult than my neighbor, who poured his dishwasher liquid into her milk to avenge those who took it without asking.
She's in jail now.
You should not make noise that will prevent people from sleeping or learning.
Not only to be a decent person, but also because you are the same people from the Glass House proverb.
The girl in my corridor asked the neighbor to make the sound of the drum and bass guitar, since it was 3 o'clock in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
In response, the neighbors increased the volume.
When he finally shut up at 5 a.m., she kindly allowed him to sleep for two hours, then rubbed his music and locked the door behind him, going for a three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future husband lived in the same dormitory as you?
On the contrary, wouldn’t it be extraordinary, before the elbow bite, indiscreet, if you would take a neighbor for your future husband, get involved with him, break a relationship, and should be seeing him every day, and perhaps watching him drag on to his side of all your generals?
Of course, you won’t give a heart – but if the hot neighbor is definitely not your future husband, try to cool your own dust a little bit.
At the exciting moment when you realize that someone has left the keys inside their own locked room, the boundary between the game and the trawl is thinner than it seems.
A good joke is fun, but it turns into the opposite in a few seconds.
Teach a valuable and interesting safety lesson by hiding something – but never pack anyone’s room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock someone’s door and drop the keys into a glass of water that you will then put in the freezer – but don’t glue someone else’s stuff with a Blu-Tack glue to the ceiling more than twice.
iOS 9: How to Install a New Operating System on iPhone After Releasing an Update from Apple
You can request a new operating system by going to the Settings app, select General, and then - Software Update.
When it is ready, the phone will allow you to download and install it.
Some have encountered problems after installing, when an error message appears telling them that "Application update failed".
To avoid this, users are advised to either wait until the revival is stopped, or try to update through iTunes.
The tips on the phone will allow you to go through the whole process until the end.
The process may include removing apps to increase free space – but Apple has minimized the likelihood of this action by reducing the size of the update, and has also simplified execution with a special utility that offers to remove apps and reinstall them after the process is complete.
It is worth making sure that when you update your phone is charged or is next to the charger to prevent battery discharge.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop the update, as the phone’s unloading in the process may cause the update to fail.

Washington responded to Russia’s military activity by telephone.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
According to him, the military support that Moscow provides to President Assad is only aggravating the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House is not going to talk about it yet with a Russian colleague, writes PJ Media.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss Russia’s military activity in Syria.
This is reported by PJ Media.
“Secretary Kerry made it clear that the further support of President Assad by Russia creates the risk of exacerbation and prolongation of the conflict, as well as negatively affects our common goal – the struggle against extremism is not the power of the State of the United States – if we also do not continue to focus on the search for the country.
They also noted that Kerry once again stressed the U.S.’s commitment to combating “Islamic State” within a coalition of more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad could never be a member of it.
In addition, the United States "will be pleased with Russia's constructive role in attempts to counter the "Islamic State."
Last Friday, White House officials said they did not know exactly what actions Russian troops are taking in Syria, but Washington is going to discuss the issue with Moscow.
However, White House press secretary Josh Ernest noted that the time for a phone conversation between US President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin has not yet arrived: “When the president decides that the phone conversation with President Putin will be a mess,” and it will be in our interest.
Barack Obama himself believes Russia’s decision to increase support for the Assad regime is a “winning bet.”
I remember our conversation with Mr. Putin four or five years ago, when I told him that it was a mistake that further support for Assad would only make the situation worse.
"But he did not listen to my warnings - and as a result, the situation has deteriorated," the president said.
Imported yachts will be exempt from the payment of customs duties.
The Ministry of Economic Development intends to temporarily exempt imported yachts and other floating equipment for recreation and sport from the payment of customs duties and taxes.
The corresponding changes to the list of preferential goods for temporary duty-free imports were prepared by the Ministry on the orders of the Russian Government.
This was reported to Izvestia by the Assistant Minister of Economic Development Elena Laskin.
In June 2015, the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev commissioned a number of departments - Ministry of Economic Development, Ministry of the Russian Federation, Ministry of Culture, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, FSB, FTS, Rostourism - to prepare proposals for the creation of welfare
In turn, experts note that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for the storage, maintenance and maintenance of yachts.
Owners prefer to keep their ships abroad - about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 million annually go to execution of European states for the maintenance, repair and maintenance of yachts.
The Ministry of Economic Development of Russia has prepared a draft decision of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission "On Amendments to the List of Goods Temporaryly Imported with Full Conditional Exemption from Payment of Customs, Payment of Sport Taxes", which provides for the provision of Full Conditional Exemption and Payment.
According to the ministry, this will certainly contribute to the creation of favourable conditions for the development of yachting in the coastal areas of the country, - Lashkina noted.
This question was submitted to the Subcommittee on Customs, Non-Tarif Regulation, Protection in Foreign Trade of the Governmental Commission for Economic Development and Integration, whose meeting was held in September, and the outcome of the discussion was also approved.
As noted by the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development, the proposed measure on the full conditional exemption of imports is essentially advantageous.
Therefore, after approval of the minutes of the meeting of the subcommittee in the Government of the Russian Federation of Economic Development will submit a proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission for discussion with the EAEU member states, Lashkina explained.
In the list of imported goods, which are exempt from the payment of customs duties, taxes and taxes, are goods necessary for the promotion of foreign economic activity and international cooperation, for use in the field of science, culture, cinematography, sport and tourism, etc.
In the press service of the Ministry of the Russian Federation "Izvestia" have been told that they have prepared mandatory decrees on the seaports of Kerch, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosia and Eupatoria, which provide a simplified procedure for the design of boats, boats and boats.
Transmission is given the commission to the captains of the seaports of Crimea to ensure the application of simplified arrangements for the entry of small-scale, sports sailing and walking ships into the seaport and the exit of the listed ships from the seaport.
The Ministry of Transport has also prepared draft decrees of the Government of the Russian Federation on the approval of the boundaries of the waters of the seaports of Crimea.
With regard to Yalta and Theodosia, the orders have already been adopted, the rest are in the stage of agreement, - noted in the press service of the department.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol should carry out state oversight, classification and certification, and state registration of minority vessels used for non-commercial purposes.
The problem is that in Russia it is extremely difficult with yachting precisely because of the poorly developed infrastructure.
If you look to the south of Italy and France, then there is a whole constantly evolving industry in which a large number of people are involved.
In Russia, in fact, everything is in place.
Our coast is uninteresting, the only piece where you can operate yachts all year round is the Black Sea in the area of Sochi, Gelendzhik, Novorossiysk, Anapa.
But the great difficulty is that in this area the border service rules are extremely strict: in order to go on a yacht for a walk, you need to make a mass of permits.
In addition, inside Russia, the yacht is not even anywhere to sail.
Two days she can go with her fuel, and then there is a problem where to take it, says Nordmarine’s sales director Denis Novikov.
As for the storage of yachts, in Moscow and St. Petersburg there are now special hangars for yachts up to 30 m. Yachts are also sent for storage in Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
Novikov noted that yacht buyers are rich people, but with the onset of the crisis, the demand for yachts decreased.
The World Bank has granted Ukraine a <0x24>500 million loan.
The World Bank has approved a new loan project for Ukraine of <0x24>500 million for the development of the financial sector.
This was reported by the press service of the international organization.
“The new funding will support a number of priority measures to implement reforms in the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine,” the statement said.
The director of the World Bank for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, Zimiao Fan, said that banking sector reforms will help revive loans in the real economy and stimulate economic growth.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities have taken impressive steps to reform the economy and are seeing the first signs of stabilization in the World Bank.
But due to the seriousness of the problems, Fan is calling on the government of Ukraine to accelerate reforms.
Earlier, the Polish government approved the grant of a loan of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million to Ukraine, reports RIA Novosti.
Prisons are asked to create separate blocks for transgender people.
The Public Council at the Federal Penalty Service (FSIN) for the protection of the rights of convicted persons in October 2015 will discuss, among other issues, the possibility of creating separate blocks for transgender and transgender persons in the colonies.
"Izvestia" told the board member Vladislav Grib.
According to him, depending on the overall number of convicts in Russia who are not determined by sex, in domestic prisons it is possible to provide separate chambers, blocks or even (if there are many such criminals) in the prospect of creating a special colony for transgender.
However, Vladislav Grib stresses that it is possible to determine the punishment of citizens in such isolated places only after the convicts have undergone the relevant medical examinations, which will prove that the offender is indeed a person who identifies himself as an opponent.
Vladislav Grib is confident that isolating transgender persons from other prisoners will ensure the safety of those serving the punishment.
According to him, the proposed practice is successful abroad: in the SIS (where the defendants are before the decision of the court) there are separate chambers for transgender, and in the correctional institutions - special blocks.
This is the only way to deal with these criminals.
They must be clearly isolated, as the presence of transgender and transgender people in the ordinary chambers is dangerous to them, it is suffering for their families and a sea of problems for the FSIN staff.
The humiliations of the transs on the side of the roommates are guaranteed, - says Vladislav Grib.
Depending on how large a city is, how many criminals with an unspecified gender, you also need to calculate where to distribute them.
SYZOs are definitely not needed individually - only cameras, blocks in prisons.
Yes, a separate colony is possible if there are many transgenders.
As Grib explained, 50 or 100 people can be held in the block, and if a specialized corps will be created in Russia alone, then inmates will be able to pass the punishment there from any region.
Citizens are detained at the CISO on the scene of the crime, so the arrival of transgender or transgender from other entities during the investigation and trial is unrealistic, but here is how to introduce such a practice for those already convicted in a separate colony - yes, - according to Grib.
On the eve, law enforcement officials were unable to decide in which investigative isolator - male or female - to identify the detainee for the storage of drugs of 24-year-old non-transsexual Dmitry Kozukov (known as Alina Davis) was.
He was released home on a non-exit subscription.
This news has been widely discussed on social media and in the media, as the mechanism for the detention of transgender people in the CISO and the colonies in Russia is actually not yet.
Russian human rights defender, LGBT activist (LGBT - lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transgenders) Nikolai Alekseyev supported the idea of creating special places for punishment by transgender people, noting that their own lives abroad are also possible to identify people in the colony or male.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the offer is correct.
Yes, it’s a very small percentage, but the problem exists, as does the issue of security in prisons for homosexuals,” Alexeyev says.
Prisons should be safe, so individual blocks could be made on behalf of homosexuals, especially since they are more in prisons than transgender ones.
At the same time, Alexeyev doubts that there will be many citizens in Russia who are willing to give themselves up for transsexuals in order to get into a different colony from ordinary ones.
Of course, you can enter a medical certificate before you place people in a colony for transgender, but not always everything is unambiguous.
For example, in the U.S., one of the detainees, Chelsea Manning, looked like a man, and already in prison said he wanted to change gender, Alexeyev said.
A person can feel like anyone.
But while there are no separate places for punishment for transgender people, I doubt that prison officials will seriously think about the safety of such people and get into the subtleties of their orientation or gender identification.
At the same time, the international expert on reproductive health in the territory of the Russian Federation Boris Lordkipanidze noted that the introduction of a new system of distribution of transgender criminals in the colony could greatly delay the start of the execution of the convicts.
The commission is created - it's a question of sexology, psychiatrists conduct long-term observations, it's not one test on the basis of which a high-precision conclusion is made.
Today’s psychiatry allows for this.
Therefore, even before a gender change, potential patients always undergo such examinations - they show exactly whether a gender change with surgical intervention is the necessary measure, says Lordkipanidze.
However, it is difficult for me to imagine how to implement this system in relation to the convicts, because on average, it takes a month for such a survey.
The doctor, although in general supported the idea of creating separate blocks for transgender people, also doubts that in the current economic conditions it will be advisable to allocate funds for the construction of new premises, medical examinations, - transgender units in Russia.
It is difficult to calculate, there are no official statistics, but if you take into account that homosexuals in Russia about 5%, it can be said that transgenders are even less, and those who have such a deviation and even commit crimes, a very small number, - said Lordkipa.
Now upon request to the administration of the colony, homosexuals, transgender and so can get separate conditions of content.
Mikhail Antipov won the World Junior Chess Championship.
In Hunty-Mansiysk ended the World Chess Championship among juniors under the age of 20.
The end of the championship was more than intriguing.
The winner was determined only in the last round, and they were given by the Russian Mikhail Antipov, who managed to push the Polish Yana-Kshisthofa Duda, who would seem confidently go to the title.
The women's victory was celebrated by Ukrainian chess player Natalya Buks.
The World Chess Championship, held from the beginning of September in Khanty-Mansiysk, already in the middle of the tournament distance, seemed to have lost almost all intrigue, since the representative of Poland was the leader of the Yan-Kshishtof Duda system, who issued a series of four victories (
Given that Duda was the ranking favorite of the championship, and is generally considered one of the most promising young chess players, the likelihood that he would miss the score was very small.
And even when Duda slowed down the turn and allowed the Russian Mikhail Antipov to reduce the delay to just 0.5 points, he remained an obvious favorite in the fight for the title.
After all, Antipova, in order to reach the leader, had to win in the 13th round.
But it wouldn't even help if Duda won his game.
Plus, this commitment to victory, of course, could affect the game of the Russian chess player and lead to unnecessary mistakes.
Fortunately, Mikhail Antipov managed to avoid them.
He was confidently able to cope with Francesco Rambaldi, after which he was forced to wait for his party to be completed by Duda, who met Benjamin Bock.
Fortunately for Antipov, the Polish chess player faced the Dutch defeat.
Thus, Antipov and Duda scored the same number of points - 10 out of 13 possible, but Antipov had the best additional scores.
And that is why it is the leadership of the Khanty-Mansiy Autonomous District, whose governor Natalya Komarov, traditionally pays great attention to the development of chess in the region, awarded the main prize.
But in the competitions the girls did not have an intriguing ending.
The leader of the tournament - Natalie Bukse (Ukraine) - to win the title was enough not to lose in the last round, which she successfully did.
Thus, the victory of the Russian Alina Bivol did not allow her to reach the Bux.
The Russian athlete remained second with a 0.5-point delay from the championship.
It changes radically the regional structure.
The company combines the Privolz and Ural regions into one enlarged Volga-Ural region, Siberia and the Far East - into the East region.
The project will be completed by 1 November.
As Vympelkom CEO Mikhail Slobodin noted, the changes are being made to "remain a strong player in the market", to develop the company "in new, not always favorable external conditions".
In an interview with the TV channel "Russia 24", Mr. Slobodin clarified that they intend to cut "ten percent" of staff in Russia.
Rospotrebnadzor checked 78 Moscow Burger King snacks and issued 367 prescriptions.
As a result, the restaurant on the Volokolamsky Highway was fined 50 thousand rubles, and the establishment on the Great Tulskaya Street was closed for 90 days, but resumed work after eliminating all violations.
Thirty-three restaurants violated the requirements of the premises.
Among other violations, unsatisfactory sanitary-technical and sanitary-hygienic content of the premises, non-compliance with the requirements for the ventilation device, in some institutions, bacteria of the group of the intestinal rod have been detected.
The franchise on the Burger King brand belongs to Burger Rus Ltd., owner of the network "Chocoladnitsa" Alexandra Kolobov, there are 293 restaurants operating in Russia.
Igor Artemyev, head of the FAS, said that the agency against the indexation of 10% of tariffs on freight transport and state subsidies, as requested by OAO RZD.
At first they wanted 17% of the index, now they want 10%, and even billions of subsidies from the budget, he says.
We’re saying: it’s wrong, it’s too much, reduce your costs, learn to save, give up expensive mansions, football teams, your own TV, stop spending money left and right.
He added that the FAS has its own, "much more stringent" proposals, which are now being discussed in the government.
Polymetal is considering a possible net version of the calculation with Sumeru Gold B.V. instead of executing a path option for a full <0x24>300 million share, the gold mining company said.
In this case, Polymetal will have to pay Sumeru up to <0x24>80 million (the difference between the price of issue of shares in favor of Sumeru and market quotes), which can be taken from the free cash flow.
Sumeru has until October 3 to implement the option or to require additional payments.
The details of the talks in Polymetal are not disclosed.
The option was closed as part of the purchase of the Polymetal project "Kyzyl" in Kazakhstan.

Minpromtorg: direct food aid will not be the analogue of cards in the USSR.
The Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade of Russia, Viktor Yevtukhov, said that the program of addressing food assistance will not be the analogue of the card system of distribution of food, which existed in the USSR.
It is about modern targeted food assistance to the population and the support of an effective domestic commodity producer.
I'm asking you not to speculate on the word "food card."
I would like to point out in particular that it is not necessary to confuse the proposed product cards with the assessment of the past times of total deficit, the card distribution system, in which the number of products received is normalized.
We have so far proposed the concept, if it is approved, we will propose changes to the legislation," - TASS says Mr. Yevtuhova.
Earlier, "I" wrote that the program for introducing food cards for the poor was introduced to the government.

This year, the study of the Association of Russian Managers "Top-1000 Russian Managers" is published for the 16th time.
As a tool for assessing the professional reputation of Russian senior managers, the study summarizes the results of the work of Russian managers for the year, identifying leaders in industries and functional areas.
The initial pool of candidates is made up of last year’s ranking winners.
Last year’s winners are invited to confirm their participation as the current year’s ranking candidate and to appoint members of their management team.
In addition, each of the candidates included in the initial list are offered to appoint up to ten new managers from other companies, which would be advisable to add to the overall pool of candidates.
It is possible to appoint the following executives of the company's functional areas: financial director, commercial director, marketing director, staff director, IT director, public and corporate relations director, director of relations with the authorities, director of the company.
Each proposed expert manager is invited to participate in the rating and is given the opportunity to present his management team and up to ten new managers from other companies.
The selection of candidates according to the industry principle is carried out on the basis of the industry classifier of the Association of Managers: information technology, commercial banks, forestry and forest processing industry, machinery construction, manufacturing, media business, metallurgy, multi-professional production.
Each participant is provided with a login and a password to log in to www.top1000.amr.ru, where they see information about the other participants and can submit their assessments according to the proposed criteria for each functional direction.
The basis of the methodology of building the rating is the principle "The best choose the best": the top managers evaluate the top managers, the functional managers evaluate the functional managers.
Such a principle allows to obtain the most authentic assessment of the professional reputation of colleagues.
The final results of the rating are approved at the meetings of the expert committees.
All candidates for the current year’s rating and repeated candidates for the past years are invited to attend the meetings of the expert committees.
The commissions are organized on a functional basis: a commission for the approval of the list of senior executives and eight commissions for the approval of executive directors.
At the meetings of the expert committees, it is proposed to approve the submitted lists in alphabetical order (places are kept strictly according to the online assessment and are closed information before the publication of the rating) or to make updates of their adjustments according to the appendix.
The names of the companies are given in accordance with the rules of the Russian language and the norms "<0xD0><0x95>".
At the time of publication of the rating, changes in the status of managers and companies are possible.
The comfortable rate for the loan is 10-13%.
According to experts, the small and medium-sized business lending market rose by 40% in January-April of this year.
What do you think is the situation today?
After the panic at the end of 2014-early 2015, the amount of loans to SMEs decreased significantly.
The reason is clear: a sharp increase in interest rates.
A loan of less than 25-30% a year was not beneficial to anyone.
If the bank had previously been able to put all its possible problems into the higher rate in the future, from delays to non-refunds, then now it is impossible to do so: the rates and so cloudy.
For business, the current level of interest rates on SME loans is uncomfortable.
For a significant part of investment projects, the current level is unacceptable in terms of their recompensability.
A rate of 10-13% would allow businesses to invest in a wide range of projects and create attractive returns on them.
How much do you think the demand for loans for entrepreneurs is satisfied?
After the ECB’s interest rate dropped, the situation improved slightly.
Credit resources have become more accessible.
However, according to our observations, customers began to seek loans much less often.
First of all, the business does not understand the prospects of its development and future income.
Today’s business has one way out: you need to learn to work, focusing on today’s economic situation in the country and the region.
It is necessary to monitor the current results more closely, to monitor the movement of funds.
At the same time, when there are financial resources, it is worth using new technologies to upgrade equipment, reduce production and energy costs.
All of this, in the end, allows the company to make products more competitive and keep the business even in an unstable economic situation.
What major trends in the SME lending market will strengthen and affect its development by the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The forecast for the lowering of the average rate will depend largely on the policy of the Central Bank, and now the regulator is demonstrating consistency in the issue of lowering the key rate.
However, it is not worth waiting for a radical fall in the loan price for SMEs.
In the current situation, the problem is, first of all, inflation, which makes a necessary higher interest rate for real income.
In addition, the value of money in Russia will remain high even when the rates of the central bank are lowered.
If we talk about the level of delay, then traditionally small and medium-sized companies, limited both in the possibilities of replenishing money and in the options of economic behavior correction, will certainly present a greater risk to creditors.
I wouldn’t expect a significant reduction in the share of bad loans.
The main reason is the international sanctions and their negative impact on the country’s economy.
The new Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
This is how Mazda is written in Japanese hieroglyphs.
Beautiful, laconic and at the same time quite difficult for those who are accustomed to Cyrillic or Latin.
The new CX-5 crossover, as well as any other model of the brand, is attractive on the outside, technically perfect on the inside.
Japanese simply because of its "Japanese" is able to bring attachment to the products of the country of the rising sun to a state of complete enthusiasm.
You can argue as much as you like in favor of machines from other countries, and the person will agree even in principle with these arguments, but the whole conversation is distracted from the final phrase: "But it's a Japanese car!
Don't argue about anything!
Such people probably should love not only the technique, but all the other Japanese.
Quoting from the footsteps of Base, spice up the food of Vasabi, collecting katanas and dressing your girlfriend - no, not in kimono, of course, but on the canons of street Japanese fashion: cute, creative and very unexpected.
Perhaps, the Japanese school uniform is the only one that girls wear with pleasure even after they finish school.
It has amazing properties: both sensual and strict at the same time.
And the older the girl, the shorter the skirt.
The main change in the appearance of the CX-5 is the radiator grid with five horizontal lines.
But the new design of the headlights and rear lamps, on which the car is instantly recognized in the flow of cars, changes much more strongly.
As before, the Mazda CX-5 looks very seductive.
The silhouette is harmonious, the shapes are sensual, but the appearance at the same time has the appearance of strictness.
You won't have to call the police.
The CX-5, one of the safest in the world, can only experience the stoic Japanese tranquility.
The 2.2-liter diesel engine provides a high torque in a wide range of speeds.
At the same time, the fuel consumption of this engine with a capacity of 175 hp - only 5.9 l. The power unit is equipped with exclusively automatic transmission and full drive.
Black shoes, black coat, black bag...
To add a bit of black humor to this image, you can choose leggings with print from the police tape Not Cross.
However, Mazda has made every effort to ensure that behind the CX-5 you are not in the spot of your own car.
To further improve comfort while maintaining excellent handling, the suspensions have redesigned the front and rear shock absorbers, as well as optimized the shape of the front lower levers.
The full drive system is adapted to Russian conditions.
The noise level from the road and engine at high speeds has been reduced by 13%.
The bathtub in flowerbeds or stripes is as boring as a budget sedan.
A different case if the girl sneezes in the bathtub with the original drawing.
For example, from a computer game in the genre of a role-playing fighter.
It will not be less noticeable than the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 has an improved design of both front and rear seats, which provides optimum storage space for both wide shoulders and long legs - who owns what.
Still long legs will surely appreciate the fact that the pores in the front of the central tunnel are now soft and do not hit the ankles in the expressions.
The widest range of Mazda active safety systems is offered on the CX-5.
To identify a potential threat, radars, lasers and cameras are used.
There's also adaptive lighting, and a warning of falling out of the lane, and monitoring of dead zones, and safe braking.
The Mazda CX-5 is one of the best luggage carriers in its class.
Convenient, with a minimum of performance, it accommodates a load of 561 litres. The rear seats are folded in a 4:2:4 ratio - with each section equipped with a separate lift lever - and increase the luggage compartment to 1560 litres.
The costume of the character of the cartoon in Japan is called "kigurumi".
Particularly nude looks kigurumi pyjamas.
You can do anything in it!
Of course to sleep.
But also to entertain the little children.
Or just walk around with such a beast on the street...
After all, it’s so great when there’s an opportunity to choose – a casual clothes, a manner of behavior or a car.
Thank you for your help in the preparation of the material store Kawaicat.
Kiev has broken down the atomic union.
Kyiv officially formalized Ukraine’s refusal to cooperate with Russia on the construction of the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant.
The Verkhovna Rada on Wednesday with the second attempt nevertheless voted in favor of the cancellation of the agreement with Moscow.
The agreements for the construction of the third and fourth blocks were signed in 2010-2012, but the project was never implemented.
On Wednesday, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted a law dismantling the agreement concluded in 2010-2012 with the Russian Federation on the construction of the third and fourth blocks of the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant.
The bill passed by the government of the country was only successful since the second vote, for the first time it was supported by 210 MPs with a minimum required of 226, but then 234 MPs voted in favor.
The Khmelnitskaya nuclear power plant installed by the USSR on the original project was to have four 1-GWh power units with reactors of the type VVER, but only managed to build two.
Negotiations with Moscow on reconstruction led to the conclusion of an intergovernmental agreement in 2010, in 2011-2012 the Council adopted the relevant laws.
Since there were no funds in the budget of Ukraine, it was assumed that the construction of blocks would have to be credited to the Russian side, but the funds were not allocated.
After the coup in Kiev in February 2014 and the subsequent cooling in the relations of the two countries, Kyiv began to wreak havoc with Moscow in the nuclear industry, announcing the refusal to cooperate on the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant and on the construction project in the Ukraine.
The only area where the relationship has been maintained is the procurement of fuel in the Russian Federation for the current Ukrainian nuclear power plants (provided about half of the electricity production in the country), as so far the Ukrainian NAEC "Energoatom" replace Russian supplies with nothing.
The plans for the construction of the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant with another contractor in Ukraine have not yet been definitively rejected: in 2014, negotiations with the Czech Skoda JS were announced in Kiev.
The UN General Assembly against the use of military force in the settlement of the Syrian conflict.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said during a press conference that the situation in Syria cannot be resolved by military means.
“There is no military solution,” the AP said in response to a question about Syria’s military support from Russia.
Mr Gi Moon also said he would hold a meeting with the foreign ministers of the permanent members of the UN Security Council on the situation in Syria.
I will hold a meeting with the Heads of Foreign Affairs of the permanent members of the UN Council later this month.
“The meeting will be in Syria,” he said.
Earlier today, Deputy Chief of the Russian Air Force, Nikolai Bogdanovsky, said that the General Staff does not exclude the possibility of establishing an air base in Syria in the future.
There are no such plans yet.
"But anything can be," said Mr. Bogdanovsky.
Earlier, the U.S. reported that it did not trust Russian President Vladimir Putin, who said that military assistance to official Damascus is necessary to fight the banned terrorist group “Islamic State” in Russia.

In PA OSCE reports about a possible meeting of parliamentarians of Ukraine and Russia.
The head of the delegation of Ukraine to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly (PA) Arthur Gerasimov reported on the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with Russian parliamentary colleagues to discuss the situation in the south-east of Ukraine.
"What I know: a certain meeting is planned this year, perhaps between Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations," said Gerasimova.
He also called for the implementation of the Minsk agreements and “return to the normal activities of our countries”.
On the question of whether it is possible, in his opinion, at present, the dialogue between Ukraine and Russia at the parliamentary level - in the "Normandy format" or in the format of the contact group on the OSCE platform - Mr Gerasimov noted that the dialogue was carried out, there were Minsk agreements.
At the same time, according to the politicians, all forms of dialogue are supported in Kiev.
Earlier, the representative of Ukraine at the negotiations, the former president of the country Leonid Kuchma said that the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Lugansk republics have not changed their positions in principle yet in trilateral negotiations, but the tonality of the dialogue has become more positive.
My party has passed the mandate.
Yesterday, the electoral commission of Nizhny Novgorod summarized the results of the elections to the city council for the municipal district, allocating 12 deputy mandates, played on party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints of violations during the election were heard from representatives of the KPRF, who accused the election of "covering the falsifications".
The opposition’s comments were not accepted.
At the same time, he refused the party "Communists of Russia" in the organization of a referendum concerning the cancellation of the fees for the roofing of multi-apartment houses.
The municipal election officially presented the results of the elections in the pride of Nizhny Novgorod for the municipal constituency.
In total, 1.03 million people were included in the voting list in Nizhny Novgorod, 746.7 thousand ballots were issued in the district commissions, and 268 thousand voters voted in the election.
More than 11.7 thousand tickets were declared invalid, and 24 were lost.
Yesterday, 12 mandates were allocated to political parties, depending on the votes they received.
According to the lists of "United Russia" six deputy seats in pride are Dmitry Svatkovsky, Dmitry Krasnov, Vasily Shupranov, Elizavete Solonchenko, Vyacheslav Rasteryaev and Igor Nagorny.
The sole mandate of the LDPR was given by party leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
Two KPRF mandates are distributed between Vladimir Bulanov and State Duma deputy Alexander Tarnaev.
The three mandates of "Just Russia" are given to Alexander Razumovsky, Igor Bogdanov and Mikhail Shalugin.
Now, within five days, these candidates will have to determine whether they will work as deputies in the city council: in case of resignation, he moves to the next candidate on the party list.
The chairman of the Gorjibirkoma, Alexander Makeev, informed the members of the commission that he is introducing duties for "referring telegrams to Zhirinovsky and others" on the subject of the waiver of mandates.
When the protocol was approved on the results of the elections, the representatives of the KPRF declared multiple violations.
The member of the Gorisbirkoma with the right to a council vote from the KPRF Leonid Krasnokutsky proposed not to recognize the results of the vote in four districts No. 21-24, reminding that at the order of the head of the administration of the Sormovsky district was closed the entrance to the building of the administration, where the <0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBE><0xD1><0x80><0xD0><0xB8><0xD0><0xB8><0xD1><0x81><0xD1><0x81><0xD1><0x81><0xD1><0x81><0xD1><0x82><0xD0><0xBC><0xD0><0xB8><0xD1><0x82><0xD0><0xB8><0xD1><0x8F> were located.
For a long time, neither the deputies of the House of Lords, nor the candidates themselves, nor the observers, could pass in, and the resonant scandal with the raiding of the gates of the administration was shown on television.
All observers and members of the committees with the right to vote had the opportunity to attend the meetings of the district commissions.
The head only discontinued access to them when the vote was over and the district commissions had not yet come to hand over their bulletins.
This was done in order to prevent various provocations.
"Then the chapter was corrected, and at all meetings interested persons could be present," - said the member of the mountain constituency Natalia Andryushina.
The Communists objected that in the blocked building of the administration was illegally detained by the deputy for more than four hours at Ludmila Aristov's district assembly, on which a statement was sent to the investigative committee.
The opposition was also outraged that a number of UICs on the day of the election began stamping urns at 6-7 a.m., putting in them ballot papers for early voting.
At the same time, the members of the committees with the right to a meeting vote and the observers were notified, so they arrived at the beginning of the election at 8 a.m.
The communists are confident that in the morning hours before the opening of the polling stations in the urns could uncontrollably throw in the bulletins.
However, the mountain election, which has already considered more than 124 complaints for various reasons, according to Alexander Makeev, did not find any violations with the inputs of unconsidered newsletters.
The members of the commission and their colleague from "Just Russia" Maria Popova did not support the proposal to come out with amendments to regional legislation in order to clearly set the time of opening of envelopes with early voting bulletins, which then fall into the urn.
"In order of your own initiative, contact at least the CIC," - advised Mrs. Popova Alexander Makeev.
At the end of the meeting on the chairman with loud accusations, member of the CPRF Sergei Samohin was shocked, shouting that the election ignored dozens of complaints and covered falsifications in the elections.
"You're not here at the rally, so be careful!" the president of the election was offended.
As a result, the protocol was adopted almost unanimously.
By September 27, the election must confirm the overall results of the election, after which the first meeting of the city council of Nizhny Novgorod of the sixth convocation will be appointed within three weeks.
In addition to defining the results of the elections, the municipal electoral commission refused the political party "Communists of Russia" to register an initiative group to hold a local referendum.
According to the documents, the parties were going to raise two questions for the discussion of the lower city: do they agree that the fees for the roofing of multi-family houses should be "immediately cancelled" and the tariffs on housing and utilities "freeze until 2020".
However, Duma lawyer Irina Maslova explained that the treatment of “Russian Communists” is contrary to the legislation.
FedEx revenues are mixed, the forecasts for 2016 are down.
FedEx reported unpleasant results in the last quarter, and the delivery service giant has reduced the annual profit forecast due to a decline in demand for freight services and an increase in costs in its ground transportation division.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At the same time last year, FedEx reported that it would hire 50,000 temporary workers for the holidays.
Its shares fell by about 2.5 percent on preliminary trades 45 minutes before the opening of the exchange on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it plans to earn from <0x24>10.40 to <0x24>10.90 in the fiscal year that ends next May, which is 20 cents less than the previous forecast.
Analysts estimated <0x24>10.84 according to a FactSet review.
The forecast is down despite an average rate increase of 4.9 percent, which will come into effect on January 4, and an increase in fees for land heavy or bulk cargoes that starts in November.
The company said it is still planning revenue growth compared to last year due to cost reductions, gross revenue increases and growth in online commerce.
President and CEO Fred Smith said the company "has worked steadily in terms of weak economic conditions, as compared to forecasts, especially in manufacturing and global trade."
Workforce hiring plans for the holidays were announced the next day after a competitor, UPS, announced that they plan to hire an additional 95,000 employees, roughly as much as they hired last year.
For the quarter ending August 31, FedEx earned <0x24>692 million, 6 percent more than the year before.
The share income was <0x24>2.42, close to the forecast, an average of <0x24>2.44 per share, conducted by Zacks Investment Research survey of 12 analysts.
Revenue increased by 5%, to <0x24>12.3 billion.
Six analysts interviewed by Zacks estimated <0x24>12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from a decline in the urgent international transport sector, which has resulted in a lack of gross revenue growth in its express transportation division.
However, the boom of online purchases has dramatically improved the results in FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, revenues from land transport increased by 29 per cent, but operating revenues remained unchanged as a whole due to increased costs for large shipments and self-insurance.
The express freight division received higher income due to higher base rates, while in the freight sector income fell due to increased labor costs.
In preliminary trades about an hour before the opening of the FedEx stock exchange fell by <0x24>3.85 or 2.5 percent - up to <0x24>150.15.
They closed on Tuesday, falling 11 percent per year and 17 percent below the 11 June record.
At the most anticipated meeting in a few years, the leaders of the Federal Reserve will spend two days this week at a 27-foot table made of Honduran redwood, deciding whether it’s time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in almost ten years.
At one end of a richly decorated meeting room with a height of two floors above them will be engraved a wall image of the United States.
This card is a reminder that the President of the Federal Reserve, Janet L. Ellen, and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the country above all others.
The central bank received a double mandate from Congress: to maximize employment in the United States and to keep stable prices here.
But since the Great Recession, the leaders of the Federal System have acknowledged that there is a third, unwritten mandate: financial stability.
And this third order could be an unknown factor in a nearly forecast decision, which will be announced Thursday, whether the U.S. economy is ready to break away from the unprecedented stimulus provided by the near-zero short-term interest rate of 2008.
Even though most of the data shows a confident growth in the economy, recent turmoil in the global financial markets can keep the Federal system’s already cautious leaders from adding volatility by raising the base rate on federal funds.
“Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the first and most important subject of consideration,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“However, I think that if they were looking for a reason not to raise the stakes, the increased uncertainty around the world market would be enough to give them the excuse to wait further,” she noted.
There is no consensus on what they will do in the Federal Reserve system, which in itself provokes fluctuations in the financial market.
Approximately half of economists surveyed recently by Bloomberg predicted interest rate growth this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the Federal System to refrain from doing so, with the key indicator showing only about 30 percent likelihood of a rapid rise.
This could lead to a fall in the stock market if the Federal System raises the rate, provided that those who make decisions will not soften the blow by promising that the next raise will be soon.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones index rose 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The trip was sparked by expectations that those defining the federal system’s strategy would leave the bet this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody’s Capital Markets Research.
“It would be a surprise if the Federal system raises rates at this point in time,” he said.
If the Federal Reserve’s leadership does so, “they will have to go a long way in affirming their strategy to keep the financial markets in their hands so they don’t panic.”
Other experts objected that an increase in the rate could calm the financial markets, as this would remove uncertainty as to how the Federal system would operate.
Just a month ago, the federal system seems to be inclined to raise the rate by 0.25% this month, making the first small step in slowing down financial conditions, which could confirm the strength of the U.S. recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that she expects higher rates this year, despite complaints from liberals about the need for greater economic progress.
Although the emergence of new jobs slowed in August, the growth of the labour market was stable this year.
Unemployment fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest rate in more than seven years, and almost at the level that the Federal system considers full employment.
The rise in wages shows signs of acceleration.
And while inflation continues to be below the 2% annual rate set by the central bank, the federal system’s management said the key cause was the temporary effect of a sharp drop in oil prices.
“The economy can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the decline in the labour market,” said Ian Shefferdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world became tense at the end of last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow-Jones average for industrial companies’ stocks fell by as much as 16% of a record high in May, as investors feared a slowdown in China’s economy could slow global growth.
The market partially restored its position this month, and the Dow Jones index is now about 10% below its May high value.
For the management of the Federal Reserve system, market outrage further complicates difficult calculations of the term of interest rate increase.
“With no information on what happened in the financial markets and news of the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, they would start to turn the beams at this meeting,” said Steven D. Oliner, senior system researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and formerly a Feader.
Now, according to his forecasts, they will wait at least a month to get more control over the consequences.
"There is great uncertainty as to what the consequences may be for the U.S. economy, and they have almost no credible data after the recent events in China," Oliner said.
The health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the Federal system, and it should not be technically taken into account when making these decisions.
But essentially, the Federal Reserve system has become a world financial power.
The influence of the Central Bank in recent years has been enormous.
Only one hint from then-President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Federal Reserve system could “silence” its monetary expansion has sparked shocks in markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economic systems are increasingly intertwined, it could be expected that the Federal Reserve will not only monitor developments everywhere, but also consult with representatives of other central banks and experts to better understand the world.
Their decision-making process is “art faster than science,” said Zakari Karabell, head of Envestnet Inc., a company that deals with global asset management strategies.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, noted this month that "in the history of the Federal Reserve there have been cases of excessive reaction to financial market movements that do not seem to be related to economic principles."
Lacker, a member with the right to vote of the influential Federal Open Market Committee, who insisted on raising the rate, as an example of the 1998-99 decision.
The financial crisis in Asia has led the federal system to lower its base rate by 0.75% in three meetings, "despite the limited identifiable consequences for growth in the United States," Lacker said.
A year later, the Federal system’s leaders cancelled these reductions.
The Federal Reserve system should be put at the forefront of stability only in times of major crises, such as the collapse of the market in 2008,” said Adam S. Pozen, a former member of the Bank of England interest rate committee.
The last panic and not close to that level, he said.
“You wouldn’t want to be in a situation where you’re afraid of rising rates because markets are shocked,” said Pozen, president of the Peterson Institute of World Economy.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that changes, I do not think they should be ahead of events.

State Duma spokesman Sergei Naryshkin admits that the U.S. is intentionally destabilizing the situation in the Middle East so that the waves of refugees slip into Europe.
According to Interfax, he expressed this opinion to journalists in Ulan-Bator during the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
"I am not a proponent of conspiracy theories, but the question is: is not Europe the ultimate goal of those who have destabilized the situation in the countries of North Africa and the Middle East with such maniac persistence in recent years?" he asked.
"I'm sure someone assumed and knew that the flows of refugees, these unhappy and helpless people who are saved from death, are aiming for prosperous EU countries," he added.
Naryshkin asked, “Have many political leaders in Europe made a frank statement about the causes of this crisis, this wave of refugees, which is now literally freezing their countries?”
“No, old Europe, with rare exceptions, prefers to be silent,” he said.
According to Naryshkin, NATO violates many European values and norms of international law.
“Unfortunately, Europe has long and impartially looked at and looked at how the military boot, sewn by NATO standards, disintegrates both moral ideals and fundamental principles and norms of international law,” the spokesman said.
The rebels, consisting mainly of Islamists, are opposed to government troops and loyal militia formations.
Later, the Syrian government’s opponents joined the terrorist group “Islamic State” which was banned in Russia.
The United States supports rebels who oppose both Assad and ISIS.
Official Damascus considers such rebels to be terrorists.
The President of Syria called the cause of the dislike of the West to Russia.
The West’s claims to countries like Syria, Russia and Iran are in fact that they are sovereign states.
Such an opinion was expressed by Syrian President Bashar Assad in an interview with RT, the First Channel, "Russia 24", NTV, "Russia Today", TASS, "Interfax" and "Russian Newspaper".
According to Assad, the West does not perceive partners and sovereign states.
In these countries, he would like to remove one person and put another in his place, which will act in the interests of the Western countries, not in the interests of his homeland.
Assad drew attention to the sharp turn of the Western media with the start of the coup in Ukraine.
According to him, Russian President Vladimir Putin “has turned from a friend of the West into an enemy, a tsar, a dictator who suppresses the Russian opposition, who came to power in a non-democratic way, despite being elected as a result of democratic elections recognized by Zara.”
Putin called on the world community to join forces with Assad to fight the “Islamic State.”
Commenting on the constant statements of the West that Assad himself should leave, he noted that the president comes to power with the consent of the people, through elections, and if he leaves - at the request of the people, not by the decision of the United States, the UN Security Council, the Geneva Conference or the Geneva Commune.
“If the people want him to stay, the president will stay, and otherwise he should leave immediately,” he said.
Assad called Russia and Iran friendly countries and reminded them that cooperation is being carried out with them.
Syria is also fighting terrorism in conjunction with neighbouring Iraq.
Speaking of Iran’s military support, the Syrian leader noted that the country supports the Syrian state in politics, in the economy and in the military sphere.
He denied allegations that Iranian military units were being sent to Syria.
Tehran supplies us with military equipment.
“Of course, there is an exchange of military experts between Syria and Iran, but this exchange has always taken place,” he said.
As for the other States, we are open to cooperation with any of them if there is a serious desire to fight terrorism.
“We do not see this in the case of the so-called anti-terrorist and anti-igilov coalition, led by the United States,” Assad said.
The death toll exceeded 230,000, and the number of refugees was 11.5 million.
Part of the territory was seized by the terrorist group “Islamic State”, banned in Russia.
The international coalition led by the United States is carrying out air strikes on the positions of ISIS.
In Utah, 12 people were killed by the flood.
In the U.S. state of Utah, at least 12 people died as a result of the flooding.
Another one is considered missing without news, reports Fox 13 Salt Lake City.

Lavrov and Kerry discuss the situation in Syria: Politics: Peace: Lenta.ru
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry had a telephone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.
This is reported by Reuters with reference to State Department spokesman John Kirby.
It is noted that the topic of the talks was the conflict in Syria.
However, Kirby did not provide any further details.
At the same time, he said the U.S. has tools for “further isolation of Russia” if it will support Syrian President Bashar Assad, RIA Novosti reports.
According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, Lavrov in talks with Kerry once again stressed the need to establish a united front to combat the terrorist groups operating in the territory of the country.
We also discussed ways to resolve the Ukrainian crisis, possible steps to reduce tensions on the Korean Peninsula.
In addition, a number of bilateral issues have been addressed.
Earlier, U.S. officials said that Russia is increasing its military presence in Syria, and expressed concern about the strengthening of Moscow’s support for Assad.
In Washington, it was said that if Russia continues to support Assad, it would be even more isolated from the international community.
In response, Russian President Dmitry Peskov said that the country will not fall into international isolation.
The insurgents are in favor of the overthrow of the Assad regime.
Part of the territory was seized by the terrorist organization “Islamic State”.
The international coalition led by the United States is subject to ISIS positions from the air.
Borodai called the information of the American newspaper a slander on Strelkov.
Former Prime Minister of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic Alexander Borodai denied the information, which was published in the American newspaper The Washington Post.
He said this in a telephone interview with the Lenty.ru correspondent.
The note in the Washington Post is beautiful because everything is cleanly distorted there.
The former Defense Minister of the DPR Igor Strelkov, of course, no one connected and he "exited" from the territory of the republics of Donbass in a very elevated mood, without ropes, without three furs of money, which are attributed to him by different characters.
According to Borodia, the talk about Sagittarius in a conversation with a reporter of the American newspaper was indeed about.
“Yes, I said that Strelkov was urgently required to be removed from the territory of the Donetsk People’s Republic,” the former head of the DPR government said.
Borodai stressed that he does not know why the correspondent of the American edition decided to write that Strelkov was taken out to the territory of Russia "connected".
I suspect it's a provocation.
If it’s not a provocation, it’s surprisingly misunderstood words, as I stressed that Strelkov left alone,” said Borodai.
"It's a curse for me and for Sterkov," he concluded.
Earlier, an article appeared on The Washington Post, which stated Borody’s words that he had forced Sagittarius into the territory of Russia.
According to the publication, Borodai noted that he was forced to tie his partner.
Polish authorities have begun to search for a train with Nazi gold.
Polish woodcutters began to cut trees above the underground tunnel, where, according to some data, there is a train with the gold of the Third Reich.
Work began on Tuesday, September 15, according to Reuters.
According to military experts, clearing the forest is necessary in order to verify the credibility of rumors about the railway composition with the treasures.
Inside the train can be weapons and valuable minerals.
On August 31, the governor of the Lower Nizhny Novgorod Voivodeship, Tomasz Smolarz, assumed that the new evidence of the existence of a train with gold was no more convincing than the previous ones.
However, the authorities decided to seize the search area.
Three days before this, the Deputy Minister of Culture of Poland, Petr Zhukhovsky, said that local depositors with a "99 percent probability" found the same train with the Third Reich gold, which is mentioned in legends.
Zhukhovsky noted that if the assumptions are confirmed and the jewels are discovered, they will become the property of the state execution, while the treasures will not be handed over to Russia.
In mid-August, two clients of the law firm contacted the authorities of the Polish city of Valb<0xC5><0xBE>ih with a message that they found a train in a tunnel that was blocked at a depth of 70 meters.
The chief narcologist of the Russian Federation has proposed to ban the sale of tobacco to persons under 21 years of age.
Russia’s chief narcologist has proposed banning the sale of tobacco until the age of 21.
Evgeny Bryun noted that before this age, "any psychoactive substance - tobacco, alcohol, drugs - acts particularly detrimentally."
So he said on a live broadcast of the radio station "Moscow Speaks", commenting on the information that Suffraged speaker Valentina Matvienko supported the idea of a ban on the sale of alcohol to citizens under 21.
The person matures unevenly.
You can serve in the army from the age of 18, a person is physically ready for it.
He is mentally ready for a full-fledged life in society from the age of 21.
“It is known from scientific data that the brain, its biochemistry, finally matures only by the age of 21,” Bryun said.
Earlier, a member of the House of Commons and head of the project "Treaszaya Russia" Sultan Hamzaev told "Izvestia" that Matvienko supported the initiative to increase the age-censorship in the sale of alcohol and "agreed that the House of Commons jointly raises the issue again".
According to the activist, in the Council of the Federation will soon be set up a working group to develop the bill under the direction of Matvienko.
The Bible was asked to check for compliance with the Children's Information Protection Act
The resident of Novosibirsk appealed to the regional prosecutor’s office to verify the Bible for compliance with the federal law “On the protection of children from information causing harm to their health and development”, with a statement on 16 September reported to the correspondent Sib.fm.
The author of the petition stated that on August 26, 2015, he purchased a Bible in the store "Chitai City" on Red Avenue, published in 2013 by the Russian Bible Society.
In the text of the book, he discovered fragments that, in his view, violate the FZ "On protecting children from information that is harmful to their health and development".
On 16 September, the statement was accepted for consideration by the Novosibirsk City Prosecutor’s Office.
The response to the appeal of the resident of Novosibirsk will be received within 30 days.
The point is not to ban a book.
It is much more interesting to show the absurdity of the law itself, - commented the applicant to the correspondent Sib.fm.
Moreover, it is a very fundamental problem that will accelerate society.
He will begin to read the Bible, which he has not done before.
Brazilian Federation of Pediatricians Rio Grande Promotes Healthy Breeding Nutrition
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS has invented a scandalous method to convince women of the need for full-fledged nutrition during breastfeeding: the method involves demonstrating images of breast-feeding infants depicted in the pictures below.
Breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, from which children receive all the nutrients they need to form a strong immune system.
Due to high energy needs, pregnant and pregnant women are advised to increase the daily calorie rate by about 500 calories per day.
However, a recent study shows that one calorie increase is not the only change in the diet that mothers should make.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, a professor at Ballor Medical College in Texas, found that a healthy diet for pregnant women actually affects the expression of genes in children and prevents the development of tumors in them.
Unfortunately, the negative effects of unhealthy nutrition on the child’s immune system have been identified.
Under Hamburg, a train crashed into a school bus.
Near Hamburg, a train crashed into a school bus that was stuck on a railroad.
The 23-year-old driver, realizing that she could not move from the rails, ordered 60 students to leave the vehicle.
And a minute later, they had a collision in their eyes.
He was shot by one of the schoolchildren.
Because of the emergency situation, there was panic among the students.
Some children began to cry and run along the perimeter.
The route is still blocked.
According to police, no one was miraculously injured except one passenger of the train, who suffered minor injuries.
The damage from the accident was estimated at <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300,000.
Doctors are calling for a ban on boxing.
The Australian Medical Association (AMA) has called for a ban on boxing in the country after the death of local athlete David Brown Jr..
On Monday, 28-year-old Brown died from injuries sustained in a fight with Filipino Carlo Magali.
The fight for one of the regional titles according to the International Boxing Federation (IBF) in the weight category up to 57.15 kg, which took place on Friday, ended with Magali’s victory with a knockout in the 12th round.
Brown went to the hospital with a skull injury.
His condition was assessed as critical, and he was connected to the life-saving apparatus.
In the professional ring, Brown won 22 wins, suffered only two losses, and one battle ended in defeat.
He has two children left.
This is the second death toll among Australian boxers in the last six months.
In March, 23-year-old student Braddon Smith died from injuries in the ring.
Now AMA recommends not doing this sport, but rather, from her point of view, ban it at all.
“I understand that this is happening unintentionally,” said Steven Parnes, vice president of the organization.
But in the form in which boxing now exists, there will always be situations where an athlete gets a bleeding or brain injury, which leads to either death, or to severe damage.
For this reason, AMA believes that we cannot continue to live with it.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional organization that brings together practitioners and medical students. . . .
Sergei Naryshkin called on the OSCE to lift sanctions against Russian parliamentarians.
Russian State Duma spokesman Sergei Naryshkin called the introduction of sanctions against parliamentarians unacceptable.
He said this at the OSCE PA session in Ulan-Bator.
We regard this as unacceptable actions, as an insult to the values of parliamentary diplomacy.
“And this should not be repeated, because it is a manifestation of political shame and ignoring the principles of open international dialogue,” he said.
In addition, Naryshkin called on the OSCE PA participants to restore the partnership between Russia and the EU.
Let's turn morality into politics.
Let us restore dialogue and the right to practice international communication.
Let’s bring humanistic ideals back to the democratic world order.
“The duality never ends with a good thing,” he said.
Speaking from the stands of the Parliamentary Assembly, the speaker of the Russian State Duma called on parliamentarians to convene an inter-parliamentary contact group on Ukraine.
I call on the members of the Assembly to focus on the following specific security tasks.
“First of all, on the resolution of the Ukrainian crisis through negotiations and the immediate convocation of our inter-parliamentary group,” Naryshkin said.
He also noted that the OSCE should be honoured.
“This is almost the only common site where we are still discussing how to normalize the situation in Ukraine,” he said.
The autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly was opened on Tuesday, September 15, in Ulan-Bator and will last until September 18.
I enjoyed the victory for a couple of days.
World Champion of Athletics Sergei Shubenkov.
This season can be called a triumph for 24-year-old lightweight athlete from Barnaul Sergey Shubenkova.
He managed at his crown distance of 110 metres with barriers to win the European team championship, set several records, and most importantly - to become the world champion, the first in the history of the domestic barrier sprint.
In addition, the athlete recently won the final stage of the "Brilliant League", occupying third place overall.
"New News" asked Shubenkov to share impressions from the outgoing season.
Sergey, is the season not over yet?
Yes, I’m going to perform at the World War Games, which will take place in October in Korea, and then I’ll think about the rest.
True, I'll be at home now, in Barnaul, and being at home is a completely different condition.
It’s easier than walking around the world every week.
You said that autumn is your favorite time of year.
The end of August, the beginning of September is a wonderful time.
Passions after the main start of the season have been repaid, the burden of responsibility no longer pushes.
You can enjoy it in the "relaxation".
Plus, you know that the holidays will soon...
Is there fatigue?
The season is special, a lot of positive emotions...
Fatigue at the end of the season accumulates.
It doesn’t matter what he did, whether he won or lost.
Every competition is a stressful one.
Permanent flights, relocations - all this does not go unnoticed for the body.
You get tired physically and emotionally.
But now my emotions are on the rise, of course.
I mean, I'm just happy!
By the time you finish at the World Cup in Beijing, do you come back often?
Yes, it does.
And you, journalists, don't let me forget that.
But in general, I believe that the bad athlete who lives with old victories is rolling his successful runs over and over again.
I enjoyed the victory for a couple of days - and I have to move on.
Is the preparation for this wonderful season very different from the usual?
I can't say there was something so special.
We started preparing in December, but I missed the winter competition season.
He trained first at home in Barnaul, then at the meetings, then again at home.
It's all as usual.
But with the coach, the task was to try to get to a new level that I haven’t been to yet.
Almost all the winter time was spent laying the foundation.
We ran a lot of crosses, did general physical training exercises, which included both pull, and seat, and we ran the back.
Then they took on barrier training, a lot of techniques.
How are the competitors being monitored?
I always try to do this, good in the age of the Internet there is no problem with it.
He watched the winter championship of Europe, and there in the barrier sprint the whole pedestal was occupied by the French!
I also thought: something needs to be done, to dilute this company.
With each start of this season you added and added in the results.
Did that give you confidence?
All of my last seasons are about the same.
There's no way I'm running 13.20 first, and then 13.50.
I'm always rolling my form gradually.
The main thing I wanted to do was run out of 13 seconds.
All the work was primarily aimed at this result.
But the paradox is that you feel like you’re ready for a breakthrough, and in competitions you don’t always show your readiness.
What was it like at the Olympics in London?
I, to be honest, that semi-final run (Shubenkov could not go to the final. - "NI") tried to forget right away.
It was really good, I could have run out of 13 seconds.
Even if he had repeated his best result at the time, he would have been a bronze medalist at the Games.
But I'm not lucky.
Do you remember your first World Cup?
How about that?
That was in Tag.
I really wanted to go to the finals, there was such a program-maximum.
And it fell straight from the morning, in the early runs.
Then I realized that to break and wear a broken head means not to go anywhere at all.
Two years later, at the World Championships in Moscow, he was already in the final with the best time.
I remember well my feelings before the decisive run: I really wanted to win "gold" already then!
How do you manage to develop decent speed, not to lose even your head, not to turn off?
That's the hardest thing.
You need to be very careful, focused on the technique so as not to break down barriers.
I noticed that when you adjust not to the result, but to the process, it is so much easier.
And the worst part is when you have the feeling that you are running and everything is as if you are doing it yourself!
Honestly, it's worth it.
Many of our athletes from the depths after the first serious successes seek to move closer to the capital.
Have you ever had such thoughts?
It's still better at home.
I can't imagine where I'm without my coach, who needs me?
Maybe, and it would be good to have better conditions, but I try to be happy with what I have.
Have you been with Klevtsy for a long time?
Since he was 12 years old, he has been in athletics.
Actually, at first I trained with his wife, who worked with children, and then she already handed me over.
I started with a sprint, then jumped in length, triple.
Children's multiplayer was - it's when they hit the ball, jump in length from place...
At 14, I tried running with barriers, and I liked it.
From the first run it was possible to comply with the norms of the second adult class.
That's the way it is.
Have you ever been afraid of barriers?
I managed to get a deal with them right away.
But the technology has always had to work a lot.
How much pain he has suffered over one of them!
But this routine is nowhere to go.
The technique needs to be refurbished all the time - so that at night I could wake up, I would get up right away and run through the barriers.
Everyone who has seen your run in Beijing claims that it was a very beautiful run.
Oh, thank you.
I liked it too.
I usually don't review my runs, and I couldn't stand it.
But we need to work on efficiency – there are no limits to perfection.
Don’t you fear that a victory in the year before the Olympics will be on your shoulders with a heavy load?
As they say in such cases, I will try to justify expectations.
Once you have chosen this path, you have to go to the end.
My coach likes to repeat: if you are not weak, no extra load should be felt.
And I totally agree with him on that.
Otar Kushansville
Well, I'm not so naive that I'm surprised by the reaction to the interview that happened in Ukraine.
People are angry, I understand, don't feed them with bread - give, throw the enemy.
And although I didn't fly the flag, and the same thing, I spoke a million times here, and I didn't call anyone a bitch directly, I did something else.
All my pseudo-friends fled, evaporated somewhere in a second.
The pressure that I am subjected to is so strong that even I, who issuing the types of boys, think that people are underwear.
It's like he's gone, he's gone, and you've been attacked by a crowd, and now he's mutated with sticks.
But you must know me, I'm not a room eagle, I'm a punch, I'm a cuckold, I'm old, guys, I'm scared.
The other thing is no support.
I had no illusions, and now...
The best thing in me has always been self-sufficiency, so eat.
And to give passports to orphans like Fred Derst or Monson, only fools can.
I'd rather be a good journalist than a good journalist.
A week ago in Kiev, Otar Kushanashvili sharply described the Crimean events:
What they did to the Crimean Peninsula is a crime.
This is what is called annexation.
I so believe that the reference to how Khrushchev tried to sign something does not at all fit into the overall picture of the human dormitory.
This is how to get to a neighbor and pick up his living space...
The war in the Kremlin is over, and it will only end there.
I’m almost 100% sure that, like in the summer of 2008, she started with a call from some piece of crap from the Kremlin’s fence.
I'm guessing who that might have been...
Cobzone is not so much left to live.
I don’t understand why he’s the greatest artist, why he needs to lick Putin’s hands.
Is he going to lose the apartment?
Well, bring him a monument.
Of course, people remember him as insulting his little country.
And the reconciliation now depends only on Vladimir Vladimirovich.
Sunrise Seventh leads in the ranking despite Ninth's attempts to illuminate the loss of leaders in Today Show
Karl Stefanovich and Lisa Wilkinson’s departure to Canberra to highlight the consequences of the Liberal Party’s claim to liberate the leader’s seat was not able to raise the Today rating.
The morning show of the Nine was broadcast from the state capital after the crash by Malcolm Turnbull Tony Abbott.
Competitor Sunrise, with leading David Koh and Samantha Armitage, is stuck in London as part of a weekly international broadcasting series that also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This distance torture seems to be of little importance to Australian viewers, with Sunrise having 397,000 viewers in the five largest cities compared to Today’s 339,000 viewers.
Today gained a little more than its rating on Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its figure was worse than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has reduced the gap with Sunrise in recent months.
Today had 318,000 in August compared to 330,000 at Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap varied between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has 349,000 spectators versus 314,000 at Today.
It was the most interesting thing that happened all morning.
Winds of change are affecting more than Parliament this morning, guys!
Carl and Lisa are okay, thanks for the clarification!

An important news for Seven was the amazing debut of 800 Words with former series star Packed to the Rafters by Eric Thomson.
A new drama about the recently widowed father of the family, who decides to move to New Zealand on the coast with his two children, gathered an impressive audience of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics have argued whether Thompson can cope with the popular show alone without the Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Yesterday's result was a loud "yes" response.
The X Factor Seven remained strong with an audience of 1,136 million, easily bypassing The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
For Seven, luck and failure were mixed on the second night of Chase Australia.
The first half hour (from 5:00 p.m. to 5:30 p.m.) of the new TV show, led by Andrew O'Keefe, gathered 446,000 spectators.
The second half hour (from 17:30 to 18:00) the number jumped to 623,000 spectators – enough for a small victory over the Hot Seat Eddie McGuire (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of Chase Australia gathered 520,000 spectators, and the second half hour – 720,000.
Hot Seat collected 620,000.
The decline in Chase Australia ratings on the second night will make the Ninth silently admit that Hot Seat will still dominate at 5:30 p.m.
Chase Australia is a replacement for Million Dollar Minute, which was unable to replay the McGuire show.

Three finalists agree that Holocaust Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who will he choose?
The secret is revealed...
Lana Jevon-Flower, Sarah McCain, and Snowman Marcoski may have accidentally made it clear which of them will win the Holocaust.
The woman with whom Sam Wood will eventually stay in Holocaust is surrounded by a veil of secrets.
And the three girls who came to the finals, of course, keep silence about which one of them got his last rose.
But when we met Sarah McCain, Snowy Markoski, and Lana Jevons-Fellows on the eve of the day when two of the three girls were supposed to stay, they may have accidentally given a clue about the winner.
Sam Wood will remain silent until the final, which will take place on Thursday.
All three women come in a lyrical mood, explaining why Wood is an ideal man, while mentioning his sense of humor, determination, family values, and vitality as the reasons why each of them would be happy to be his companion.
However, with their answers to the question "If not you, who should get the last rose of Wood?" they could inadvertently indicate which of them actually won the heart of "Holostyak".
Jevons-Fellows and Marcoski no doubt called McCain the perfect couple for Wood.
Sarah and Sam have had a good relationship since the first day.
“From the moment I joined the show, I felt the energy (Sarah) and the energy of Sam, and I realized they were very close to each other, and throughout the show I had no doubt about it,” said Jevons-Flouz.
“Sara is a very open person, easy and fun with her,” added Markoski.
I've seen them together, there's really an attraction between them.
They feel beautiful and comfortable with each other.
Sarah McCain thinks she and Sam Wood are going to be a great couple.
McCain herself said that thanks to her home dates last week she realized that Wood might be “the same person.”
“As soon as I saw him among my friends and relatives, I realized it wasn’t just a game – I trusted him with all my heart,” she says.
When asked who should choose Wood, if it is not her, she answered mysteriously.
"I don't know if I can talk about it," she said.
I like both girls the same, and Snow and Lana are equally worthy of it.
The Bachelor show will be released on Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. on the Ten Channel.
Originally published under the title "Sara is Sam Wood's Best Choice?"
Jarrid Hayne had several options to start his career in the NFL.
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in him after he moved to the U.S. — like many other clubs who sent requests after an impressive open day of training at the end of last year.
But Hayn chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Thomsul, and it seems to have been a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hayne on the bench for the rest of the game for the loss of the ball, which the former Australian rugby league player allowed on the first return of the panda in a win-win game with Minnesota with a score of 20-3.
But Tomsula believed in his player and gave Heinz another chance to return the pant, as well as involved him in the game after Reggie Bush’s injury.
Tomsula showed himself on the good side and after the game, in the dressing room.
Instead of arranging a distribution for newcomers in the presence of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at a press conference after the match.
Special Reporter of the 49ers club, Cam Inman, said Hayne had also received support from Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGowan, who advised him to forget the lost ball and think about the next game.
Jarred Hayn lost the ball to the Minnesota Walkings team back in the first quarter
At the beginning of his NHL debut, Hayn and his many Australian fans clearly did not expect it.
It was seen as Hayn sneezed out of the field after losing the ball, and later he told the leading show "Hamish and Andy" on Australian radio station 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a more unsuccessful start for an NFL career.
“That’s what happens, you just think about the next game and that’s all,” Hayn said.
Hayn compared his failure to his debut in the 2007 Origin series, when a throw of the ball in his county zone brought Queensland a try.
In the end, this experience proved to be very useful for a 27-year-old player.
Hayn was photographed with the Australian flag and fans after the game and posted a photo on Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested on threat of use of weapons at the Siberian airport.
Openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was condemned, his oil company Yukos was confiscated, and his attempts to develop democracy were suppressed.
At the Hungarian border, there were clashes of migrants with the police.
Refugees have held protests at the Serbian border near the Hungarian settlement of Reska, which have grown into clashes with law enforcement officials.
As a result, Hungarian police used watermelons and tear gas, according to Reuters.
Migrants throw police stones and try to take down the fence on the border.
At the scene of the clashes, reinforcements are being directed, police are taking action in response to the aggressive actions of migrants and their attempts to break the border.
As reported by Agence France-Presse, refugees managed to break through the police border, after which dozens of migrants fled to Hungary.
Some refugees leave the Serbian-Hungarian border by bus to Belgrade and the Croatian border, the BBC reports.
The authorities of the country have allowed migrants to arrive on Croatian territory and ensure their transport from there to the necessary country.
According to the Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers were injured.
On 15 September, the Hungarian Parliament tightened the legislation on migration and border protection.
The amendments include the involvement of the army in the security of the state borders, the criminal prosecution of those who illegally cross the border, as well as the expedited procedure for examining asylum applications.
The Hungarian court has already found one migrant guilty of illegally crossing the Hungarian-Serbian border and will be deported and unable to return to Hungary within one year.
The Hungarian parliament also intends to consider the question of transferring to the armed forces of Hungary the functions of guarding the country’s borders.
At the end of June, the Hungarian authorities began building a 175-kilometre-long wire fence on the Serbian border to deter migrants and refugees from entering the country.
The Russian admitted to committing the largest cyberattack in U.S. history.
The biggest U.S. cyber attacker, Vladimir Drinkman, confessed to stealing more than 160 million credit card numbers, according to Reuters.
During the trial in the New Jersey federal court, Dr. Drinkman admitted in conspiracy to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and commit fraud.
During the meeting, the Russian spoke about the conspiracy with three citizens of Russia and a citizen of Ukraine, who are accused of cyberattacks on 15 companies.
The total damage from the actions of the accused was estimated at <0x24>300 million.
“Attorneys like Vladimir Drinkman, who have the skills to hack our computer networks, pose a threat to our economic well-being, personal life and national security,” U.S. Attorney General Paul Fishman said in a statement.
Drinkman was sentenced to 30 years in prison, as well as a <0x24>1 million fine.
When the sentence is given, the court will take into account the recognition of the Russian and, possibly, will shorten his term.
Drinkman's sentence will be announced on January 15.
Vladimir Drinkman was arrested in the Netherlands in 2012.
At the same time, another suspect, Dmitry Smiljanets, was taken into custody.
The latter denies his guilt in the crimes incriminating him.
Kerry warned Lavrov about the risk with Russia’s support of the Bashar al-Assad regime.
During a telephone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry warned that Russia’s support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is exacerbating the conflict in the country.
“Secretary Kerry made it clear that Russia’s support for President Assad risks exacerbating and expanding the conflict, as well as undermining our common goal of combating extremism if we don’t focus on the site of Goa’s political leadership in Syria,” he said.
Kerry reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to combat the Islamic State group (the activities of which are prohibited in Russia by the Supreme Court) in a coalition of more than 60 states.
According to the secretary of state, Assad "can never be a reliable member" of the coalition.
Also during a telephone conversation, Kerry stressed that the conflict in Syria can only be resolved through a political transition from Assad.
In the White House, Russia was threatened with isolation because of the support of the Assad regime.
Earlier in the day, White House press secretary Joshua Ernest threatened Russia with isolation if it did not stop supporting Assad.
As an alternative, Ernest proposed to join the international coalition, which is conducting an anti-terrorist operation against the Islamic State.
Recently, the media has often reported the presence of Russian military personnel in the territory of Syria.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Russian soldiers have been in Syria for many years and are helping Syrians to master the technique to use it against Islamists.
Four people were killed when police opened fire with rubber bullets on protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal when police began shooting with rubber bullets in a crowd protesting the country’s proposed new constitution, a spokesman said on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday evening in Rupandei district, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the country’s capital.
Bishnu Prasad Dakal, the head of the district police, said more than 1,000 protesters gathered at one of the police offices, some throwing stones and firebombs.
Mr. Dakal reported that the police used tear gas, then shot in the air before putting rubber bullets into circulation.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It is unclear why rubber bullets, which are known to be killable, but traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, have caused such a high mortality rate.
This clash was the last few weeks of fierce protests in the southern plain of Nepal, where representatives of the Madesi people say the new provinces formed under the new constitution will reduce their political influence.
Protests also took place in western Nepal, among citizens of the Taru people who want to have their own state.
At least 40 people, including eleven police officers, have been killed in violent clashes, starting with 10
In August, when four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces, it became a decisive step on the path to a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for several centuries.
Work on the new constitution has been underway since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Legislators voted in favour of the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials said the new chapter would be signed by Sunday.
Saiansk plans to create an enterprise with 900 jobs.
Saiansk is the youngest city in the Irkutsk region.
Built in the 1970s as a center of the chemical industry, it has developed infrastructure requiring system support.
A year ago, Saiansk was headed by a new mayor - Oleg Borovsky.
About the results of the first year of work, about new projects and prospects he told the correspondent "Oblastna".
Oleg Valerievich, where did you start working as mayor?
First of all, I was familiar with the results of the financial and economic audits, initiated an independent audit of expenditures of local budget funds.
The municipal property was subsequently audited.
One of the first practical steps was to reduce the circulation of documents to five days.
Previously, papers on instances could go for months.
Activities have been developed to increase the income base and optimize costs.
In November last year, the government's exit meeting was held in Sayansk, where issues of the socio-economic development of the territory were discussed.
In the city there was no project estimate documentation (PSD) for any object.
Without this, Saiyansk could not participate in federal programs.
We started with the preparation of PSDs for roads, kindergarten, northern sewer collector and water supply.
The roadworks are already underway in two areas.
How in the city is the decree of the President of the Russian Federation on the construction of kindergartens implemented?
In July of this year, 105 babies were born in Saiyansk.
Such a positive demographic has not been observed in the city in the last 27 years.
So the issue of the provision of places in kindergartens is one of the most relevant today.
Since 1 September closed for the capital repair of the kindergarten No. 10, which is estimated at 320 seats.
The estimated cost of repair is 86 million rubles.
The city has never received such funds before.
Last year after the repairs opened kindergarten No. 23, which now visits 200 children.
The repair was done under the conditions of co-financing from regional and local budgets, its cost was more than 67 million rubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the administration and the assistance of the regional government, funds have been sought for the purchase of furniture and equipment, and the program "People's Initiatives" has also helped.
There are plans to start construction of a new kindergarten in 2016.
With its introduction, we plan to eliminate the sequelae of children aged between three and a half years.
We have no orders for children between the ages of three and seven.
Are Investors Interested in the Territory?
We have a clear understanding that construction in the city should be carried out, first of all, by Saiyan enterprises, they should be provided with work.
Already in October, a 60-apartment house for orphaned children in the Leningradskyi microregion will be put into operation.
As for the construction, I would add that Sayansk is one of four cities in Priangarya, which has entered the economy-class housing construction program.
All necessary documentation is prepared.
Construction of 90 block sections will begin in the near future.
In total, we announced the construction of 10 thousand sq. m. of housing for those wishing to participate in the program a lot.
One of the conditions - the housing should not be more than 30 thousand rubles per square meter, this cost includes a "key" finish.
If we manage the required volumes, we will continue to participate in the program.
As for investors, we also have other interesting projects.
At one time, a Saiyan Pig Complex was built on the territory, which in 2004 was sold for nothing.
We're working with the prosecutor's office to protest this deal.
Especially since the land under the object is federally owned.
Work with Moscow is underway, the issue of the transfer of 88 hectares to the regional property, with the subsequent transfer of land to the municipality.
There is a potential investor, ready to invest in the reconstruction and launch of the project of 1.5 billion rubles.
With the launch of the pig complex, we will have 900 jobs, which will be a great support for the city.
Is the Institute of Social Partnership developed in Saiyansk?
We have concluded about 140 socio-economic partnership agreements.
Many projects have managed to be implemented thanks to the active social position of the representatives of the business.
Sensible support is provided by such enterprises as ZAO "Vostok-Centr", Novo-Ziminska TEC, LLC "Sayansky Broyler", LLC "PK MDF", the management of these enterprises responds to all requests.
Directly to the Day of the city of LLC "Shayansky Broyler" gave the city a children's town, the firm "East-Center" carried out the repair of the horse yard, where specialists deal with children's therapy, costing it more than 1 million rubles.
Thanks to the sponsorship funds, it was possible to repair the territory of the urban ZAGS.
Sponsors helped to mark the city’s day in color.
As in the good old days, there was a parade with the participation of urban groups and organizations.
A journal of the city was published, a book of Saiyan poets.
The first builders and people who make a serious contribution to the development of Saiansk were awarded the anniversary medals.
The mecenaeans also participate in the work of the city charity fund.
The very first step was the acquisition of tools for young talented musicians.
In nine months, more than 800,000 rubles are allocated to support talented children, to help children in need of expensive treatment, to support children from underprivileged families.
How are the social staffing problems solved in Sayansk?
There is a shortage of doctors and teachers in the city.
Providing housing professionals is of paramount importance to address the staffing issue.
Over the past year, we have allocated five apartments for doctors, four teachers have been given service housing.
We have a housing allocation program with the opportunity to privatize it in five years.
In the plans - a replanning of the building, in which eight more apartments for teachers will be built.
Teachers and doctors are also participating in the program "Gile for the Russian family".
In the future - the construction of a house for the employees of the budget area.
Most importantly, there’s a working team in the city with which I can solve the most difficult issues.
It is important to make the right conclusions from all crises, and life will not stop.
The potential of Sayansk and our region is great.
The Duma introduced a bill on the indexation of pensions taking into account the increase in prices.
The State Duma has submitted a bill, which provides for the indexation of social pensions annually from 1 February, taking into account the increase in prices.
The author of the document - a deputy from "Just Russia" Alexander Lomakin-Romyantsev - also proposes to carry out an additional indexation of pensions on 1 April, if the growth rate of the living minimum exceeds the growth rate of prices for goods and services.
The indexation of pensions, according to the current legislation, is carried out annually from 1 April, taking into account the growth rates of the minimum living pensioner in the Russian Federation for the past year.
The bill, introduced in the lower house, provides for the introduction of an indexation of social pensions taking into account the growth rate of consumer prices.
At the same time, the first indexation is postponed to 1 February, and the second to 1 April.
The head of the OSCE said Mogherini was unacceptable to impose sanctions on parliamentarians.
In an official letter to the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs Federica Mogherini, OSCE spokesman Ilkka Kanerva said that sanctions against lawmakers participating in the Assembly’s activities were unacceptable.
This was reported to journalists by the member of the Russian delegation at the autumn session of the OSCE in Ulan-Bator, Nikolay Kovalev.
According to TASS, signatures of European parliamentarians, including representatives of Germany, France, Italy, Cyprus and Greece, have been collected in support of the position of the Canary Islands.
"A sufficiently strong support has already been formed," Kovalev said.
Earlier, he stated that the head of the OSCE PA had expressed the intention of collecting the signatures of the deputies, which indicated the inadmissibility of sanctions against parliamentarians.
In particular, Kovalev noted, Kanerva promised to raise the problem to the level of the EU’s governing bodies and “send the corresponding petition”.
NHC reports that the probability of a cyclone south of the islands of Green Mist is 60 percent
A broad front of a low-pressure area about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern tip of the Green Meadow Islands is 60 percent likely to turn into a tropical cyclone over the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center reported on Tuesday.
Another clearly defined low-pressure area between the Green Mesa Islands and the Small Antilles also has a 60 percent chance of a tropical cyclone forming in the next two days, synoptics from Miami reported.
Google Launches Double Donation Campaign to Collect <0x24>11 Million for Refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) has announced the launch of a campaign to double donations to raise <0x24>11 million for humanitarian organizations to help impoverished European countries refugees fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google used an uncharacteristic personal approach, announcing a donation campaign in its blog.
Instead of making a statement by one of the executives, Google employee Rita Masud, who fled with her family from Kabul when she was seven, described her personal experience.
“We were on dubious trains and buses, we had to endure hunger, thirst, cold and fear,” she wrote.
I'm lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has escalated, many people like my family desperately need help.
The donations will be donated to four non-profit organizations dedicated to aiding refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google has said it will double the first <0x24>5.5 million donations until the amount on the google.com/refugeelief page reaches <0x24>11 million.
Europe is facing the strongest refugee crisis since World War II, caused by most of the four-year civil war in Syria, which has left more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Diabetics with low obesity can help with obesity surgery
The beneficial effect after obesity surgery in people with low obesity with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to claim that diabetics with low obesity live longer after obesity surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatment.
“Death statistics are not immediately manifest,” said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on obesity surgery, who wrote about the new study in the column of the editor of JAMA Surgery.
Obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, uses various methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the ability of the organisms to absorb food.
Over several years, bariatric surgery has proven its effectiveness in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but the main studies were conducted among people with morphine obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
IMT, the measure of weight relative to growth, is considered normal at the range of 18.5 to 24.9.
IMT 25 or higher indicates that a person is overweight, and people with IMT over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your IMT here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For a new study, researchers from the Taiwanese Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery - gastric skull and manic gastritis, with type 2 diabetes medical treatment in people with no pain.
The mean value of IMT in those who underwent surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of their fifth year of participation in the study.
At the same time, IMT in those who received non-surgical treatment for diabetes remains at about level 29.
Among those who underwent surgery, 36% fully recovered from diabetes, and 28% partially.
In the drug-treated group, for comparison, a complete cure for diabetes was observed only in 1%, and a partial cure - only in about 2%.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and “bad” LDL cholesterol scores were “overall better in the surgical group,” the authors say.
The researchers also monitored blood levels of hemoglobin A1s, which reflect blood sugar levels in dynamics.
Hemoglobin A1c is better to keep below 7%, the researchers write.
After surgery, the mean level of hemoglobin A1c decreased from about 9% to about 6%.
In the therapeutic group, however, it remained stable, at about 8%.
But the best glycemic control indicators, reflected by good levels of hemoglobin A1c, did not reduce the mortality rate by five years, according to research lead Dr. Chi-Cheng Su and colleagues.
The study group also compared the average results of two types of surgical treatment.
In the fifth year, compared to the group with half-manual gastricectomy, the shoe group lost more weight (18.7 kg vs. 14.2 kg), achieved a greater reduction in TMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin A1s (3.1% vs. 2.46 %), and also was closer to the sex of 16.
Although a new study does not demonstrate the benefits of the surgical method in terms of life expectancy after five years, there is evidence from the results of a study of people with excess body weight in Sweden that surgical treatment is a fact of the fact that the surgical treatment actually leads to an increase in life expectancy.
According to a Swedish study for obese people who opted for bariatric intervention, the likelihood of dying over 15 years was about 29% lower compared to the group that used more traditional methods.
Although the new study did not show an increase in life expectancy, Blackstone noted that it encourages people with MTI below 35 who are interested in such a procedure.
“This report is very important because it states that surgical intervention is safe in a group with low MRI, where there is no increased risk of mortality or kidney disease,” she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient’s MRI falls into the range from 27 to 30.
"I think we've been waiting too long to get people to take this seriously," she said.
It seems to me that once they accumulate the genetic changes that trigger obesity and diabetes in their bodies, it is very difficult to reverse it.
In Mytish, the robbers took out of the house shoba and 9 million rubles.
In Mytych, the robbers attacked the inhabitants of the sub-Moscow house and stole from them 9 million rubles and three female shoals.
Interfax informs about this with a reference to the press service of the Ministry of the Interior of the Russian Federation.
The incident occurred on Tuesday morning.
Two unknown people through an open door entered the house on Gorky Street, tied the 20-year-old son of the housekeeper and, threatening with both knives, kidnapped 9 million rubles and three shubs.
According to preliminary data, the amount of damage amounted to 9 million 265 thousand rubles, a criminal case was initiated under the article "Razboj".
Fans of Europe are at risk of becoming homeless.
Only 23 hotels in St. Petersburg are eligible to host tourists who will come to see the 2018 World Cup.
The rest of the hotels are not in a hurry to get their permission.
According to experts, this is a very worrying sign.
On the eve of the world championship, the authorities will urgently have to figure out how to relocate all the guests of the city.
Interviewers of Rosbalt believe that because of the tournament, the cost of renting removable apartments will increase by 10-30%, and even after the championship for removable housing will have to be overpaid.
The World Cup has forced the authorities to pay attention to the state of Russian hotels.
According to the law written specifically for the first time, each hotel in St. Petersburg must undergo a classification procedure and prove that it corresponds to the declared number of stars and the level of service.
Already it is clear that not everyone will be able to do this: hoteliers are so afraid of verification that they often do not even send documents at the request of the Federal Antitrust Service in St. Petersburg.
As UFAS head Vadim Vladimirov said, the agency has studied 138 hotels and now plans to launch 34 cases against hotels, many of which simply did not respond to antitrust agents.
There are signs that the management of three dozen companies cheated on the citizen, placing some number of stars in the advertisement, Vladimirov noted.
The problem is that now on the account literally every number, no one can lose before 2018.
Officials suspect that during the football championship fans will occupy all the hotels in St. Petersburg.
Now in the city, tourists can count on 30.5 thousand rooms.
According to Smolno, in St. Petersburg 17 five-star hotels, 51 four-star hotels, 100 - two- and three-star hotels, 550 - one-star hotels.
According to the first Deputy Committee for the Development of Tourism of Nana Guicia, so far only 23 hotels have been classified - so many checks were carried out by accredited companies in St. Petersburg.
But whether any hotel ordered a similar procedure from regional enterprises, Smolny on the surprising number of circumstances is unknown.
That is, there may be more of the past classification, but no one knows about it.
“Over the past six months, hotels have not been very eager to pass classification,” said Yekaterina Shadskaya, Director of the North-West Department of the Russian Tourism Industry Association.
This is due to the high season, during which hoteliers make the most money and do not want to do other business.
Another reason - budgets, in which no expenses for checks were set, while the procedure can be carried out by the hotel depending on the status of 30 to 100 thousand rubles and more.
However, hotel managers have recently become more active and have begun to apply for classification, Shadskaya said.
Hotels must be successful by July 1, 2016, otherwise they will not only pay a fine, but they will still not get the right to work at the World Championships.
It is already known that, depending on the star, a fixed room fee will be developed at the hotel during the tournament.
The formulas for calculating the cost will be published next year.
This is done to prevent price rises of 200-300%, as is the case, for example, during the St. Petersburg Economic Forum.
You need to have a conscience and not allow increases two or three times, but you also need to give hotels to earn.
"I think the growth will be up to 50%," said President of the Russian Hotel Association Gennady Lamshin.
Vadim Vladimirov, in turn, is not sure that the fixation of prices corresponds to the understanding of the market economy.
I don’t know how far this goes in the economic theory, but I hope this measure is justified.
"It's better to travel without restraint," he said.
It is unclear what will happen to popular cheap hostels.
Deputies of the State Duma have passed a bill that says hostels should be banned in residential buildings.
We are very hopeful that this law will not be passed or will not apply to St. Petersburg.
“We will defend the view that hostels should be preserved,” says Nana Guacija.
However, according to her, the owners of mini-hotels in any case should be prepared to tighten the Housing Code.
If the State Duma still approves the bill, about 80% of the hostels in St. Petersburg will be closed, and at the moment there are 1.5 thousand rooms.
According to the President of the Federation of Restaurants and Hotels of the Northwest, Leonid Garbar, there is a shortage of two and three-star hotels in St. Petersburg, which are precisely and in demand by football fans, but there is a gap in the direction of hotels with four and five.
The situation is similar to the situation when "in the 80,000 stadium there are 75,000 whips."
This can be corrected by mini-hotels.
Their possible ban is considered “idiotism”: “I think it’s strange that some people can live in apartments, but here’s why visitors can’t.”
If the hostel is used as a hostel, I agree that this is wrong.
But if it’s like a hotel where guests come for a short period of time, why not?
Mini-hotels risk missing the world football championship and because of their insolvency.
Hundreds of small hotels will simply not be able to pass the classification, and the cave itself.
By the summer of 2016, all hotels in the city will be booked.
"There are not many companies that can carry out this procedure, so they will refuse less-paid orders from mini-hotels, and will choose those that are more expensive," - said Gennady Lamshin, adding that in a number of cities, for example, Moscow and Volgograd.
The reason for the delay in St. Petersburg is due, among other things, to permanent shifts in the government’s tourism bloc, which does not contribute to coordinated work.
According to experts, if St. Petersburg hotels are not enough for everyone, it is likely that you will have to pay attention to regional hotels and holiday homes.
For example, celebrating the 300th anniversary of St. Petersburg in the city can mobilize the river fleet, i.e. the guests of the tournament will be able to live in cabins.
In addition, many fans will be prepared to come in vans, where you can spend the night.
“The main thing is not to set up so many hotels that they will then be emptied,” says Gennady Lamshin.
Also great popularity during the football championship will enjoy removable housing.
Most likely in the city will create a reserve of removable apartments.
Rental rates will increase by 10-30%.
"Of the obvious - the first will leave the housing near the stadium," - said the rental specialist of the Agency for Development and Research in Real Estate Larisa Bragin.
And the rental price may not return to the previous level after the championship, especially in sleeping areas.
This will also contribute to the construction of new transport links on the outskirts of the city, she stressed.
And don’t forget about the human qualities of the people.
For example, Leonid Garbar is confident that St. Petersburg has always been a welcoming city, where people not only point their way, but can also take a mini-tour.
There are also complications.
In the 1970s, my father met a family from Murmansk - a father, a mother and two children.
They had nowhere to sleep: it was difficult for the hotels at the time, it was difficult to sleep at the station.
"And my dad took them to our communal apartment to sleep," the interviewer recalled.
True, he added, that now such a trait in the inhabitants of the city is not left - to call home with consequences and scary.
But maybe in 2018, after the failed decisions of the State Duma, the mistakes of hotels and governments will have to be remembered the former?
Zhirinovsky "found" the Amur region.
Today, I admired the clownage of Zhirinovsky in the State Duma.
He was doing things like this when our generation had just learned to trade newspapers and is still in great shape.
The theme of the speech, it seems, is "the LDP protest against the results of the elections in the Amur region".
The protocols do not shake - because nothing; other protocols other than those signed by the elections, the LDPR, apparently, does not.
Here he raises the second-place Ivan Abramov and shouts something like, "Here he is the winner of the election!"
And immediately nothing is thrown on Rodnin, and then, after meeting already with the chairman, he is bringing the faction out of the meeting room, shouting literally, "You are all with the fronts of your gangsters and thieves."
The press, of course, places emphasis not on Abramov, but on the scandal and march of the faction as a result of this scandal and insult.
Really Wolfovich beautifully and elegantly melted the Amur region together with Abramov.
For the whole country, this is another Zhirinovsky exit in the style of "Podonka!", and not a protest of the political party against the results of specific elections.
And the faction has formally scandalized, and the elections, if you believe the party website and Facebook Ivan Abramov, are not recognized, but the leader of the topic is obviously falling apart.
He gives the dead on Amur to bury their dead, and preaches himself against "United Russia" as a whole and not guilty of anything.
An exquisite solution to not lose a face, and not to go into a real, rather than showy scandal.
The other thing is that Abram himself now finds himself in a strange position.
Apart from the voice of the chief, he did not expect anything, there were no alternative protocols in his hands.
It is not the focus of public attention, on the one hand, but on the other - it is for the narrow circle that it has become a formal reason for insulting the respected champion, and, more importantly, the harassment of ER and OFF cases.
And here, of course, he needs to seriously think about what to do.
Because from the main beneficiary of the election, the policy number 2 of the region and the candidate number 1 for the only regional single-mandant district he can turn into a couple who successfully used their own party leadership and super-irritant for the same NF and party leadership.
It is true that there would be no Zhirinovsky, he should have been invented and watched with respect.
Trump is growing and growing before him.
There was news that the LDPR would return to the room during the next plenary.
I mean, the bathroom fell out of nothing at all.
Only the subject of Abramova was buried under him.
It's really beautiful.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhists called for an end to violence in the countries of refugee homeland.
The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in its speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Compassion Center in Oxford, dedicated to ethics studies, at the beginning of its 10-day visit to the UK.
He stated that in the present circumstances the interests of humanity must be higher than those of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that, although this is admiration, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is not an adequate situation.
“It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe,” he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama was deeply concerned about the actions taken by Germany and Austria in connection with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"Caring for thousands of refugees is great, but at the same time you need to think about long-term solutions to bring real peace and real development, mainly through education, to these Muslim countries," he said.
After all, we need to think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We must weaken the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems,” he added.
Speaking of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George W. Bush’s actions after the terrorist acts of 9/11, saying that the harsh US response has launched a chain of uncontrolled events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that a solution to this problem was possible through non-violence.
“I know his intentions were good, but he used force, and it had unexpected consequences,” the Dalai Lama said.
Fourfold increase in the number of children who have swallowed the hand disinfectant in the last 4 years
Toxicology centers in the United States have reported a nearly 400 percent increase since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 who have swallowed a high-alcoholic hand disinfectant, according to the Georgia State Toxicology Center.
According to Dr. Haylord Lopez, director of the Georgia State Toxicology Center, cases of swallowing children under 12 years of age of hand disinfection fluids reported in toxicological centers increased from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
“Children are in more frequent contact with these substances, and unfortunately, some percent of them are sent to an ambulance,” Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectant fluids specifically, and some do so to make an impression on their friends, or on a social media dispute.
Youtube videos show teens drinking disinfectant liquid as a cheap drink.
Teenagers reportedly mixed the disinfecting liquid with the alcohol-containing mouth rinsing liquid to get a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted to the pleasant smells of disinfecting liquid.
“The child doesn’t think it can hurt him,” Lopez said.
Many of the most attractive (hand disinfectant fluids) are those that are aromatized.
There are disinfecting liquids for the hands with the smell of peanuts, grapes, oranges, which are very attractive for children.
Hand disinfectant fluid contains somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
In young children, in particular, only a few sprays can cause alcohol poisoning.
“This is a high-concentration alcohol,” said Fox 4 in Kansas City, Dr. Steven Thornton, chief physician of the toxicological center at the University of Kansas Hospital.
You wouldn’t just leave a piece of whiskey, but people keep these hand sanitizers in mind, and if children get to them, it’s a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Naija Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed a hand disinfectant with a cauliflower flavor in the amount of about four sprays, was sent to an ambulance.
She had a blood alcohol level of 179, twice as high as an adult who is legally considered to be in a state of alcoholic intoxication, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie, an ambulance doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Naija was confused and unable to walk when she was brought to the ambulance.
Doctors watched her all night in a separate children’s clinic so as not to miss any signs of brain injury, as the girl fell down and hit her head due to alcohol, Ritchie said.
"It was very scary," Ortoria Scott, Naji's mother, told CNN.
It could have been fatal to my child.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic substances or disinfectant towels, in addition to removing disinfectant fluids for hands from the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectant fluids are associated with death.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after swallowing a disinfectant containing a toxic undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol - a deadly agent, not ethyl alcohol, which was indicated as the active substance.
In January, three four-year-old students in northern New York agreed to poison their “opposite” teacher by “spreading antibacterial substances in the classroom,” according to a police report.
The teacher has a strong allergy to hand sanitizers, and she has banned them from keeping in her class.
The police believe the failed plan was "empty talks", and addresses questions of discipline to the school district.
As the oldest children's library in Barnaul became a family club.
On the back of the shelf at the entrance to the peripheral children's library N.K. Krupskaya is saddened by a cast iron oak.
Kids who come after books are trying to feed her with candy.
Several generations have been going to this library for 95 years.
The very first readers in the twenties of the last century arranged loud brushes here, put performances on Mayakovsky's poems, conducted literary quizzes and rewritten with Lenin's wife.
The correspondence lasted four years, and as the newspaper Young Stalinist wrote in 1939, with each day "the friendship between the Hope of Constantine Krupskaya and the friends of the children's library of the city of Barnaul" became stronger.
Konstantinovna’s hope even sent her childhood photograph to distant Barnaul friends once.
And when the Barnaulians asked if Hope Konstantinovna objected to her name being assigned to the library, she wrote that no, she does not object.
The letters have long been sprayed in the museum, and the grandchildren and grandchildren of the first readers have to explain whose rough profile is decorated with a barrel on the building of the library.
In the years of restructuring, different people often called, angry: why is the children's library not renamed?
Let there be a library of the name of some good children's writer, without a political dye!
The library staff sat down, thought, and decided to leave everything as it is.
"Krupskaya" is perhaps the most famous and beloved library in Barnaul, as a "leninka" in Moscow.
On the floor in the library lobby - a trail of yellow brick.
"The Wizard of the Emerald City" is a favorite theme by the artist Oli Moskovka.
Previously, Ola was a manager at a law firm, came to work at eight, left at five, and differed from all the other managers only in the love of drawing.
And then I found an ad on the internet: "You need an illustrator for a book."
The book was written by a little American girl, and she was called "My Cancer Mommy" - "My Mother's Cancer."
Ola made illustrations, and she thought: life can end at any moment, and there will be no miracles in it unless you create them yourself.
Now she works in the library, illustrates children’s books by writers from all over the world, and writes fairy tales herself.
It is traditionally believed that children are losing interest in the book, that they are living more and more in some kind of virtual space.
But some readers come to us, and their parents understand the importance of reading, - says Tatiana Kushvid, director of the library "Russian Planet".
In recent years, we have even had such a moment of confidence that a children’s library is needed, and it will live – the boys are coming here!
I think the interest in reading is coming back.
In the lobby of the library there is a large exhibition window with an updated photo exhibition.
Once a quarter, new photos of readers who go to the library of the whole family: mom, dad and children.
The library is pleased that with the children, dads are coming more and more often.
If at the age of two the child was read all of Chukovsky, at the older age he needs books more complicated.
But now there is a law that prohibits the eight-year-old from publishing books in category 12<0x2B>.
To get such a book, the child must bring with them parents - they come, then return again, and gradually "Krupskaya" becomes something like a family club for them.
There are treasures in the library - a pre-revolutionary collection of bwins with jewels and beads, to take Korolenko in the appendix to the magazine "Niva", the embroidery "Murzilka" for 1936.
After all, we are not only the conceptual space of the "Temple of the Book", we are now open to movement, we are trying to become a special place: not home, not work, not school," explains Tatiana Kushvid.
You can come to us to read, play, draw together.
We have made a play area for kids - the child comes just to play, and the hand is still stretching to the book!
Some of our readers wear it, and they hold their legs, they don’t want to leave.
Often moms come with wheelchairs - and we are pleased that they put the library first among all the other places to come with the kids.
Tatiana Kushvid says: Modern children like us once loved classical children's literature:
“The publishing business is evolving now, and a lot of attention is paid to the authors, who are the inter-generational link.”
And when we talk about little kids, it’s important for them to be a hero who travels from one book to another.
Kids don’t like to break up with their heroes.
The library constantly publishes booklets for parents, in which it tells what is happening in modern children’s literature, which books are worth paying attention to and why.
The booklets are so fascinating and intriguing that adults are interested, but this library is not for them.
It is forbidden to bring books outside the reading room for adults.
This magical privilege is only for children.
...In the farthest room of the library there is a square hall with an ancient wooden staircase in the basement, in the library.
The steps will squeeze under your steps - it's already a very old time machine.
With the book of your childhood you meet like an old friend: hello, it's good that you and I don't change.
Ellie still walks the same fun on the road with a yellow brick, the ribbon of Tol Ryzhikov steals the magic spikes, and Malchish-Kibalchish has never told the damned bourgeois of the Military Secret - that's his firm word.
Such books are like passwords, by which you can know your own anywhere.
There are in the warehouse and real book rarities - for example, a pre-revolutionary collection of bwins with sharks and herbs.
Or take Korolenko in the famous app for the magazine "Niva".
Or the "Murzilki" embroidery for 1936.
The pages have become old, they have been painted in tea.
These publications are no longer available to readers.
These are fragments of our future collection, I dream of all - I'm going to retire and take care of rare children's books.
But the children will not be able to do that: and the paints in the old books are not very bright, and the topics... you open the first page, and there is Lenin, the party, the commodore.
Now it seems: why did we all write this "Pioner Truth"?
But it was still interesting, - says "Russian Planet" Galina Ilyasov, managing the bookstore.
The pages of "Freezes" have been darkened from time to time.
Galina Vasilyevna will lead the bookstore her whole life.
She knows the color of the hoods in Buratino, in what school year Harry Potter became the captain of the Griffindor team at the quiz championship, in what situations Carlson uses a motorcycle silencer, and who his father, Alice Selezneva, works for.
Little is paid for the job of a librarian, and anyone who can live without these rows of books finds a different profession very quickly.
Only the most convinced remain: educators, pedagogues, servants of the book cult.
They can also be recognized by a smile - it is believed to be a professional trait of a children's librarian.
If he smiled at you in the first minute of the conversation, he was a professional.
I love children’s books in general: as a librarian, I like that they are to stand flat and beautifully on the shelves, and I also love to read them,” says Galina Vasilyevna.
I read everything: military, historical stories, fairy tales, fantasy.
I read modern Russian authors, fresh translations...
Of course, I think in my childhood everything was different.
The books were the most interesting and exciting of all that happened to me at the time.
And since I loved them insanely, I thought the library was a magical place.
And I wanted to work where everyone sits and reads.
I hope that the books will always be, despite the readers.
And I'm glad that our former readers bring children, and even grandchildren...
Hearing mill: There is no disagreement in "Seltika"
Griffiths denied talks about disagreements in the Celtic after Dale admitted that the Hops were in bad shape, but he would fix it.
Harts will protest against a claim by the Scottish Football Association against Nelson, and Warberton is afraid of signing contracts in January that could violate the team’s unity.
"Dons" increased advantage over "Celtic" to five points
Adam Runi's penalty in the first time gave Aberdeen a small advantage over Hamilton in Pittsburgh, which allowed Dons to break away from Celtic by five points.
Griffiths denies talks about disagreements
This sparked rumors of disagreements in the Celtic, which were shattered by Griffiths, who said he and his teammates were not suffering from any increased criticism while preparing for a meeting with the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don’t think we’re feeling the tension, I think the players are looking for it.
The Dutch are bored because the Scots are not in the fight for the title – de Bour
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch team member Ronald de Burr said Dutch football fans had lost interest in the Celtic as he did not compete for the title with the Rangers.
De Bour, now a representative of Ajax, said: "The most attractive moments of Celtic games in the Netherlands are no longer shown, and why?"
That's because there's no Rangers.
People here don't just talk about the return of the Rangers.
They're talking about the old company.
They talk about the two teams together, and that’s what they’re interested in.
There is a lot of tension in Old Company games, and not only people in Scotland want to see these games.
“I’ll change everything,” Dale said.
Ronnie Dale admitted that the Celtic is in trouble, but the Norwegian coach has sworn to change everything.
Following the defeat of Malmö and, as a result, leaving the Champions League soon followed the loss of 10 Aberdeen players, who now, breaking five points, occupies the top row of the table.
However, Dale said, “The City had bad periods before and we’ll get out again.”
Now we want to get out of it as soon as possible.
I understand that it’s very annoying, and a lot of people are very, very angry or upset about what’s going on.
We too, but we have to keep going.
And we really, really, really need the support of Celtic because it makes the players much better.
It's so important to stay together now.
Warberton untrustworthyly awaits January transfers
Despite opinions that appeared only a couple of weeks ago suggesting that he had defined some of the goals of the January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warberton is distrustful of the January campaign, claiming that he does not want to destroy the unity of the team.
The former Brentford attacker said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
As for the players who come in the summer, you have a period before the start of the season to adapt them, which you have seen in our own group this season.
The team works really well.
Sometimes more damage is caused by adding unnecessary players to the ones you really need.
Mitch, who is interested in "Seltic", hinted at the end of his career
Attacker Soonsi Mitch, who was tied to the Celtic during the transfer window, suggested he could leave football after his contract with the Leeds ended.
The 29-year-old has been suffering from ankle problems for two years and was unable to leave Wales this summer.
"Harts" are going to fight the SFA over Nelson's claims
The Harts led with a 2:1 score when Patterson was removed, and they started to lose 3:2, but the defender's red card was later cancelled; this was Columbus' third red card, cancelled in eight months.
Neilson does not give up on his words, stating, "I did not question ethics, I did not comment on the game."
Griffiths sworn to avoid Tynkasl
The hardcore player of the Haybernian team got a verdict after admitting that he sang a song with insulting words about former "Harts" player Rudy Scaccel.
The incident took place in a pub in the Roseburn district of Edinburgh before the Edinburgh Derby at the Steinkasla in March 2014.
"It was a derby, and it was hot," the attacker said, adding, "I can say with confidence that I wasn't going to go back to the Tynecastle unless he plays for the Celtic."
Donnelli: Tannadis Council confident in the management of "Dandy United"
Simon Donnelly argues that the board of directors of "Dandy United" is still confident that the team of managers will change the situation for the better, but agrees that the deterioration of the situation on the ground should end.
I think Steven Thompson believes in us.
We're going to get the guys out again," Donnelly said.
McKinness is pleased that "unbelievable" won at Hamilton
Derek McKinness admitted that his Aberdeen team had to fight desperately against Hamilton Assis to win the league's seventh consecutive championship, which put them five points above the Celtic, at the top of the tournament table, thanks to the first penalty.
McInnes said: “There is no such team that would win anything – a cup or a league championship that hasn’t won a match like that.”
Unemployment rate among Scots remains unchanged, while in the UK as a whole it is growing.
THE number of unemployed in Scotland remained at 164,000 between May and July, while the number of unemployed in the United Kingdom increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland, 5.9%, was higher than in the United Kingdom by 5.5%, according to figures from the National Statistics Service (ONS).
At the same time, employment in Scotland declined by 12,000 in three months, with the number of workers now being 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell by quarter to 74.0% - higher than the average of 73.5% for the United Kingdom.
Scottish Affairs Minister David Mandell, commenting on the latest figures, noted: "The long-term plan of the government laid the foundations for strengthening the economy."
Almost exactly a year has passed since Scotland made the historic decision to remain a part of the United Kingdom.
Over the past 12 months, we have seen further improvements in Scotland’s labour market with the rise in employment and the decline in unemployment.
Why I'm a witness to an execution in Oklahoma
Today, avoiding legal interference at a later stage, I will watch a man be executed.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'll be sitting at the death chamber's observation gallery in Oklahoma State Prison when Richard Glossip is executed by a deadly injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
The first time this request was made in January, through his close friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As this day approached, I began to fear.
So why would you do that?
I agreed, because I thought it was a good way to tell a detailed history of the death penalty.
This would offer a unique curriculum.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend executions in America, and since those who want more than places often, the results of the dark lottery decide who will be chosen.
In Oklahoma, the number of press spaces has been reduced from 12 to five.
Whoever he chooses, he will look at it without emotion.
I can't do that.
I’ll sit down with Richard Glossip’s closest friends, and we’ve had our own relationship with him after a few months of phone calls and one visit lasting two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We often laugh when we talk to him.
The prison administration claims that I can’t be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I won’t be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
A reporter from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of abusing my impartiality.
That's a lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner as he likes, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she "would have formulated better" herself, but still believes that I'm wrong in what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip did not agree with any of what I said and wrote.
He didn’t tell me what to write, and I wouldn’t do it even if he said it.
I told him he could get me out of his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international press journalist to be there to write about it.
If he dies, he believes that publicity will help the abolition movement of the death penalty.
Kim Bellver, a reporter from the Hawkington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about this case, listen to the podcasts I recorded.
I'm not going to go in the details again.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip isn't guilty.
His actions after the murder of Barry van Treeze make him guilty of complicity in the crime.
But I believe there's a high probability that he's not guilty of murder.
I am sure that the evidence for the death penalty was insufficient.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from this point on, I'll watch him die.
I can’t say I’m completely objective.
There will be other reporters who can be contacted.
From me, you will learn what it is like to watch the person I like die unnecessarily.
The man who was chased by police was persuaded to exit the Kanning River.
A constable from Canning Valley managed to persuade a man to leave the Canning River and to stay dry.
The resident of Perta intended to escape from the police, but failed, trapped in dirty water on a shallow water a few meters away from the police officer, trying "softly to persuade him to get off the coast".
Canning-Weila police were summoned on Tuesday for illegally penetrating foreign territory in Bakinggem.
When the police spotted the suspect, he tried to get away from them, rushing to Canning.
But he didn't swim far.
"He was standing in the water and said, 'I'm not going out, come on, catch me,'" Sgt. Chandel Castledin said.
Constable Laklan Perchavec was not very willing to urinate the form, so he used a safer reception - "conversations with a good policeman".
“Sometimes people do strange things to try to escape,” said Sergeant Castledian.
Footballer-champion Ben Kazins is exactly what he remembers.
In 2006, Kazins went to the quay to avoid a meeting with the police patrol to check for alcohol, and tried to cross Swan.
His efforts turned out to be futile, but prompted locals to invent the joking "Ben Kasin's Biathlon".
Peter Moody Accuses Stewards of Attempting to Spy and Threaten to Leave Horse Sports
Peter Moody accused the drivers of Racing Victoria of trying to deploy a spy into his horsehouse last year and threatened to immediately leave the horse sport.
His targets were the drivers and staff of the ethics department Racing Victoria, whom he accused of organising a campaign against him personally, and the removal of Lady Tatai from the start due to violations of drug rules on the day of the start, on Wednesday, became the last step.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always put all his efforts into jumping, and he was in a difficult situation when it came to the positive outcome of the Leaders' Cobalt test, which he could not explain.
He held his tongue on suspicion of espionage for a year and a half and didn’t want it to “look like a green grape.”
"I wasn't going to say anything about it, and I've been patient for a long time, but sometimes it kicks you out of the wheel so much that you're not holding back anymore," Moody said.
They know that it went on.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to go through the consequences, and I'm gonna have to live with what I said.
I'm going home today and I'm going to sleep hard.
I want to walk with a high head and I want my owners to know – I’m doing everything possible for them.
When they start to think that’s not the case, then I’m going to have to stop being a coach.
Then I'll have to think about what to do with my license.
Earlier, Moody sensationally stated during an interview on racing.com that the ethics department was trying to spy on his horse.
“Half a year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with the man I’ll call if asked, and offered him a job in my riding room to pass on information about what I was doing in my riding room,” he said.
They clearly think I'm a fraudster.
If that is the case, they should all, without a doubt, file an application, since they failed to try to catch me.
Robert Rollstone, former RVL chairman, David Moody, current RVL chairman, and Bernard Sondry, current RVL CEO, knew about this all the time and they know it now.
Shouldn’t that make me think that it’s personal?
Shouldn’t RVL have the courage to take responsibility for what’s going on in this business, other people besides coaches?
Am I bad for this profession?
Am I bad for this profession?
Maybe people there think that's the way it is.
Maybe they need to take my license and push me away, and I don't doubt that what I'm saying right now can make them think about it.
But I've reached a point where I don't care, and that's saddening me.
I'm really sad about that.
I will put pressure on them and put responsibility on them for their decision-making.
I have support from my family, and I can leave.
The coach’s anger only grew during a long investigation into the case with Cobalt and Lidari, and the last withdrawal of the horse from the start forced him to say that he could “sweep his license on the table.”
Moody, best known for preparing the invincible champion Black Caviar, called the demands for the use of medical drugs on the day of the competition " ridiculous" after the horse's legs were put on a clay compress, which is a violation of the rules.
It's a violation of the rules of jumping.
“I have to bear full responsibility for this,” he said.
One of my employees accidentally made a compression on her leg.
She could've gotten a compress last night.
She could have gotten it yesterday, as it was.
She was with him on the day of the race.
Moody may be disqualified for three months according to the rules on the use of medical drugs on the day of compressive competitions, for which the stewards opened an investigation.
It's an anecdote.
The people who make these rules don’t know anything about horses.
“We all understand that we need rules, but it has gone too far,” Moody said.
The driver who made the raid and hiding from the scene of the accident in Cobrama, arrested
Police arrested a man who crashed a motorcyclist in Cobra this weekend and hid from the scene.
A motorcyclist was taken by helicopter to Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after he was hit by a car on Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver left without stopping to help the injured motorcyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old resident of the city Natalia surrendered to police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with leaving the scene of the accident, failing to prove assistance and violating other traffic rules.
The motorcyclist, a 40-year-old resident of Kobrama, remains in the hospital in a stable condition.
Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy Pairs Competitors' Accusations of Using Hard Force Receptions
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy called his team's criticism of the interception of the ball a "fixing the agenda" on the side of two NRL championship favourites.
Sydney Rusters coach Trent Robinson said the judges allowed Storm to "fight" with his team during Storm's sudden victory in the final of the qualifying game in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a clear hint on Storm after his team won the final of the qualifying tournament at the Nozern Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, when he called the game "typical" and "religious".
The Bellamy defended the interception of the ball by his team and said they were just focused on the "contact" by intercepting the ball.
Bellamy added that his team's criticism of the two leading coaches had added confidence in him, as this meant that they were worried about a possible defeat from Storm.
"This continues to emerge - I haven't heard Trent Robinson talk about the tough moves when they beat us 24:2," Bellami said on Wednesday.
“I can tell you that we haven’t changed anything in our systems or defense techniques for a whole year, but over the last six weeks we’ve paid special attention to the contacts when the ball is intercepted, and this has become a turning point for us.
Trent has been there for three years and he is clearly training a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, and it's been a bit of a shock to him.
It’s funny how it always happens at this time of year.
Bellami argued with Bennett's idea of "impressive football" by reminding his teacher that the St. George-Illavarra Dragons won the championship in 2010, showing "dull" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday night with ours on Friday night, and to see how impressive their game was," Bellami said.
I remember that in 2010, St. George was criticised a lot by calling a boring team, and Wayne said he didn’t care.
But now he has a team that can show what he thinks is impressive football, especially his young midfielders with their speed.
It’s the football you would like to play when you have such players.
He made this remark in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play football in his style – not every team has two defenders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play that way.
This gives me more confidence because they say these things, because a few of them bother playing with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn’t think about us when they got to the big games.
Bellami also noted that the game Storm and Rusters was a competition with more points than the game Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably good, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the score? 16-12?
In our game he was 20:18, there were two more attempts - and what, is that an impressive football?
Or consider impressive breaks and unsuccessful attempts?
It's a routine for me.
If they mention us, it means that at some point we can meet them there.
The Storm has won the right to accept either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Coronal Sharks on Saturday night at the preliminary final at AAMI Park Stadium, and tickets will be on sale next Sunday.
Accused of storing drugs Serb released under bail of <0x24>200,000
A man who was threatened with life imprisonment for attempting to allocate 40 kg of cocaine delivered to Queensland by smuggling was released on bail for <0x24>200,000.
Marko Maximovich, 29, is one of five people arrested last month after federal police found 100 kilograms of drugs on the Solay yacht, which sailed from South America through Vanuatu and landed in Kumer in August.
Throughout the morning, Maximovich and his colleagues were seen at the harbor, and later he met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 kg of drugs in a Toyota Echo car.
Despite the fact that Maximovich is threatened with a lifetime for attempting to assign drugs in quantity, enough for sale, the lawyer Maximovich claims that the evidence that the latter was trying to get the whole party is missing.
High Court Judge Peter Flanagan doubted that Maximovich should be released under bail.
The latter has ties with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia,” he said in court on Wednesday.
During the criminal proceedings, he lied to the police about his location.
The mother and stepfather of Maximovich were invited to make a joint pledge of <0x24>200,000 for his release.
“It becomes clear from the testimony of both that the amount of the <0x24>200,000 deposit is too much financial burden for them,” Judge Flanagan said.
But one of these measures is not enough as a guarantee that it will not disappear, the judge added.
Maximovich was allowed to be released under bail on condition that he will hand over both his Australian and Serbian passports, will be marked in the police daily and observe the commanding hours from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Fotis Kacikaris: "I'm proud of the team of Greece that fought until the last seconds."
Greece's head coach Fotis Kacikaris paid tribute to his team after the 1/4 match of the 2015 Eurobasket final with Spain (71:73).
According to him, the fate of the game was solved by individual mistakes.
“It was a big game,” AFP quoted Katzikaris as saying.
We were preparing for a great game with the Spaniards.
They tried to work out in defense, but the errors in defense determined the fate of the meeting.
It's sad, but I'm proud of my kids.
They fought until the last second.
Joel Freeland: "The CSKA will charge me with the functions of Kaunas."
CSKA novice Joel Freeland said he does not believe in the curse of the army.
The British also expressed confidence that his new club will be able to break the negative trend and finally win the Euroleague next season.
I spoke to coach Dimitris Itudis several times this summer and, after myself, after joining the team, - quotes "R-Sport" Freeland. - In fact, I will be assigned the functions of Sasha Kaun, the one who left the team, as in the defense, and in the other buildings.
Yeah, I'll take some time to reset to the central position, but in the NBA, I played forward more.
Now we'll have to fight more against the big central rival, but I've done this before, so I think I can do it now.
The Army won the Euroleague for the last time in 2008.
Since then, they have reached the Final Four six times, but they have not been able to show their best basketball every time.
There is a feeling that the team has been spotted by someone.
In this whole game, you can't win forever.
Of course, this is difficult, I understand all the disappointment of the club and its fans.
But we have a great team right now, and if we are going to show the best we can do, we have a good chance of winning the Euroleague, I really think so.
I have always wanted to win this title, the Moscow people have already won the tournament, and I think this year will be the year of CSKA.
As for the eye, I'm not a superstitious person and I don't believe in any curses.
I believe in hard work and determination, if you combine these two things, then anything is possible.
I don’t have any specific rituals before the games, I just listen to music and try to relax as much as possible.
Luis Enrique: “For me, the match against Rome will be special.
The head coach of Barcelona, Luis Enrique, did not begin to hide that he returned to Rome for the first round of the Group Tournament of the Champions League with Rome with special feelings.
According to the mentor, the eyeball of his current and former team will be far from ordinary for him.
Luis Enrique coached the wolves in the 2011/12 season, but failed to prove himself on the best side in the Italian capital.
I returned to Rome a few years later, for which I have gained some experience. - according to the official UEFA website of Luis Enrique.
I have very warm memories of Rome.
It’s going to be a special game for me, but it’s not that important.
The main thing is to start in the Champions League with a win.
The August meeting at the Joan Gambera Cup will not affect the actions of the teams in the upcoming match.
I expect from Rome the game she showed in Serie A against Juventus.
It’s a strong team that can press and know what to do with the ball.
Vadim Skripchenko: "Krasnodar" has different options of attacking actions."
The acting head coach of "Ural" Vadim Skripchenko in the pre-match of the 9th round of the Premier League with "Krasnodar" noted the variety of attacking schemes of the opponent's team.
According to the mentor, "bugs" have several models of the game in their arsenal in attack.
The fight will take place on September 21st and will begin at 16.30 Moscow time.
How we will play with "Krasnodar", let's see - the official website "Ural" words Skripchenko.
We have a whole week of training ahead of us.
This team has different options of attacking actions, performs its attacks in a variety of ways, and at the same time we are not a slow team, so I think it will be a very interesting game.
At the forefront of this game, considering that Krasnodar is holding the Europa League match against Dortmund "Borussia", we will try very well to prepare to win.
Roger Canyons: "Astana's house can pick up glasses from anyone."
Defender of Astana, Roger Kanyas, after the match of the 1st round of the Champions League Group Tournament with Benfica (0:2), expressed confidence in improving the quality of his team's game in the future.
According to Habbek, in their field, the Astanians are able to remove the glasses from any opponent.
"Despite the fact that the match was difficult for us, I can say that we played well," the official UEFA website said in a statement to Kanyas.
"Benfica" is higher than class, but in a home game, I think we can count on them to pick up their glasses.
That's real.
But first you have to think about the Galatasaray, and then about the Athletic.
In home games, we can pick out glasses from anyone.
Rafael Benitez: “I repeat as many times as possible: Cristiano Ronaldo is the best in the world.”
Real Madrid head coach Rafael Benitez expressed satisfaction with a major victory in the match of the 1st round of the Champions League Group Tournament with the Shakhter (4:0).
The specialist paid tribute to forward Cristiano Ronaldo, who became the author of the three goals.
The match was not easy because the chess player is capable of owning the ball, according to the official UEFA website Benitez.
The opponent did not have many moments, but their counterattacks always hide the danger.
“I’m not saying that Real Madrid played perfectly, but we had enough of the goals.
“I’m glad we didn’t miss the ball and scored four.
Cristiano Ronaldo has confirmed his level.
He’s the best player in the world, I’ll repeat it as many times as I can.
Jorge Alba: “Christian Ronaldo cannot be compared to Messi.”
Barcelona defender Jordi Alba believes that no one will be able to compare to his clubmate Lionel Messi.
According to the Spaniard, Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo can’t do that either.
“Messi is five-headed above the others,” says Le Figaro Albu. “What Leo can do, no one can do.”
Even Cristiano Ronaldo.
With Leo on the field, everything changes, I can't compare him to anyone.
Daniel De Rossi: "Barcelona" has not only a unique style, but also bright individualities.
Defender of Rome Daniel De Rossi on the eve of the group tournament of the Champions League with Barcelona noted the importance of compactness and insurance in the game with such a strong rival.
The meeting will be held tomorrow, starting at 21.45 Moscow time.
Let us remind you, the “CE” will carry out its text transmission.
"Barcelona is a special rival, a good team with great players," said the official website of UEFA De Rossi.
With blue-granets it is difficult to play, because they have not only a unique style, but also bright individualities.
To leave them, we'll have to sneak through the whole game and insure each other.
Messi is almost always successful when it comes to overlapping, so we need to maintain compactness and organization.
Ezhov hopes to come out in the starting team of SKA in the match with "Slovan".
SKA goalkeeper Ilya Ezhov stressed that he hopes to go out in the starting team of the army in the next match of the KHL championship.
Ezhov came out on the ice instead of Mikko Koskinen in the 23rd minute with a score of 0:3 and reflected all the throws on his goal, the fourth goal of the SCA missed after replacing the goal with the sixth field player.
The next match will be played at the exit against Slovan.
I hope I will be out in the next match in the starting team, - says "R-Sport" in the words of Ezhov.
I'm not an expert on goalkeepers, I'm a goalkeeper myself, we don't show repeats of lost heads, so it's hard to track.
"Dynamo" played well, everyone had bad matches.
The team has lost anyway.
I would have missed more, but the team won.
Shafarzhova was admitted to the hospital with a viral infection.
Lucy Shafarzhova is hospitalized with a bacterial infection, AFP reports.
Currently, the Czech tennis player is in the clinic in Brno.
It is not yet known if Roland Garros-2015 will be re-enacted.
We also recall that on Monday Shafarzhova rose to one row in the WTA ranking and is now the fifth rocket in the world.
Steven Hogg used a girl’s phone to force pedophiles to send pictures
The pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to question images of violence against children.
Steven Hogg picked up the girl's phone while she was sleeping, registered to the online messaging service, where he received a number of improper images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up, found the missing phone and found it in the sleeping Hogg’s hand.
She checked it out and found shocking photos, then immediately turned her mother’s attention to it.
The police came and saw five images, after which they searched the computers found at this address, and found "relevant" queries in the search engine using words to detect inappropriate images of children.
Hogg then told the police that he did it because it could "attract pedophiles" and then he would "pretend to be a policeman to frighten them."
Commissioner of Justice Eileen Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff's Court: "He said it was an addiction, he became addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he was making requests on the computer, but said it was because he wanted to pretend to be a police officer to intimidate the pedophiles.
He was questioned about a conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures, and that he asked for more photos.
He said he did it to attract them.
He said he had a headache when he drank, and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added: “When the girl found the photos on her phone, she called her mother, trembled and cried.
She saw abusive images on the phone, and then the accused was held an eye-catching bet.
The girl was interviewed and reported that the accused used the computer and the Plaisance to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, from Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to the allegations of making improper child photographs on June 14 last year, violating the terms of the bail on January 25 of this year and not attending a hearing on March 24 of this year.
The defendant's lawyer, Gregor Sim, appealed not to include Hogg on the list of persons who committed sexual offences, as it can be proved that there was no "significant sexual element" in the crime.
Sheriff Alister Carmichael postponed the sentence until October, until he received testimony from social services.
Hogg was released on bail in this case, but he was detained before hearings on the other remaining cases began.
It was included in the list of persons who committed sexual offences before the date of the sentence.
Zimbabwe’s President Robert Mugabe reads the wrong speech in parliament
Mr. Mugabe, the oldest head of state in Africa, fell from the staircase leading from the podium earlier this year.
He was not injured, but the video with the scene of the fall immediately spread on social networks.
The opening of parliament was also obscured by statements by parliamentary opposition members that they had received anonymous threats warning them of Mugabe’s whistleblowing during the speech.
A month ago, they scoffed at the president during his address to the nation in parliament; that was what Mugabe repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Goneze, a member of parliament from the Movement for Democratic Change, said seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones warning not to interrupt Mugabe’s speech.
"The message came from a number that is not displayed, but it is titled 'Death'," he told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
It warned the nominated Members of Parliament that inviolability ends in the Parliament building, and once they leave, parliamentary inviolability does not apply.
A member of parliament said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, was "concerned" about the threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard plans to cut from 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost-cutting program.
In the same year, Hewlett-Packard will split into two publicly traded companies, separating the production of computers and printers from the fastest-growing hardware and service operations sectors.
Deductions as a result of the projected job cuts will amount to about <0x24>2.7 billion, starting in the fourth quarter, Hewlett-Packard said in a statement.
“Such a restructuring will provide a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, chairman and CEO of Hewlett Packard, who will lead the company after the split.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be less and more focused than Hewlett-Packard at the moment, and the portfolio of business directions will be wider and deeper, which will help the company move to a new business style,” Whitman said.
As an individual company, we are in a better position than ever before to respond to the growing demands of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenues of more than <0x24>50 billion and “will be focused on providing companies with previously unattainable integrated technology solutions,” the company said in a statement.
This is how the company, formed in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard for the production of electrical equipment; their garage in Palo Alto was called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley".
Hewlett Packard is in the process of a large-scale reorganization to move from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move by HP, the world’s second-largest personal computer manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies, is the latest in the sector, based on the confidence that highly specialized companies work better.
Arsenal captain Michel Arteta says his teammates should support injured Jack Wilshire before playing with Dynamo Zagreb.
In a conversation with Wilshire, Wenger also stressed that it was only September, and that provided that Wilshire's recovery would go as planned, nothing would prevent him from returning to the game for Christmas.
With the most favorable development of events, Wilshire will definitely miss at least the next four games in England and, given what happened, his participation in the European Championship next summer remains in question.
The most outrageous of all in this recent issue is that Wilshire confidently ended the previous season with the only knee injury and was going to return to the usual aggressive style of the game during pre-season training.
Wenger: “This injury does not threaten his career.”
It's just not the end of the bone.
There's nothing serious.
It's just a coincidence.
It is not related to ankles or injuries that he had experienced before.
These may be medically related things, but, as Wenger also admitted, there is a risk associated with this of additional injuries for any player returning to the game in the middle of the season.
There is also an unfavorable trend.
According to Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshire has recorded 23 different injuries that occurred to him in the six years since his debut.
In addition, he played only 65 of Arsenal's 157 games in the league for the last five seasons.
If you look at the schedule for Arsenal more broadly, you can notice that in six of the eight seasons, starting in 2007-08, Arsenal was one of the two Premier League clubs with the most missed due to injury days.
Wenger acknowledges the likelihood of being stuck in a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that improvements in injury statistics in the final season will continue.
“Sometimes, when you get back in shape after an injury, you’re vulnerable for a while — during this time you need to regain strength and gain a competitive advantage,” he said.
Jack is young enough to do it.
“I hope he will recover physically, I’m sure, and I’m sure his career will be what he deserves.
Arsenal starts the Champions League campaign on Wednesday with a match with Dynamo-Zagreb and will continue it on Saturday with Chelsea and next Wednesday with Tottenham Hotspur, and Wenger intends to rotate the team.
Hector Belerin and Aaron Ramsey did not come to Croatia, so they are likely to play Matteo Debushi and Arteta in the starting line-up.
It is possible that Wenger will also include Kiran Gibbs and Olivier Jiru instead of Nacho Moreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and give a little breath to the players who need it," Wenger said.
Although "Arsenal" is an unconditional favourite in Group F, the stadium "Maximir" in Zagreb is among the most shocking in Europe.
"Dynamo" have not lost any of the 41 games since they managed to spend last season as "Invincible".
On Tuesday evening, the stadium was hit by an earthquake with a force of 3.2 points on the Richter scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is confident that Arsenal has learned the lesson of last season when the team was defeated in the Monaco Champions League game, and remains with little hope to lead the club to the Champions Cup final.
"It's an incredible drive," said Wenger.
Arsenal has never done that before.
We were very close to the goal in 2006, but on the other hand, I am a realist with an internship.
We have ambitions, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that taught us serious lessons of male friendship
The lack of such stories is overlooked, especially considering how desperate the need for honesty for men has become now more than ever, with the suicide rate among young men at a maximum of 15 years.
In 2013, it was the only leading cause of death for men between the ages of 20 and 45 in the United Kingdom, and occurs with men three times more often than with women.
In an attempt to figure out the “Campaign Against Unhappy Life” issue, 2015 was declared the Year of Men in order to challenge a culture that does not allow men to seek help when they need it.
Friendship is at the center of this battle to take on this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 university students with symptoms of depression found that if the patient had enough friends “in a normal mood,” the chances of healing doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, the circle of mentally healthy friends doubles the chances of mental disorders.
But, of course, for friendship to work, first of all, it needs to be.
In an age when communication is managed by social networks, when style prefers content, response speed is often more valued than content contact.
Our digital life doubles the need to seem strong, fun-loving and successful, even when solitude is in reality.
Such superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values - money, image, social status, entirely at the expense of internal values, our inner aspiration for personal growth and friendship, which has a stronger impact on our healthy soul.
And, as one billionaire recently noted, the creator of video games, for money, you don’t buy more happiness at all.
The advantage of Friends is that they attract attention to this.
Each of the characters was determined not through their work, but rather through a personality that appeared in communication with friends.
Joey’s humour and Chandler’s constant hugs, the moments of watching football in comfortable chairs, Ross’s breathing of Rachel – it all comes from the understanding that men can feel it, even if they often refrain from a thorough study of their senses.
As an employee of Samaritants told me, “...my role as a listener for people who feel depressed and suicidal moods emphasizes how even the slightest communication of friends can benefit.”
Often, the men who turn to us don’t feel able to talk to our friends.
The old teaching of "living with it" is strong, as is the feeling that an honest conversation about problems can be perceived as a weakness.
Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I try to offer more continuous mechanisms of overcoming.
It highlighted the unremarkable moments of male friendship.
As for my task, the status of a stranger talking on the phone helps people in times of despair, while long-term support comes from a close family and friends.
So, if you’re visiting FriendsFest at Comedy Central this weekend, where the decorations have been completely restored for the holiday, why not take your friends to drink at Central Perk.
Or, better yet, if you see a single person at Starbucks, smile and say "Hi".
Don’t guess in advance what a friendship can bring.
The series Friends show on Comedy Central from the beginning to the end, all 236 series, by tag <0x23>FriendsFest
Di Maria scores a goal by helping the PSG defeat the Malmö
Angel di Maria, along with Bleza Matthewi and Edison Kavanaugh, celebrates the balls in the Malmö goal.
Angel di Maria, debuting in the Champions League, scored a goal that allowed the PSG to easily bypass the Malmö on Tuesday.
Here is a report on the match and the reaction of the game.
Angel di Maria and Edinson Cavani did their job when Paris Saint-Germain started their Champions League game with an extremely comfortable 2-0 win against Malmö at the Park de Princes Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored the ball less than four minutes after his first Champions League game began as a PSG player to set a goal for the French champions, but they missed a number of opportunities before finally gaining their advantage when Kavanaugh was over.
Along with Real Madrid and Donetsk's Shakhter in Group A, Pari had to get a good start in the game against Sweden's champions, as they were not aimed at the play-off qualification, but at the continuation of a series of successful games of the last three seasons.
They earned points, but at the same time it was not the best decision by Laurent Blan to consider Zlatan Ibrahimovic useless in the attack and later replace him on the field in the game against the team from his hometown and the club where he started his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or at the guests in the Champions League, so winning with a score of 2:0, bringing problems to the opponents and playing well in defense is a good start, even if there are other moments that we will need to improve during the season," Blan said.
It's promising.
We wanted to win, and we did it, although I regret that we didn’t score one or two more balls.
Ibrahimovic returned after an injury in one of the replacements in the Paris team, which brought her a 2-2 draw in the match against the Bordo in the First League on the weekend, but put him back in the back of Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentinian attacker was noted as a player capable of bringing the PSG to a new level in Europe after he was redeemed last month from Manchester United, and he proved why when he was smuggled to the pass by Joaquim Joaquim, the smuggler behind the protection of the Maltese.
However, if someone expected then from the "PSG" a light and big victory, they had to be disappointed.
The Malmö, which defeated the Celtic in the playoffs to reach this stage, had nine world-class players on the field at the start of the game, five defenders and two half-backs in the middle of the field, was a serious opponent.
But with the exception of Nicholas Giurgitsch’s strike, in which the ball flew past Kevin Trapp’s far-flung goal in the 34th minute, they attacked quite a bit.
But "PSG" sometimes led himself by unsuccessful transmissions and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimovic, who only in the first half was unable to carry out at least five attempts, and then was unable to process the ball, killed by Kavani immediately after the rehearsal.
However, he proved to be much more skilled in precise pass, and this was a pass from Ibrahimovic, who, Di Maria, sent the ball with a twisted blow, which passed to the stick past Vilande for 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally scored after a time mark thanks to Kavanaugh, the Uruguayan scored his sixth ball in the season after Ibrahimovic scored the ball sent to the center of the field with Maxwell's left flank.
This put an end to any ideas that Malmö had about returning to the game, and only the interception of the ball by Viland from a close distance did not allow David Lewis to increase the final count before the horse who had been replaced by Ezekiel Lavessy did not count.
Malme coach Age Harried later admitted that PSG was a class higher than his team, while the Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League game took place in December last year."
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, and this is not the level.
Qualifications are insufficient.
Glory to "Money"!
It was a great match with them.
Glencore Makes <0x24>2.5 Billion to Sell Shares
Based in Switzerland, mining and trading giant Glencore, which has been hit by a drop in commodity prices, has earned <0x24>2.5 billion on the sale of shares as part of its grand debt reduction plan.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, has announced that it has sold new shares worth about <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion to pay off its debt.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value, is trying to cope with the fall in commodity prices while China’s economic downturn worsens demand and creates chaos in world markets.
Thanks to the issuance of new shares at a discounted price, Glencore's stock price on the London Stock Exchange flew up early in the morning on Wednesday.
Stocks jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which traded 0.69 percent higher at the time of opening.
Glencore began selling <0x24>2.5 billion in shares last week as part of extensive plans to reduce its <0x24>30 billion debt by about a third.
The company sold new shares for 125 cents per item, with a 2.4 percent discount at the price at the closing of the trade on Tuesday.
It has deposited 1.3 billion new shares, which is 9.99 percent of the company’s statutory capital.
Concerns about the continued decline in China’s economy have led to the cost of iron ore falling by about half, while coal, copper and other commodities fell in price by 20-40 percent.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
The White House on Tuesday confirmed in an official statement that China’s leader Xi Jinping will arrive with an official visit to the United States at the end of this month.
This visit - Xi Jinping's first visit to Washington - will take place on September 25 and will be a response visit to President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing in November last year, the statement said.
U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also welcome Xi Jinping and his wife, Peng Liuan, to a government dinner the same day after the two leaders hold bilateral talks.
"The visit of President Xi Jinping will give the opportunity to expand cooperation between the United States and China on general, regional and bilateral issues of interest to both sides, and will allow the US and China presidents to approach constructively the disputed issues," the statement said.
Xi Jinping, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to stop in Seattle for a meeting with leaders of several leading American tech companies on the way to Washington, D.C., and then go to New York to participate in Senegal.
Obama and Xi Jinping are expected to discuss a number of controversial issues, including Washington’s concerns about China’s alleged cyber espionage and China’s growing categorism in the disputed South China aquarium.
The killer of the biker on the Kutuzovsky Likhach received 2 years of colony.
In addition, the court partially satisfied the civil claims of the victims to Deni Mirzoev in the amount of 1.2 million rubles.
The Moscow Court of Appeals has sentenced Deni Mirzoev, who killed a motorcyclist on Kutuzovsky Avenue in Moscow.
According to the Russian News Service, Mirzoev was sentenced to two years in prison in the colony.
He is found guilty by the article "Violation of the rules of road traffic and the operation of vehicles" of the UK of the Russian Federation.
In addition, the court partially satisfied the civil claims of the victims in the amount of 1.2 million rubles.
During the debate, the prosecutor asked Mirzoev to be sentenced to three years in prison and to collect from him a full-fledged claim of eight million rubles.
The accident, which is concerned, occurred on May 22 at about three o’clock at night in the area of house 30 on Kutuzovskaya Avenue.
The BMW car, behind which Mirzoev was driving, crossed the roadway and knocked down the motorcyclist standing on the edge.
In 1989, the man was born and died on the spot.
Friends of the deceased on social media reported that the BMW driver was driving at a high speed and before the crash he went to the meeting track.
Fearing that the driver would try to escape from responsibility, the bikers organized a motor race from the Voroby Mountains to the UMVD Moscow building on Petrovka, 38.
Shortly thereafter, it became known that the investigation into the findings of the interrogation delayed the alleged perpetrator of the accident.
In Moscow, a naked man was detained in the temple.

A naked man entered the temple of St. Nicholas.
He behaved calmly and did not commit any wrongdoing.
A police team arrived at the scene on call.
The law enforcement officers waited for the doctors from the emergency psychiatric team and handed them to the man.
They were a 26-year-old resident of Moscow.
More than 40 decrees and orders were signed by Vladimir Yakushev.
More than 40 decrees and orders were signed by the governor of the Tyumen region Vladimir Yakushev at a meeting of the regional government’s presidency.
Some of them involved the allocation of funds for educational and medical institutions in the municipal educations of the area.
In particular, funds are earmarked for the acquisition of a bus for one of the schools of the Nizhny Novgorod district, for the major repair of the regional hospital in the Kazan district.
As stated in the accompanying documents, the money will go to the completion of the capital repair of the second floor of the therapeutic office.
Repair of hot and cold water supply networks, drainage, electricity grids and electrical equipment, ventilation systems, will bring to order the facade of the building, repair the premises, will carry out a complex of activities on fire safety and energy saving.
The second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi.
On September 17-18, a second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi, in which the Tamil delegation, headed by the governor, will participate.
The upcoming event in Sochi and the interim results of the cooperation are told by the Honorary Consul General of the Republic of Belarus at Tyumeni Vladimir Shugl, who was a member of the official delegation.
Vladimir Fedorovich, what are the tasks of the Sochi forum?
The large-scale event in Sochi reflects the industrial policy of the Union State.
It is built on the fruitful cooperation of the regions - important ties between the two States.
It is planned that the plenary session will be attended by President Vladimir Putin of Russia and President of the Republic of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko.
Within the framework of the plenary and sectional meetings, we will talk about the experience of the regional and local authorities of Russia and Belarus in the implementation of industrial policy, the regulatory and the programmes of the Union State.
The governor of the Tyumen region will speak at the forum.
I think this is evidence of a successful, sustainable interregional cooperation between the region and Belarus.
The forum will also be attended by representatives of profile ministries and departments, Russian and Belarusian entrepreneurs.
There will be trade fairs and specialized exhibitions, including from the Tyumen region.
I hope that the forum will help to conclude new profitable contracts and agreements.
I would add that the first such meeting took place in Minsk in June last year.
More than two hundred delegates, including from 19 regions of Russia, participated in his work.
At the same time, a very important treaty on cooperation between the Tyumen and Minsk regions was signed.
The importance of our work is also highlighted by the fact that a permanent seminar was held in Tyumen at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union of Russia and Belarus.
In addition, the delegation of the APC of the Tyumen region visited the Republic of Belarus with the aim of studying the experience of the Belarusians working in the training of staff for agriculture, identifying additional contact points and organizing new investment projects in the field of agribusiness.
You have recently met with the head of the region and the head of the city administration.
What topics were discussed?
During the meeting with the governor of the Tyumen region, Vladimir Yakushev spoke about the cooperation of the region with the Republic of Belarus in modern difficult conditions.
The issue of the supply of Belarusian agricultural machinery and the use of financial mechanisms will be affected - they are necessary to reduce the cost of machinery for the final consumer.
Problems were discussed in the work of the Tumenian trading house "Belshin" and options for preventing losses.
Issues are important, as investment projects must work clearly and bring profit to the region.
There was talk of further supplies of passenger and cargo equipment of OAO "MAZ", development of the service center of OAO "MAZ", which was created in Tyumen on the basis of OAO "TPAT".
The discussion also touched on the preparation of a visit of the working delegation of the region to the Republic of Belarus by the end of this year.
Another topic of the discussion was the conclusion of the agreement on trade, economic, scientific, technical and cultural cooperation between the Timor-Leste region and the Republic of Belarus.
Thus, the dynamics of the relationship promises to go to a new level.
These issues also concern the regional center.
During the meeting with the head of the administration of the city of Tyumen, Alexander Moor, we talked about the renewal of the Tyumen bus fleet.
About 100 buses are already "breathing on the ladder", so a new batch of Belarusian cars is required, which will work on gas, eco-friendly fuel.
Another aspect: Tyumen elevator plant cooperates with one of the leading manufacturers of elevator products of OAO "Mogilevliftmash", receiving the components.
In my view, this activity could become more active given the programmes for the installation of new lifts in the regional centre.
I will add that within the scope of the extended powers of the consul, there was a meeting with the governor of the Kurgan region Alexei Kokorin, during which the issue of increased turnover and the supply of modern Belarusian equipment in Zaurala was discussed.
A meeting with the Omsk Governor is scheduled to take place at the end of September.
The expanded consular district includes five entities of the Russian Federation, but Tumen can be called a kind of headquarters of the district.
The region is a hub for many promising projects, including the work of the Honorary Consul General.
In general, such meetings are meaningful and good in that they allow you to solve many problems directly and quickly, removing their sharpness and developing mutually beneficial cooperation.
In the current circumstances, it is extremely important not to destroy the plot, continuing to work on the prospect.

Matt Damon argued with African-American producer Effie Brown, stating behind the scenes that ethnicity is not needed to be taken into account.
During the Sunday show Project Greenlight on HBO, the famous actor interrupted Brown as she tried to emphasize the need for alternative points of view on the main black heroine in the screenplay project.
“The diversity is appropriate when you’re casting for the film itself, not for the show,” Damon insisted.
Annoyed Brown, not believing her ears, hurriedly shouted "Oh! Nothing to herself. Well" all the time while the actor from "Marcianina" was giving a live commentary.
To discuss the finalists of the show, Damon and Brown joined producer colleagues Ben Affleck and the Farelli brothers.
"I would like the participants - no matter who will be the director - to think about what interpretations of the Harmony image they are going to adhere to," Brown said at the beginning of the discussion.
The only black character is a prostitute who is beaten by a white sweater.
The film's producer, Dear White People, advocated that the film's directors be Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancacho; Damon was strongly opposed, saying "in the end we can get what we want."
After this discussion was shown on television, social networks exploded with disapproving comments to Damon.
Twitter user MrPooni was angry at what was shown in the video: "The explanation of the essence of diversity from Matt Damon to the only black person in the room is so white that it hurts so much."
Twitter has collected more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 "likes".
Damon’s statements appear just when the appropriate clarification of the racial theme in the media is the most acute issue on the agenda of the public discussion.
After a 2014 teen named Michael Brown was shot by police, the Black Lives Matter movement gained popularity across the country, urging lawmakers and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against the color population.
In February, the singer Prince mentioned the movement while presenting the nominee for the "Album of the Year" at the Grammy Awards ceremony.
“Albums still matter,” he said.
Like books and the lives of black people, albums still matter.
Recently, Black Lives Matter leaders issued an official statement in response to a Fox News employee Elizabeth Hasselbeck's question about whether the group will be regarded as a group of haters.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," the leaders of the movement said.
It was recently announced that Damon was included in the list of show business figures, producers and media magnates invited with a visit to Pope Rome to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is not known whether the actor accepted the invitation and met with the Pope.
American Ninja Warrior Awards First Champion
Professional scalper and assistant waitress Isaac Caldiero on Monday night became the first winner of the show "American Ninja Warrior", taking home a <0x24>1 million prize.
In this sporting show, the 7th season of which has just ended, none of the participants have yet managed to pass all stages of the track with obstacles.
In the final of the season, two participants - Caldeiro and operator Jeff Britten, reached the final round.
The final task included a 75-foot rope lift in 30 seconds.
Britten was the first to complete the task and settled in the given time, becoming the first athlete in the entire history of the American Ninja Warrior, going through the exhausting stage 4, but Caldeiro managed the task by just three seconds faster, which made him the winner.
After a victory that came with incredible hard work, Caldeiro, who was shocked that he had won a million dollars, gave an interview with E!News.
“It’s incredible to think about it, I’ve never made or lived for more than <0x24>10,000 a year,” Isaac told E! journalists.
And all of a sudden... I never even imagined how this would be... the future is unknown.
Executive producer Kent Wide met with The Hollywood Reporter to talk about the final and why Britten, who first crossed the track, won’t receive any cash prizes.
According to the rules, the fastest participant gets the money.
“If more than one player has finished, the prize is the fastest of them,” Wid said.
Although money is a wonderful reward and life-changing, it still gets a huge satisfaction.
I don't think he's offended about it.
He's happy with what he did.
He has received tons of enthusiastic feedback from fans.
He's a wonderful man and a family member.
He is a hero for his children and his wife.
Jeff told me, "If I was meant to lose someone, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would feel the same way if we were to change roles.
The show "America Ninja Warrior" will return with the eighth season, which will begin shooting in the spring of 2016.
The Detroit Tigers quietly bypass the Minnesota Twins.
Minneapolis – The second half of the season was not particularly fun for the Detroit Tigers.
One of the best baseball teams ever, the Tigers are now in the last place in the central division of the American League.
Claiming only to be a hindrance, the Tigers won sparkly on Tuesday at Minnesota Twins with a score of 5-4 on the Target Field.
The Twins missed a chance to cut back halfway to Houston Astros and take second place in the playoffs in the number of points after the winners.
For the Detroiters, even for one night, it was a return to the letter F, which slipped most of the second half of the season from them.
"All winnings are fun, no matter how they get," Tigers manager Brad Osmosus said.
Pitcher "Tigers" Alfredo Simon made his contribution to supporting the attacks, resulting in Detroit earning three points in the first two innings, then adding another one in the sixth and one in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) was a pitcher in 6 1/3 innings and missed three wounds.
It was only his third high-quality start in nine runs.
“I just want to end the year with good results,” Simon said.
Pitchers are not able to replace each game, and that’s why I want to go deeper into the game.
Tigers' nominee Victor Martinez managed to score three hits and scored two injuries - the first RBI since mid-August.
It was the first day with three strikes since the four strikes in the game against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He worked well with a bite," Osmus said.
He showed himself well in (the quality of the batter), significantly better in the work of the bat and kept this quality for the game.
Having scored three wounds in the second half of the seventh inning, the Twins got their best chance of returning to the game.
Central receiver Byron Baxton opened the inning with a doble on the left line of the field.
Wrightfielder Aaron Hicks, making a bant, took the first base, and the second bass player Brian Dozer got a strikeout on a kick from Simon, before his place was taken by left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy bypassed Moore, the only player on the road, the newly appointed striker Miguel Sano, who picked a double-cross single to the left of the right-handed Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of runners not in the car and a comparative injury on the second base Verhagen managed to lead the third bassman Trevor Pluff to a double-player.
This was the 27th time for the top league player this season when Pluff picked the ball for a double-player.
After Detroit added an insurance injury in the first half of the ninth inning, Moer earned RBI a "double" in the space between the outfielders against the closing pitcher "Tigers" Bruce Rondon, and the score was 5-4.
However, the right-hander picked Sano after three strikes and got his fifth shot.
Detroit took advantage of Phil Hughes, who was not temporarily practicing at the start of the game.
The Tigers earned three wounds in the first two innings against the deserved pitcher, who was on the list of injured before the game, missing more than a month due to an inflammation of the backbone.
"It's definitely not the start I'd like to start," said Hughes, "but as the game progressed, I started to feel more comfortable and therefore I was able to make a few pretty good throws in the third inning."
After the first batter reached the first base, Hughes released the single to the second bassman Yen Kinsler.
Wook at two Wrightfielder J.D. Martinez cars took out Victor Martinez, who made the single in the middle for the first wound in the game.
Victor Martinez finished his series "0 for 21" with runners in the resultant position.
The third base player, Nick Castellanos, made a single, brought another wound, but Victor Martines was beaten in an attempt to approach the third base, thus eliminating the threat.
The Tigers increased the score in the second innings, receiving a one-car "double" from James McCann's caterer and a two-car "single" from central kicker Anthony Goose, and the score went 3-0.
"It was a powerful hit," said TWINS manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit very well, but he got right to the point.
Hughes, whose shots were thought to have been thrown in a failed third inning, after which he was replaced by a right-handed relayer A.J. Achter.
Hughes was counted three wounds to six hits and a wok with four strikeouts.
NOTE: Pitcher-right "Tigers" Anibal Sánchez has left players due to right shoulder stretch.
He will be inspected by Dr. James Andrews, who performed Sánchez's shoulder surgery in 2007.
For Sanchez, who has been on the list of injured since mid-August, the launch is scheduled for Wednesday.
In the absence of Sanchez, left-leaning Daniel Norris will leave the injured list and go against the Twins.
Norris, who went out with the Tigers in four starts since his acquisition in exchange for left-winger David Price on July 30, has 1 win and 1 defeat.
He has not participated in games since August 20 due to a stretch of the hair muscle.
Tigers and Twins will complete a three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, ERA 4.43) will play right-hand pitcher Erwin Santana (5-4, ERA 4.73).
The original complaint of Kadyrov in the book "The Prayer to God" was filed in the South Sakhalin Court.
The South Sakhalin City Court filed the original appeal of the representative of the President of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov for the decision to recognize the "extremist material" of the book "Molba to God: its meaning and place in Islam," reports Interfax nadsy.
The court is now awaiting possible objections from the parties to the trial.
Chuhrai refused to comment on the statements of some deputies of the State Duma of the Russian Federation about the need to check the hordes for possible cooperation with foreign intelligence services and ISIL.
"Let yourself comment on such nonsense," he said.
On September 11, the South Sakhalin City Prosecutor’s Office filed an appeal against the decision of Judge Natalia Perchenko on the recognition of the book as “extremist material”.
The South Sakhalinska prosecutor’s office filed an appeal on Friday evening.
There are nuances: the prosecutor’s office believes that they have asked the court to acknowledge extremist opinions only of the author of this book, not of the Qur’an.
According to the prosecutor’s office, the judge made the wrong decision,” Chukhrai said.
The decision to recognize the book as "extremist material" was adopted on August 12, 2015.
In particular, the Qur'an quotes have been called "extremists" - "We worship you and ask you for help" - "Do not call anyone besides Allah."
Kadyrov called those who made the decision on the book "saints and provocators".
He called on the members of the State Duma to legally prohibit court decisions concerning the texts of the Holy Scriptures.
“I am firmly convinced that the State Duma should pass a law that prohibits judicial decisions directly related to the texts of the Koran and other Divine Scriptures,” Kadyrov wrote in his Instagram post.
Facebook to delete comments that insult migrants and refugees
Facebook employees intend to remove posts and comments that give a negative assessment to migrants and refugees.
In addition, the social network will provide financial support to organizations that collect users’ complaints about illegal content.
To combat manifestations of xenophobia and racism in the network, Facebook’s management has been found in collaboration with the German Ministry of Justice.
Earlier, the head of the department, Haiko Maas, said that the ministries are currently working together with social media specialists to create a special group of moderators.
Its participants are obliged to track and remove inaccurate comments on migrants and refugees.
According to Haiko Maasa, the authors of the intolerant posts are expected to receive notifications indicating the reason for their deletion.
Facilitating the rapid blocking of illegal content should also be facilitated by organizations whose specialists are engaged in collecting complaints from users of the social network about offensive posts.
Facebook’s management aims to provide them with the necessary financial support.
The decision to remove posts containing negative statements to migrants and refugees, the leadership of the social network and the German Ministry of Justice was taken after the rise of xenophobic moods in the German segment of Facebook.
One of the most obvious reasons for them was the unprecedented migration crisis, which covered the EU countries a while ago.
In Germany, for example, all the places for the lodging of refugees are already overcrowded.
Earlier, the authorities of the country decided to temporarily settle migrants on the territory of the former Buchenwald concentration camp.
Forced migrants from the countries of the Middle East and Africa are housed in barracks where prisoners and prisoners of war were held under the Nazi regime.
In Moscow cemeteries there will be areas for relaxation.
In the near future, several capital cemeteries will be equipped with specialized areas for relaxation and psychological rest.
Among the first will be Butov, Domodedovo, and Shcherbin Cemetery.
The first area for psychological rest has already appeared at the Troekurov cemetery in Moscow.
In the future, such areas will also appear in other areas of the city.
About this portal m24.ru told Artem Ekimov, who is the head of the state budget institution "Ritual".
Relaxation areas will represent small green areas reminiscent of parks.
According to experts, in such "angles" the visitors of the cemetery will be able to rest, be alone with themselves and restore psychological strength.
In the near future, relaxation areas will be built in the Domodedovo, Butov and Shcherbin cemeteries, and then in other areas of the capital.
According to the chapter of the GBU "Ritual", if there is a need to expand the cemetery areas, the builders will try to preserve the existing forest mass as much as possible.
The green premises will serve as a living fence, which will divide the rest areas and the areas allocated directly to the burial sites.
Experts of the Ritual GBU also stated their intention to make a proposal to refuse burials at funerals.
New cemeteries can actually become barrier-free.
In addition, GBU Ritual told about the readiness to install electronic terminals, with the help of which visitors to the cemetery will be able to identify GPS coordinates and number marks of funerals.
In June of this year, GBU Ritual also offered to adjust the cost of funeral services depending on the time of year.
Thus, the painting of the grave in the summer time will cost a thousand rubles cheaper, the weeks in winter, when the land is frozen.
In the last year, prices for all types of ritual services have increased by an average of 10 per cent.
Five days later, in the Elnin forests, a missing mushroom was found.
The elderly man was alive, although he spent more than a hundred hours in the woods without provision.
The mound was discovered thanks to the joint efforts of rescuers and volunteers.
Alexander Blinnikov, correspondent: "A 79-year-old retired from Tambov region spent five days in the forest."
Without food and water.
He was sought by relatives, rescuers, volunteers.
There were even cynologists with dogs, but there was no result.
The man was able to be found after the helicopter was connected to search jobs.
On that day, Vitali Aleksandrovich, as usual, went to the woods behind bars and berries, but did not return by evening.
The relatives immediately called for help, and the next day rescuers and indifferent residents from the neighboring village were raised in search of the fungus - only about 30 people.
On the fifth day, a fire rescue center helicopter joined them.
Andrei Seletkov, head of the search and rescue team of the Smolensk Region Fire and Rescue Center, said: "The helicopter was attracted, the man was discovered."
I went a long way, in a different place.
It was about 12 km from the search site.
He has gone a long way in his age.
The miracle survived.
The fungus was taken to the central district hospital in Elnin without consciousness, in an extremely severe condition.
Doctors diagnosed him with pneumonia, as well as severe dehydration and overcooling of the body.
As an elderly man was able to survive after five days spent in the forest, doctors do not know.
Valentina Nepsha, head of the therapeutic department of the Hellenic C.R.B.: "Patient examination, treatment is prescribed."
Infusion therapy, antibacterial.
Considering all of his chronic illnesses.
The patient’s condition improved in the morning, remains heavy, but with a positive dynamic.
Pensioner Vitaliy Aleksandrovich comes to Smolensk every year from Tambov region.
His grandson says his grandfather used to collect mushrooms, but he never went deep into the woods.
Alexei Spitchenko, the grandson of the found mushroom, shared: "The forest is not far from the road, in principle not local."
Literally for several years he came to visit, to host relatives.
Well, he went for mushrooms.
Apparently he went a long way and got lost.
With the start of the mushroom season, people are regularly lost in all areas of the Smolensk region.
Only in the last few days have there been five similar cases.
Rescuers remind: in the forest you need to walk in bright clothes, with a small supply of food, spikes and compass.
In addition, it is advisable to leave traces behind so that you can then go back.
An emergency An-2 sat on average in the brotherly taiga.
An emergency An-2 landed on average in Siberia.
An emergency landing aircraft of the Krasnoyarsk airline "Enisei" carried out in 68 kilometers from Bratsk.
There were no casualties and injuries, but the plane itself suffered significant damage when landing.
An-2 has made an official flight.
There were three crew members on board – a commander, a second pilot and a boat mechanic, Interfax reported.
The emergency aircraft made a flight on the route Zeleznogorsk-Ilimsky - Akhinsk, where the airline is based.
The crew of the plane has already been delivered to Bratislava.
The Brother Transportation Prosecutor's Office after the emergency landing of the An-2 began to verify compliance with the legislation on flight safety.
The East Siberian Transport Prosecutor’s Office was on the scene.
In September 2010, the crew of the Tu-154 boarded their plane with passengers due to a technical failure at the abandoned Tajik airport in Komi.
Engines and onboard electronics were denied on the ship, but the crew made it impossible.
On board the plane were 10 crew members and 72 passengers.
No one was injured during the emergency landing of the plane.
News Economics <0xE2><0x80><0x95> Nobel Prize laureate: globalization
The globalization processes should have contributed to the reduction of inequality in the world.
In fact, the situation looks different, the difference in the income of the population in developing economies, on the contrary, is growing.
Eric Maskin.
To correct this, it is necessary to improve the level of education of low-skilled workers, according to Eric Maskin, Senior Research Officer of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Choice of Solutions of the University’s NIU, winner of the 2007 Nobel Prize in Economics.
Over the past 20 years, the world has experienced an unprecedented growth in global markets.
The trade borders between the countries are becoming more and more open.
Proponents of globalization have predicted major benefits for emerging economies.
"And these predictions have come true in a lot," Maskin stresses.
For example, China and India have experienced a significant per capita GDP growth.
However, not everything is so jealous.
Globalization was expected to reduce the gap between the “poor” and the “poor” in poor countries, which is manifested in large income inequality, more precisely – wages.
But in fact, this inequality has only increased, notes Eric Maskin in his article "Why global markets have not reduced inequality in developing economies", published in The World Bank Economic Review, which was translated and quoted by the U.S. Embassy.
Together with an economist, Professor Michael Kremer of Harvard University Eric Maskin has developed an alternative theory that demonstrates why income disparity in poor countries is increasing as globalization grows.
Specific processes are taking place in the new global market.
In order to demonstrate them, Maskin allocates four skill levels of specialists - A and B for rich countries, C and D - for poor.
After globalization, D specialists from poor countries lack the level of qualifications to cooperate with A and B specialists from rich countries.
And if C-level workers from poor countries have wage increases thanks to cooperation with B-level employees from the rich, then D-level workers do not feel growth or their wages fall at all.
The final effect is that internationalization of production will contribute to an increase in the pay gap between the two categories of professionals in poor countries and, consequently, to an increase in inequality.
Kremer and E. Maskin have proposed an astonishingly beautiful model, an alternative Ricardian theory of comparative advantages.
It explains why globalization has led to income inequality,” says Fuad Alekserov, an ordinary professor, head of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Decision Selection, head of the Department of Mathematics of the University of Applied Sciences.
And like any powerful theory, I am sure it will lead to an explosion of empirical work in this field.
The solution to the problem, according to Erik Maskin, is to increase the level of education of low-skilled workers.
However, as the scientist notes, employees themselves do not have the means to do so, and companies do not pay for their training.
In such a situation, governments, international agencies, NGOs and private funds can play a significant role, Maskin said.
The scientist notes that the theory developed does not in any way call for an end to the globalization process that has produced and bears fruit in the form of GDP growth in countries.
Derbent: living connection of time.
Derbent - one of the oldest cities in Russia - celebrates its 2000th anniversary in September.
In the program of festive events - the festival of national cultures of the peoples of Dagestan and a fair in the style of the past, the exhibition of derbent carpets and the Day of the Open Temples, the historical and musical show "2000 years in two hours" and excursions to the reconstructed I Petr museum.
Medieval stones of Narin-Kala fortress, ancient Arab inscriptions on the walls, narrow streets and palace gardens - all as if they came from the pages of "Thousands and One Night".
Derbent is the only city in Russia that has remained in its place since ancient times.
Although it was claimed by the Roman Empire, Byzantine Empire, the Khazarian Caganate and the Golden Order.
The age of the Eastern Platanes, which grow in the courtyard of the Derbent Juma Mosque, is equal to several centuries.
These powerful plants are under the protection of the All-Russian program "Trees - Monuments to Living Nature".
The shadow of the broken crowns saves pilgrims and tourists during the summer heat.
Visitors to the mosques will enjoy aromatic tea and will be greeted with Dagestan delicacies - honey inger, horn, mushroom, wonder stickers, ayran and sweets.
During the centuries, Derbent has used large samovars to drink tea from numerous guests at once.
The inscription above the entrance to the Juma Mosque says that the building was built in 115 A.D. Hijra.
In 733, according to the Gregorian calendar.
It is the oldest mosque in Russia.
The interior is astounded by the scale and solemnity: the arcades of domes and constellations are based on square columns and are illuminated by the rays of the sun from the tiny windows.
The content and breeding of pigeons is a traditional passion of the inhabitants of Derbent.
The owners of the housebirds put pigeons in the courtyards, under trees, on the floors.
An exciting spectacle is the ascent into the sky of a room of white pigeons, similar to the flashes of a holiday firework.
In defense of the enemy, the ancient Persians covered the Caspian gates with a double stone wall.
Going 500 meters into the sea, this building closed the port of Derbenta.
In 2003, Derbent’s fortress walls were included in the UNESCO World Heritage List as the most well-preserved monument to the ancient Persian fortification.
The carpets in Derbent were woven in the 5th century, and to this day the technology of this unique craft has remained almost unchanged.
On one of the streets adjacent to the city market, carpets are sold for any taste - bars of wool, cotton or wool of all colors and shades, with furs and without it, with a complex ornament and a strange chimney.
The construction of the city began with magalov - districts with one-storey stone buildings.
Over the years, the tide has barely changed.
Only satellite plates, air conditioners on the walls and street lights remind you that you are not in the Middle Ages, but in the modern city.
In the old part of the city, the details of the water pipeline built by the Persians about a thousand years ago were preserved.
To this day, ancient springs have come, in which the locals still collect water.
Many derbists prefer ordinary water from taps to water from proven historical fountains.
Durbent was one of the centers of mining.
Liquid and painted vases, dishes, bowls, cups were valued throughout the Caucasus.
The hands of the competitors are now making wonderful ceramic products for both practical and commemorative purposes.
On the days of the holidays and festivals, the crowd of spectators gather under a stretched cane, at which the students of the Republican School of Circus Art perform.
The history of amazing and risky craftsmanship is several centuries old.
A new tendency is to see girls more and more often among canoes.
In the room of the former Virgin Bath today operates the Museum "Culture and Life of the Ancient Derbent".
Previously, unmarried girls and brides were washed here in the company of friends, and now anyone who wishes can see a converged dome hall, hot and cold swimming pools, going into the past bathing accessories.
Most of Derbent’s homes have hot water, but baths and steamers are as popular today as they used to be.
The benefits of warming the body by steam are written in ancient books.
After the bath, the blood improves, the muscles lose fatigue, the body acquires flexibility and lightness.
The "Sofizity" festival, which takes place on the territory of the Narin-Kala fortress, is attended by the ethnic court of many districts of Dagestan.
Participants in national costumes dance, play folk melodies, perform songs of the peoples of the Caucasus and treat visitors with delicious homemade cheese.
Kirkhlar is the burial place of forty martyrs who set their heads for Islam.
It is one of the most revered complexes for Muslims in the North Caucasus.
From time to time, sarcophagus are cut from whole stone blocks and are oriented, as is common among Arabs, on the west-east axis.
The brothers Gavril and Albert Yakubova cut and break customers in a small salon near the Upper Market.
The hairdresser has been in this place for many years.
Receipts of circular craft are passed on from generation to generation.
At the same time, Yakubova brothers can make not only the traditional, but also the most modern hairstyle.
On one of the streets of the Old City was preserved a house in which the decabrist writer Alexander Bestujev-Marlinsky lived.
Learning the Turkish language and collecting ethnographic material, he described Derbent in the first third of the 19th century with his ancient monuments, life and life of citizens.
Tsaihana is a traditional East club where only tea and homemade baking are served.
Men come here to suffocate the thirst, talk to friends and solve some working problems.
As in the past, women are not recommended to cross the teapot threshold.
Derbent's dance ensemble "Caspiy" was created three years ago, but has already managed to participate in events at the Republican and Russian level.
The soloists of the ensemble rehearse every day, teaching in perfection folk Avar, Darghin, Tata, Armenian dances.
With the advent of the evening, when the noise goes off and the streetlights go on, locals sit on benches near houses with terraces.
As a rule, derbys are discussing household issues.
But in the eve of the jubilee, they increasingly remember episodes of the unique history of their city, affecting the fate of the entire Black Sea-Caspian region.
In Domodedovo there was a business "play at the airport".
There is a new form of learning in the capital.
Four hundred students have tried themselves in the role of airport staff.
To do this, Domodedova mounted the models of three aircraft carriers.
The young people not only watched and registered the passengers, but also serviced the aircraft.
All this is in the form of a business game, but in terms of complexity it did not yield to reality.
Late flights, two passengers with fractures on board, the trap was lost somewhere on the way to the plane.
The real airport is hell.
For that which was established in the Domodedova hangar - a standard set of tasks, which is to be solved by beginners.
In one hangar, three major airports from different countries of the world were accommodated at once.
Today, they employ four hundred students from the capital’s colleges and universities.
An unprecedented opportunity to learn all about the internal world of aviation.
Passenger registration, airplane service, luggage traffic - they were entrusted even by buses at the airfield, staircases and passenger inspection.
Passengers are very problematic.
In one of the mess with the documents, the other was late for the flight, the third filled the bag with suspicious items.
And you need to deal with all of this, as in life - in a minimum of time.
For each of these tasks, they are charged a certain amount, virtual cash, as if the airline had paid them the corresponding amounts for the flight service.
"For not performing the relevant tasks, they are fined," - explains in the interview program "News-Moscow" Dmitry Hilko, financial analyst of the game.
What is happening is closely monitored by officials from the Ministry of Education.
For them, this exam is an attempt to try a new form of learning.
She has already been given a place in secondary vocational education.
"Six inter-regional centres of competence will be formed, which will essentially become new models of activities of modern colleges with a modern management system, with highly qualified staff, with modern equipment," - the director of the department of state policy in the field of preparations, - Napollo Napollo of the materials of the materials.
But the students are not to the global plans.
After three days of training, they seem to need a weekend off.
However, the assessments for this exam had quite a material expression.
The newest smart glasses, the best I've ever seen!
"I got them for responding in time to our complaint to the airport on Instagram," - pleased the participant of the game, the team manager of the Frankfurt Airport, Sergei Shuvalov.
The best judges, so-called, were put on a pencil to invite them to work by the time they finished their studies.
The U.S. Embassy regrets the closure of the American Center in Moscow.
The U.S. Embassy in Russia expressed regret over the closure of the Library of Foreign Literature of the U.S. Center.
The center has been working in Moscow for more than 22 years.
The U.S. Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the unilateral decision of the Russian government to close the U.S. Embassy Center at the All-Russian State Library M.I. Rudomino in Moscow.
“The unilateral steps taken recently by the Russian Federation question the commitment of the Russian government to the ties between the Russian and American peoples, which were not interrupted even during the Cold War and in other difficult moments of the U.S. history,” she said.
The American Center has established deep and strong links between the people and the culture of Russia and the United States.
It was the center of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital, and also served as a venue for meetings with numerous American prominent figures, including astronauts, artists, athletes, scientists, politicians and writers.
“Only last year, the American Center held more than 400 cultural and educational events and welcomed more than 50,000 Russian visitors,” the diplomat said.
Tefft recalled that about a year ago it was decided to close another joint Russian-American project - the FLEX (Future Leaders Exchange Program).
The Green Court was a ambulance for the trial.
Typical situation: Four officials stand at the table of Judge Svatante Kumar, hearing his claims to the work done.
The court is completely dissatisfied with the quality of your work.
We didn’t give you a 110-page order so that you might be upset about it,” Kumar said.
If at least one more brick is laid, we will order to remove all the existing buildings.
Kumar is headed by the National Green Tribunal (NRT), a judiciary body established in 2010 to stop the rapid pollution of the environment that accompanies the turbulent economic growth of recent decades.
During this time, the Tribunal has been able to consider more than 10,000 complaints related to air pollution, garbage collection, geological development, toxic waste and construction of dams.
In two out of three cases, the court decides to stop the construction leading to pollution.
Incredibly high rates: in the less than 60 years since the proclamation of the independence of the strengthened industrial development, India has become one of the most overpopulated and polluted countries in the world.
The problem is particularly acute in large metropolitan areas, where the development of the infrastructure does not go beyond rapid urbanization: the cities are covered with dense smog, the rivers are filled with pesticides and waste from farms and households.
Despite the formal support of the green movement by the state, the NZT is regularly criticized by the Narendra Modi government, as it often becomes the main reason for the cancellation of major investment projects.
In May of this year, the Minister of the Environment called the court’s decisions “extreme” and “unenforceable”.
Sometimes it is really impossible to execute the court’s judgments within the time limit set by the court, confirms environmental lawyer Raj Panjwani.
However, non-executable dedlines also have a positive side: at least, they force the responsible to move.
“His main goal is to overturn this system,” adds the lawyer.
The Green Tribunal has cancelled large buildings several times: for its sake, the construction of the airport, power plant and hundreds of smaller structures has been stopped.
At the same time, people also try not to forget: for example, during the discussion of the fate of a pharmaceutical company in Telagnan, which polluted the local river with fluoride.
We can close your factory, but we are also responsible for the economic consequences.
“People will lose their jobs,” Kumar said.
However, such explanations are not always understood by ordinary people, whose lives can change thanks to one slice of the judicial feather.
For example, in April, the Tribunal decided to ban all vehicles over 10 years of age from entering the capital, which provoked public outrage.
Despite a sharp decline in popularity and a stir of criticism, Swataner Kumar refused to cancel this decision.
Instead, he ordered statistics on incoming and outgoing carriages from the government of Delhi, and offered to buy 10,000 additional buses in advance at factories, as well as whether they were able to fulfill such an order.
As sources of pollution such as landfills, fuel quality and even road accidents began to fall into the court’s attention, people’s anger began to calm down a bit.
But the most sick theme of the principle judge was the Gang River purification program, with a pump announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year.
When it comes to Ganges, a river sacred to the Hindus, the judge often stops restraining his emotions and goes on to scream.
Do you know what the word "holy" means?
Someone poured water from the Ganges into the statue of God, and there were fecals in it, the judge will warm up.
You continue to pollute the river because you think: Gang is Gang, it will take away all our sins.
This is the river we worship, and see what you do with it every day.
Cleaning Ganges is the most ambitious and costly environmental project announced by the new government.
Currently, the number of fecal bacteria in this river exceeds the norm more than 120 times.
Each year, 1.5 to 3 out of 700 million bathing Hindus die from infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even donated money to the Gang's Rescue Fund from the sale of his suit, in which he met Barack Obama and another 455 items from his personal collection.
Ecologists immediately accused the prime minister of populism: the suit was bought for <0x24>700,000, while it takes at least eight billion to clean up the river.
Proponents of the Green Tribunal agree that India is still a long way to go before it can call itself a developed country, but they do not believe that the price of progress should be ecology.
“In a developing country, environmental talks are often perceived as an unauthorized luxury,” said Zov Ganga activist Malika Bhanot.
And the court is trying to find a golden middle between ecology and development.”

Xi Jinping urges to make the economy more open to the world
The economy needs to be more open to the world to boost its growth, as President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday in his address to the group facing the challenge of leading reforms.
"China should focus on attracting foreign investors and experts and develop a policy of openness," he said, addressing the 16th meeting of the Central Leading Group Committee on Comprehensive Deepening Reforms.
In his words, expanding openness and deepening reforms will give the economy a new impetus and vitality and provide a new space for economic development.
The Leading Group adopted a number of directives, including on the introduction of market access regulation for investors, the change in border control rules, the promotion of public enterprises (SOE) attracting private capital and the revision of the registration system of residents.
According to the statement, a list of sectors of the economy and production that are not available for investment will be drawn up.
The system will be gradually deployed through trial programs.
This is an important step as it will provide the market with a more significant role in the allocation of resources, ensuring business legitimacy and increasing transparency, as stated in the statement.
The government will also weaken control of the powers conferred on companies, ensuring that the companies will run their own business.
The statement also said that China would allow border regions to master new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to boost local growth.
More areas will be available to private investors in order to increase the openness of state-controlled sectors of the economy.
“The government will not change its policy towards foreign investors and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies, as well as provide them with better conditions,” the statement said.
In addition, the procedure for applying for a permanent residence permit for foreigners, or “green card”, will be facilitated by optimizing the requirements and simplifying the application process itself.
The meeting also discussed the rights of lawyers and the training of professional judges and prosecutors.
According to the official report issued after the meeting, Prime Minister Li Katian and Ministers Liu Yunshaan and Zhang Gaoli were also present.
