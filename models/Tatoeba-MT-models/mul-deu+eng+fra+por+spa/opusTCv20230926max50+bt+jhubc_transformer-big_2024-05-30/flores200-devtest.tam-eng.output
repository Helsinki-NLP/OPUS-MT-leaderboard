The Vehicle Direction is a study of the movement of vehicles and of the individual drivers and of the interconnection between the two points.
Fortunately, it is a little harder to study the traffic flow because one (1) hundred per cent of the behaviour of the drivers cannot be calculated with certainty.
Fortunately, drivers show the tendency to drive vehicles within a fair range of limits; hence, traffic has a fair stability, and they are referred to as mathematical rationality.
In order to better represent the traffic congestion, the relationships have been established between three main factors: (1) the congestion, (2) the congestion and (3) the speed.
