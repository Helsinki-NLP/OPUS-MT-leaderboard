Parliament does not support the novel Liberating Tymoshenko
Ukraine's parliament today rejected the proposal to repeal the paragraph under the novel criminal code, on the basis of which the opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko was convicted.
The amendment, which would pave the way for the release of the imprisoned prime minister, was rejected by MEPs at the second reading of the proposal to alleviate penalties for economic crimes.
Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October for concluding an allegedly unfavorable contract with Russia to buy natural gas.
The judgment is not valid, the appeal of the convicted is to be discussed by the court in December.
Tymoshenkova refers to the ruling as the political vengeance of the regime, the suspicion of involvement of the court has triggered the trial in the West.
The proposal to exclude paragraph 365 of the Criminal Code, on the basis of which the prime minister was sentenced, supported 147 MEPs in the vote.
It took 226 votes to approve it.
Category: Libyan victories
The story of the liberation of Libya, or the Libyan rebel, has its defeated.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and is without him after the war.
We have to define the winner.
As is the custom in the region, the Islamists win the election, but it is whether moderate or radical.
The Transitional National Council has applied to the customary law of Sharia and we already have a certain idea of it.
Libya will become a country without crime, because theft is a hand cut off.
Women may forget emancipation, any apostates from the faith await execution and so on.
Instead of being a dictator, a society consisting of rival tribes will unite the Koran.
There will be an order in Libya that we cannot imagine and that we would certainly not want.
But our way of life is not the only one, nor objectively the best, and it would probably not be suitable for change, for example, for the Libyans just mentioned.
In fact, it’s surprising that Islamic warriors have taken thanks with the help of unfaithful dogs.
The only excuse is that, from their point of view, it was not NATO’s attack by any U.S. general, but by Allah, the size of whom they celebrated at every such intervention.
So when the Libyans are looking for the winners, the West is not among them.
We took part in shootings, served Islam, and our politicians, in the person of a dictator, got rid of a political ally without guaranteeing any profit.
After recent bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not militaryly occupy Libya.
In this case, there is a problem with the expulsion of "cruisers".
But will they have a oil company behind the Libyan black gold bubble without the occupation?
They may not be enough, and the West will finally be able to boast of the unscrupulous protection of human rights.
Unless the Shari'ah's law-believers tell us that.
A new era of crisis is beginning.
France and the rest of Europe are on the lookout for investors
Statistical slump has crossed Europe on Tuesday.
Individual countries have published data on GDP for 3Q.
The Czech economy has stagnated between quarters, Germany and France are growing.
The stock market is breaking records today.
Investors are no longer just looking at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
Statistical offices of the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries have published preliminary estimates of the economic development in the third quarter.
Germany’s GDP increased by 0.5%, France by 0.4%.
At the same time, the two countries adjusted the data for the second quarter, in which Germany side by side better than expected (increase by 0.3% instead of the original 0.1%), so France said it appeared in a slight drop of 0.1% (original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% interannually in the third quarter of this year.
However, in the quarter, gross domestic product (GDP) stagnated and the trend of gradual slowing growth in economic performance was confirmed according to <0xC4><0x8C>S<0xC3><0x9A>.
The results are worse than the analysts’ estimates.
The Most Important Events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent interannually in the third quarter of this year, but stagnated in the quarter.
The German economy grew by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter, according to preliminary and seasonally recalculated data.
The eurozone and the European Union's economy grew by 0.2 per cent between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which is in line with analysts' expectations.
The Greek economy declined by 5.2 per cent year-on-year.
Income on its 10-year bonds is 28.45%.
Income from Italian and Spanish bonds is rising to critical limits.
The problems are beginning to feel in Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc...
Income from Czech 10-year bonds remains below 4%, even though the situation in the region is deteriorating.
There are voices from Germany that the ECB should be the creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for the Euro.
In Montenegro, they won 1-0 and celebrate the process for 200 million
The football team has managed the most difficult task of the season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the great Czech and beautiful Branch Petra Jira<0xC4><0x8D>ka won 1:0.
Czech football, even with a lot of luck in the second half, won a luxurious jump from home revenge and again will not be missing in the European championship.
IHNED.cz followed the progressions in detailed reports.
Almost no excitement in the first half and a big portion of happiness in the second.
The Czech national team, thanks to their home match, great Czech and hero Jira<0xC4><0x8D>ka, won in Montenegro happily 1-0 and is celebrating the European Championship.
Due to the precise defense of the Czechs as a whole, the Blacks were under pressure in the second half.
The fighters became Damjanovi<0xC4><0x8D> and Vu<0xC4><0x8D>ini<0xC4><0x87>, who burned two great chances.
Even thanks to the great Peter <0xC4><0x8C>ech, the Czech team will not miss the European Championship next year, and the national football cashier will receive a reward of about 200 million kroner.
There has been a lot of fighting football since the beginning of the game.
Both teams struggled to get involved in the combination and played mostly around the half-line.
This is why the pressure of the domestic footballers did not come in the first half, because the Czech defense was precisely distracted by the lengthy purchases for defense.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They created a living shield.
Several hundred graduates have created a live shield around a nuclear facility in Iran.
With their gesture, they want to express their support for their country’s nuclear program before a possible Israeli attack.
Students prayed in front of the building on Tuesday afternoon and then protested the deaths of the United States and Israel.
Several hundred students from universities in Isfahan, Iran, created a live shield around the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Center, where uranium is processed.
They make it clear that they are ready to defend their country’s nuclear program with their own lives.
In a recent report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) noted that Iran did not seem to stop seeking nuclear weapons.
A possible attack on Iran’s nuclear facility is being discussed in Israel.
Students prayed at noon before entering the Isfahan nuclear facility and then celebrated the deaths of America and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at protecting Iran’s nuclear program as much as possible, according to the Israeli press, a facility in Natanz that enriches uranium would also be targeted in addition to the Isfahan Center.
Dining table for an obese child: not breakfast and dinner nuts
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have problems with overweight, with 9% of schoolchildren and 5% of obese children.
Obese children come from families with an unhealthy lifestyle, according to a recent survey.
Again, it shows how important it is for the healthy development of the human environment in which it grows, and the patterns in which it is surrounded.
For example, on the tables of obese children, stools appear up to half as often as in the families of children with normal weight.
The fried potatoes had for dinner the day before the research related to a lighting event called Obesity is not a coincidence more than 19 percent of obese.
There is also no habit of sporting in thickets families, which, however, affects most of today’s schoolchildren’s families – only 15 percent of children answered that their parents would find time to actively move at least once a week.
A survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of last school year and attended at least 900 children from primary schools from all over the Czech Republic.
It was already the second year of the Obesity is not a coincidence that is supported by the General Health Insurance Company and Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 students from 4th to 8th grades have participated in the project.
Proper eating and enough exercise in the family is one of the determining factors that causes a dramatic increase in the number of children overweight or even obese.
“Only half of the respondents, for example, stated that they received five times a day in the breakfast-snack-snack-snack-dinner regime, which is one of the basic prerequisites for proper nutrition,” one of the results of the survey said.
No breakfast and no dinner for us
Experts note that for healthy development, there are also important and relative details, including, for example, the regular time of family breakfast.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of schoolchildren eat breakfast at the same time.
In most families, everyone eats breakfast on their own.
And the worst thing was the fact that in a dozen households don’t have breakfast at all.
Breakfast is the basis of a proper daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that in families with obese children, unhealthy potatoes are much more often consumed.
Almost everyone – regardless of weight – drinks sweet lemonade every day (70 percent).
Although more than 40 percent of the children surveyed regularly exercised, the result was less than half - 15 percent for their parents.
Set up your own Dining Room
The next part of the survey enabled the selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to make their own dining options according to their own taste and opinion.
"The nutritional preferences of Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15 are far from ideal in terms of healthy nutrition."
Among their favorite dishes are a lot of dairy, savory and sweet dishes.
“It’s especially alarming to have a huge taste for sweet lemonade,” the study’s final report said.
For lunch as the main meal, pasta was won just above the poultry.
However, children practically didn’t want to eat chickpeas at all, and the taste of fish and lunch vegetables is low.
Approach to Health
At the same time, the survey showed that children are willing to adjust their eating habits if they get the right information.
“In the control group of respondents who completed a questionnaire after the completion of the Obesity Lighting Lecture, there was no accident, in a number of cases a significant shift of preferences towards healthy nutrition principles,” the results of the project said.
This was notable, for example, for sweet lemonades, where more children would begin to prefer ordinary water.
Children also more often highlighted poultry and fish as the main meal of the day in the questionnaire and would limit sweet foods and toasts.
A stylist must also be a good psychologist, say professionals
In the introductory article about how to learn stylists, I was so late that it was already a lot in the introductory hours.
I didn't know what was going to happen next.
Lectures of three professionals in the field, dressing up problematic characters and a seminar on how it goes to the place.
And it'll get worse.
The closer to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it's really "scratched".
This time, Director Alenka and I discussed (there is no boy in the course) how to dress up a woman who does not have a perfectly proportional figure.
And so is the overwhelming majority.
Someone has a short neck, someone has a boyish figure without proper curves, and someone is overweight.
A stylist needs to know how to optically soften the broad shoulders, lengthen the neck or add the necessary curves.
We have received tips such as for a woman like Jennifer Lopez, i.e. larger breasts and sides and a narrow waistband, to emphasize the character nicely and at the same time not to dress a woman too invitingly.
For example, if the difference between the waist and the sides is such that the skirts or pants really don’t fit, then it’s worth making at least one of those pieces tailor-made.
You will definitely not regret it, because perfectly falling clothes are unpaid.
In a tailor-made skirt you will feel much better than in one that constantly moves you, pulls you up, stays in the waist and the like.
The boy’s character, in turn, can afford to wear clothes with scissors, apps, embroidery or picking.
Of course, there are many such information and types of characters, so I’m glad to have a whole week to put all the information in my head.
And I'm also afraid that due to the assignment of homework, it's not enough.
In fact, each of the Kurds received an assigned celebrity, who is supposed to invent two outfits: the day and the evening.
We must take into account the current look, the fashion style of the given personality and the type of character.
I'm going to "dress" Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
In the spirit of the yokes, for me personally definitely better than such Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who has recently gained about a hundred pounds (please consider the excess) or young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut clothes out of magazines or search the internet and print and then graphically process.
Moodboard, as the whole result is called, will also express our personal style and relationship to graphics.
Thinking about the graphic side of styling is also important.
The stylist does not only dress physically, but also creates so-called product pages in magazines (for a specific assignment, for example, trends in handbags, coats, etc.).
This was told by stylist and designer Mario Kameník.
But it's not until Sunday.
A stylist must have a general overview
Three guests from the field immediately improved the Saturday lecture loaded with information on the types of characters.
Stylist Honza Pomorny, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Ren<0xC4><0x8D>.
Jacob reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist should be able to take advantage of it.
And a stylist can work with one piece of clothing differently.
Variability is key in this case.
So, for example, such a trench (or if you originally wanted a trenchcoat) can be worn classically through jeans and t-shirts as a coat, but you can also wear it on a naked body, tie the boats and paint it as a dress.
Or just pull out sleeves or collars and immediately the whole look looks different.
"Play with it," he stressed.
Most of all, I appreciated the advice: "You need to know the rules perfectly for work."
"Then you can start breaking them," Jakub said.
Finally, I understand why we're breaking all those lessons, what to combine with, why, why, when we see something different in the fashion magazines of leckdy.
Not to mention the overviews.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I know that the stylist must have prepared a lot more clothing options than the number of them he is going to take.
So in the fashion story, which will have ten sides (i.e. ten outfits), I have to be ready to "set up" at least fifteen.
And also that on the photo the clothing looks and works in combination with other pieces of leckdy completely different than in fact.
So we have to count on that when creating an outfit.
That the image and style make leaks up to half of the success, Honza Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD> confirmed us.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly a wonderful singer, but the image and marketing made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to using the services of stylists is rather cool.
Even familiar faces consider her leaks to be unnecessary (it is enough that I know something, what I look like in it is secondary).
And if someone already lets us create a styling, then we have to count on it being highly likely that it dictates us a completely different (smaller) size than it really is.
Then there is nothing left but to google and find out if the boulevard didn’t say that the celebrity fell/lost and the like.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario reminded us that the stylist is not enough to orient himself in fashion and be able to lay outfits.
In his work, he primarily communicates with the people he dresses, so it is important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to estimate people, not to be inviting, to stand up for your opinion.
"If you're asked by a manager to change her wardrobe and add nice pieces to it, you can't throw out the whole wardrobe and say, 'Oh, my God, that's awful.'
"Find at least a few things that you'll praise and recommend for what they can wear," says Mario.
He also showed us specifically what everything must contain the so-called "wallet", or bag on the plate.
It’s the one that you lock around the waist and you have all the necessary properties with you.
In addition to clear things such as knives, hair rollers or closure buckles, there is also a silo thread (with it the stylist helps in photographing products such as bags or hats), special clips, which we sew on the back of the clothes, if the stitches are larger or larger.
In order not only to listen, but also to practically try something, we learned how to stick the shoes properly.
Even when shooting in an atelier, where there is a flat surface, the underwear could be damaged, as well as outside.
And so we glued and glued.
We must not even touch the boots with knives so that they are not damaged by accident.
So, we really need skill.
Mario was pleased when my work was complimented without reservation.
This skill isn’t really my friend.
This is just a small fraction of what we heard about the second weekend of the course.
It is becoming increasingly clear to me that styling at a professional level is not really a walk through a pink tree, no matter who wants to say what they want.
In Need for Speed: The Run will be racing all over America.
Revisions
Originally a carefree ride, due to a series of completely unnecessary old-fashioned errors, turns into a routine morning ride on the road.
Although the ambition has largely succeeded in fulfilling it, it is not valid if no one apparently wanted to do anything more.
The new subtitled The Run awakened high expectations before the release.
He promised that the flight of the Need for Speed series would move a bit in a new direction again, and from the playable demonstrations it appeared as a game that in the action race genre would not have to be just count.
We were also curious as to how the inserted passages will arrive, in which the main character will get out of the car and take place on their own.
As with the NFS series, however, many are a little different from what we expected.
These are potentially decent arcade races, but the whole draws down a few unnecessary bugs that appear in the series for at least several years.
So it's not actually a mistake, but rather a manifestation of some incomprehensible laziness of the developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are told in a story whose main character Jack has certain personal problems and as a solution is offered to participate in an illegal race across America.
You will be driving on the west coast of San Francisco and your task is to arrive first in New York.
The idea brings with it a number of interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages, and then further into more than fifty races.
It follows that each race goes on a different track and the stages are planted in different, quite different and interesting environments.
You don’t have the feeling that the game is always the same.
In addition, some of the environments are very nice to see, although the technical level of the graphics matches the previous parts of the series.
So it's not a world-class thing.
But driving through the desert, autumn landscape or high in snowy mountains is visually very pleasant.
In addition, races are occasionally hampered by some unusual element.
In the desert, for example, you get caught up in a sandstorm, which significantly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains, you need to be careful not to fall asleep by the avalanche.
In addition, there are quite a few races behind each other.
There are only a few types, but that's enough.
For a while you try to get ahead of the required number of opponents (essentially a classic race), then you take back time (classic fight with sticks) and then you have a duel with a single opponent.
From time to time, you will also join the police, which further displeases your efforts.
The news is that there are passengers out of the car.
Rather, it’s just an interactive animation where Jack usually runs away from someone and you have to help him by pressing the right buttons at the right moments.
There's nothing complicated.
Surprisingly, however, these passages are much less in play than you would expect (especially maybe only three).
As a result, however, it is to the benefit of the thing, because this element has no chance of becoming annoying and in the context of the above, it thus ranks among the elements that promote the game.
The driving model follows in the footsteps of the previous parts.
This means that it’s definitely no longer a who, but it can’t be said to be a contradiction.
If you are looking for a realistic simulation, you will have to look elsewhere.
But the more actively understood race, the driving model here is still quite well suited, even though we would be able to find better in the competition.
Until then, everything is in perfect order.
Problems, however, begin to emerge after a while.
Unlike the driving model, the model is no longer very good.
From this type of game we don't expect it to count complex deformations and collisions, but if you don't have the slightest idea of how your car will behave before virtually any impact on any object, then probably not everything is perfectly fine.
Typically, when you pass by or pass by cars in normal traffic, sometimes you just sneeze slightly with each other, but sometimes in the almost identical situation, your car will end up in wild pirouettes.
Or even a direct attack.
Thanks to the restart system, it doesn’t really matter, but it will make you feel comfortable.
The restarts are solved so that if you skip or go far beyond the track, the game will put you back at the last catch point on the track.
However, there are only five reboots available in each race.
When you exhaust them, you have to restart the race from the beginning.
So it’s more of a help in case something doesn’t happen than you can expressly rely on it.
Sometimes, however, even the restarts will not help, they will solve the need to learn a particular part of the race of memory.
The big drawback of the game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some turns, for example, require a project in a specific way, otherwise you will not fall short of them.
At other times, you will always encounter "civil" cars in the same configuration, whether you arrive first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
Angry especially in situations where you see the opponent running easily between the two opposite cars in front of you, while when you get there, the cars are already in such a position that you have to circumvent or brake them.
It doesn’t matter when you get to them, because it’s “calculated” so that the situation always happens right in front of your nose.
Competitors have another advantage.
Throughout the game, you will encounter several places where, again, no matter the time, the same opponent always precedes you in the same place.
Most of all, it stalls at the end of the game on a long bridge where you go in the opposite direction.
The opponent must be there before you, apparently, at any cost.
When it goes in front of you, it deteriorates your perception of the anti-passenger cars, so at first, you’ll probably get a little bit more diverse.
You can understand the intention to make the game more tense and adrenaline, but the implementation is so obvious that it will reliably dislike you quickly.
And it's a shame, because despite the simple driving model, playing places is fun and even so actionful that sometimes you literally don't want to watch where it's flying.
And basically it doesn’t matter if it deserves a concept with fifty unique tracks, ranking races so that boredom doesn’t have a chance, or anything else.
An unconventional idea is to change cars during races.
You need to pay attention to gasoline pumps on the road, because it’s where you can change the car, although in most cases you’ll be enough with what you have.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Athletes are suitable for urban areas, strong U.S. buses on straight roads and exotic supersports on technical rides, for example after clicked mountain trips.
The main story mode goes hand in hand with the challenge modes, which are races in the individual locations you know from the story.
Here you get not only medals, but also experience points in your profile, which is common to challenges and story.
In order to get a higher level of the driver, different objects are unlocked: starting with cars and ending with backgrounds for the profile.
At the same time, it is again linked to the online Autolog feature, which compares your results with other players and acquires additional community features.
Another hard-to-understand digger is the situation of the last race in the story.
With your car you will get to the subway tunnel (budzh), where you will find it in the dark by the tracks (budzh).
On the tachometer you flash numbers between 150 and 200 km/h (below) and a set of subways comes in the back and uncompromisingly shrinks you.
In the editorial board, we will probably hold a discussion for a few more days about whether no one really thought about the creation of the game, or whether the authors think we are such big idiots.
The technical side of the game is nothing extra, but at least the overall visual impression is very pleasant in most cases and in some cases even great.
It will freeze so that in some of the hotter moments the shooting decreases, in some cases quite tragically.
But this is especially the case with a larger number of participants, when you would no longer have anything to do with smooth shooting.
The sound page is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to enjoy the widest range possible of a rather younger audience, a soundtrack was created from the category "every dog is different", but it can be assumed that listening to the music game is probably the only way not to buy.
The overall impression from Need for Speed: The Run is so much dissatisfied.
If the game avoided completely unnecessary mistakes, then we wouldn’t be afraid to say that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
This is how the game works unfinished.
The fun is definitely nice, but be prepared for the mistakes to be blown into your eyes by the force of the airport headlights.
The five choirs of the UK will be ringing at the concert Students of the Som

Ambassador to the EU Vice-President:
Czechs have a reputation for negativists and eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has significantly disrupted the balance between the various institutions."
"I didn't expect it to be such a tough war."
"It will take five or six years for the situation to be a bit stable, calm and before all players get used to their new roles," said Milena Vicen, Czech Ambassador to the European Union at the Faculty of Law.
As much as she takes her motto "Comprehensible and open about Europe" seriously, she showed in the first part of her lecture how she managed to describe the individual EU institutions and their relations in such a clear and comprehensible way that a number of lecturers from the Faculty of Law could be able to give her a clear and comprehensible answer.
Vicen also praised the work of the new permanent President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy:
"First, there was a criticism that it was indistinguishable that he was a grey officer, that he could not perform any role, and I have to say that everyone was breathtaking, that the role was well suited."
"He is a person who can listen to twenty-seven Member States, communicate well with them, and has a clear vision of where the European Union should go."
The new post of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained in response to the question: "Who is the European Union? To which phone number should I call?", that is, as a significant step towards the unification and greater readability of the EU policy towards countries such as India or India.
No one wants to ban syringes.
Vice-President Vice-President Vice-President Vice-President Vice-President Vice-President Vice-President Vice-President Vice-President Vice-President Vice-President Vice-President Vice-President Vice-President Vice-President Vice-President Vice-President Vice-President Vice-President Vice-President Vice-President Vice-President Vice-President Vice-President Vice-President Vice-Preside
The Czech Presidency of the Presidency was a success.
The Czechs solved the upcoming financial crisis, solved the gas crisis or organized a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at that time then marked a great negative, which greatly damaged the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is very busy at the moment.
In the words of the Ambassador, "the fact of the frog" was not only the Presidency, but also the subsequent financial crisis that is being solved to this day.
In addition, the new seven-year budget of the Union has yet to be approved, which is being significantly complicated precisely because of the current economic situation.
Whether the budget will be thin and cost-effective, which sectors will benefit, which countries will be supported more and which countries will be less, all this is on the agenda of the next negotiations.
She also reminded the Ambassador of her main slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "On Europe understandably".
"I really don't like ugly abbreviations, foreign words, haunts that no one understands.
How do citizens understand that in Brussels they really don’t invent curved or round cucumbers, bananas of different sizes, or that someone really has to ban syringes from us?”
He also wants to make better use of the EU environment and bring more Czechs into the European institutions.
A multi-speed Europe awaits us
According to the ambassador, the Czech Republic has a reputation for Eurosceptics and people who notice the negative rather than the positive sides of things.
In addition, she regrets the low representation of Czechs in the European institutions.
According to her, there are many factors to blame, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational letters, but also the low support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Four.
"Believe me, when the Polish and Hungarian come after me and the Slovak approaches, the Frenchman next to me will say, 'Hey, what are you meeting there, what's your Visegrad four?' and he's not excited about it at all."
According to Vice-President Vice-President, in the future, there are largely new tough rules for the budgetary policies of the Member States.
The concept of a two-speed, if not a multi-speed Europe is perceived as very real, rather than a new "European federation."
"We have a eurozone country and a country outside the euro zone."
"We have a Schengen area, we already have an institute of enhanced cooperation."
“For the first time it was said that only countries that want to cooperate and those that don’t want to stay away.”
"There will be more of these institutes and it will be a strong two-speed Europe," Vicen expects.
In this regard, she also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in the implementation of the principle that all issues that have an impact on the Union as a whole should be discussed among all Member States, not just between euro area countries.
Brand story:
IBM innovator starts the second century of its existence
If someone was looking for a word that would most accurately express IBM’s strategy, it would probably be “long-term”.
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution, it is perceived as very contemporary, and yet it has been a hundred years since its founding.
The foundation of this longevity was laid by the first head of the company, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He has already broken the password that a number of world problems can be easily solved if people are willing to think.
His slogan "Think!" became an imprint around the life of the future giant (and also the name of an internal magazine, which began to be published at IBM in 1935).
It was also the foundation of Watson’s carefully built corporate culture.
“For us at IBM, long-term thinking means a continuous move towards the future.
IBM has survived and thrived for a hundred years because it has remained true to its core values while not afraid to change everything else around it.
This allowed us during our first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that we will be able to achieve even more in the second hundred,” said Samuel J. Palmisano, current CEO of the company.
A refined system
Watson, in his thirties, was approaching caring for his employees in the same way as Bata’s businessman in the Czech Republic – IBM people were one of the first American employees to have paid leave, insurance from the employer plus an elegant employee uniform and a well-developed system of high-performance.
Similarly, IBM has a long-term relationship with its customers.
The company was genius in talent mining from the outset - as one of the world's first companies to abolish any discrimination, so she could choose.
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is for Palmisana to replace a woman next year, Virginia Rometty.
She has been at IBM for 30 years and still holds the position of Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
In recent years, IBM has made so-called holes, online brainstorming, from which it emerges many future strategies and innovations.
No wonder there are enough ideas - almost half a million people work in the company.
Institutions with a good name
A firm position in the business is provided by a strong internal and external image of the company.
“In the beginning, IBM had a concept of institution rather than just technology companies,” said Harvard Business School professor and author of the book about IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
“IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technology,” said George Colony of Forrester Research’s consulting firm.
As the company itself says, the difference between entering the market and creating the market straight.
IBM - or "Big Blue" as it is known in the United States due to its logo - has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a hundred years.
It is probably the most versatile technology company - it develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in a range of products from servers to nanotechnology.
She holds the most patents from all U.S. technology companies and five of her employees have won the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include an ATM, a debit card, a financial swap, a barcode or a diskette.
IBM, with approximately <0x24>220 billion, has become the second-largest technology company in terms of market capitalization (the first is Apple) this year, when Microsoft premiered for the first time since 1996.
A look at the front
Not all products and innovations have met the taste of customers and times - for example, IBM has failed to bet on its own OS/2, Prodigy online service or IBM PCjr computers.
“If your business is built to move forward, you can’t get emotionally attached to the past,” says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That’s why IBM has no problem building its foundations on many platforms – and if they don’t work, leave them.
Unlike competing Microsoft, which basically stands and falls on the Windows operating system.
Perspective technology
IBM’s revenues are the largest in terms of services, with approximately one-fifth of them being software and hardware.
In 1990, he was the strongest representative of hardware, with more than half of the share.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-income assets worth <0x24>15 billion, while investing <0x24>58 billion in prospective technology purchases.
Investments have continued since 2008, when the world’s first-ever financial crisis was overrun.
IBM is acting according to the reference of its first chief Thomas J. Watson, who also increased the volume of investment during the major economic crisis.
So far, it seems that IBM is going through the current crisis unaffected.
Since the beginning of 2008, the price of IBM shares has risen by 120 percent, with the company’s net profit steadily increasing.
IBM’s corporate motto is to change everything but not its values.
Therefore, it can be expected that even if another crisis comes, this flexible giant will cope with it.
IBM History: From Cheese Cutter to Flight into Space
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, originally called the Computing Tabulation Recording Corporation.
IBM took the name only in 1924 - it was originally a brand used for subsidiaries in Canada and South America.
IBM was founded by the merger of four companies, whose history dates back to the eighties of the nineteenth century.
They owned technology such as the famous "slippers", i.e. hours recording the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who also chaired the company's supervisory board until 1930.
Flint hired Thomas J. Watson, the company’s chief competitor, to help him manage the company.
The leader then shadowed the founders of IBM – an invincible corporate culture and identity is still built on Watson’s ideas.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, started manufacturing and selling all kinds of machines for businesses – from meat and cheese cutters to cash registers.
During the first four years that Watson ran the company, it doubled its turnover to <0x24>9 million and began its extensive expansion to all over the world.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that after nearly forty years in the chair he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence, developing the first programming language.
In the 1960s, people and computers from IBM helped NASA drive flights into space - to Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous man's flight to the Moon.
In 1964, IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "square," which set the computer standard of the time, called IBM 5150 came on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold Lenovo’s computer production to China, instead bought the consulting part of PricewaterhouseCoopers and began to fully engage in high-value consulting and services.
The strategy that IBM has been paying off over the past three years is the concept of Smarter Planet, "smarter planets".
Its aim is to make smart use of technology in even unplanned areas and to improve the situation, for example in transport or city management.
For the area of commerce, IBM recently introduced a platform "Smarter Commerce", which helps traders manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a strong history in the UK as well.
It established its branch in then Czechoslovakia in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM, the Czech Republic also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Centre for Central and Eastern Europe is based in Prague and there is also a world-class research team dedicated to voice recognition.
The Reverend of the Unfaithful Husband:
Iveta, leave that ass, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová (53) said the end!
After her husband Josef Ryktá<0xC5><0x99>a (53) became not only the protector of Iveta Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ová (45), but also the lover, Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from a pink dream and return home.
But she no longer waited and set clear rules for the next life.
"Pepa can go home, but no longer as my partner," Rychtárová explained.
When Darina Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová granted asylum to Bartosh in her house in the summer, she apparently didn’t even know how her marriage would end.
Despite the fact that Iveta moved from <0xC5><0x98>í<0xC4><0x8D>an after 30 days to her insistence, Pepa did not leave the singer.
He even publicly admitted that he loved her.
With the passage of time, Darina gave up, her husband’s relationship calmed down, and now she even gave him a goodbye forever.
I don’t care who his wife is sleeping with.
If the Rychtár and Barto<0xC5><0xA1>a had only broken up once, the wife's arms would not wait for him at home.
“He is the biological father of my sons and if he wants to live his life in our common house, no one will expel him.”
"But he will experience it not as my beloved, confused old ass, but as a man with whom I have certain ties," Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová said, with the fact that she had already separated from her husband and insisted only on mutual decency.
The fact that Darina closed his back door doesn't bother him yet.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'm going to be with Iveta and I'm not going to change it."
"My wife set up a paper marriage and I respect it."
"The company goes on, I take care of repairs, gardening, real estate, shopping."
"Darina and I have a completely normal time, except that we don't share the camp together," said Blasko Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>.
If Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová also finds a new love, she will not be defending it.
"We don't sleep together and I don't care where he goes, who he goes with, and if he has a boyfriend.
I know it’s my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take all responsibility,” Josef concluded.
Worst female habits: Do they affect you as well?
When you ask men if they were able to name some typical female habits, as a rule, everyone in one is very quickly ejected from the sleeve.
Dear women, do you know each other in the following lines, where are listed a few female habits that can perfectly pump blood into men’s veins?
Purchasing
Does your second half tell you that you are addicted to shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one blanket per week?
Do you like shopping and lots of discounts?
Then in your case, you can talk about shopping as a bad habit.
Some women realize that they should at least curtail their buying passion a little bit.
But who would resist just walking around the clothing stores, looking for well-cut tops, and then try them all (ideally in different color designs) in the cabinet?
Although for most women shopping is a horse riding, for men it can literally become a ready-made hell.
Just remember how many times you've told yours that she'd rather wait for you before you enter...
Constant dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
“I need to lose at least five pounds – should I start exercising?”
"Do you really like me?"
Doesn't this phrase remind you of something?
Is that right?
Then you're one of those women who's obsessed with what they look like.
Not that you should stop worrying about yourself, but a lot of men are directly allergic to how their partners constantly complain about their appearance.
The stronger sex also agrees that the higher the frequency of this complaint, the more annoying women are.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an endless scooter.
Washing windows, sucking, scrubbing the tiles, dusting, stirring the bathtub - at least twice a week.
You're counting on your partner to get his dirty leg on a clean tile, the kids to squeeze the scrambled sink and squeeze the glass wall of the living room with which you've done so much polishing?
In the event that you suffer from this "disadvantage", try to realize that nothing should be exaggerated and order and cleanliness should definitely not stand within the family in the first place.
This innocuous desire for cleanliness can endanger your relationships and family well-being.
R<0xC4><0xAB>p<0xC4><0x81>n<0xC4><0x81>
"You used trainers throw in the basket."
"Are you going to wear your old socks tomorrow?"
"The wet wiper does not belong to the ground."
If you dive into your partner in this way several times a day, know that this way you can dive into your partner reliably.
Of course, you don’t mean it badly, you want to make sure everything is okay.
Maybe if men knew it, women wouldn't have to dig into them that much...
Talking, crawling
For some women there are also their own slanders, slanders, but also insults and conspiracy against someone.
Women are focused on relationships, and so together they like to discuss things like who, where, with whom, how and why.
Hopefully each of us will release some harmless little drb or slut in there.
Hand on heart, it's all women's fault.
But the opposite is the thickest grain sprouts that they like and often sprout, perhaps they despise everyone and are especially dangerous for their surroundings - especially within the women's labor collective.
Yagr and Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek helped assistants win Philadelphia
Hockey striker Jaromír Jágr took part in Monday's NHL match with two assists in the Philadelphia 5:3 win over Carolina and is again at the top of the productivity of Czech players in the competition.
From the overview of the thirty-nine-year-old star, Claude Giroux gained in both cases, who added another record and was declared the best player of the match.
Jakub Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek also scored two assists in the match.
Jagr after the match with overseas journalists claimed that Giroux had predicted a big evening.
"I told him before the game to give him a hattrick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you feel that way," Jagr explained, after which action Giroux scored from the first Flyers shot.
A little later, the team’s second intervention had a Czech track.
The wrestler fought the Hurricanes disc behind the gate and placed it between the circles of the scoring Maxim Talbot.
A second before the first break was reduced by the weakened home gamer Patrick Dwyer, but the opening of the second part was once again owned by the Flyers.
Specifically Giroux.
After collaborating with Jagran, he scored a third goal, after which he scored a run in the fourth goal of Wayne Simmonds.
"I love to play with him."
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely among the top three," Jagr said.
“I would never have thought that at the end of my career I would play with a hockey player like him.”
"I'm happy about that."
"I want to play on him."
"All those years in the NHL my fellow players have tried to play for me, now it's turning around," Jagr added.
Carolina made the game a play, the goal of Tuom Ruutau and again Dwyer, who had stepped out of the penalty shootout, got a single goal difference.
However, Matt Read did not allow further complications, which ended counting two to one.
"Excellent hit in our band Pronger."
"He pushed the disc, I picked up the speed, and [Read] went to a more distant bar."
"I tried to hit him and I'm glad it worked out," Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek described the last goal of the match from his point of view.
With the victory, Philadelphia took the lead in the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav <0xC5><0xA0>pa<0xC4><0x8D>ek did not win the match against Buffalo, in the second third he retired due to injuries in the upper part of the body.
In addition to the experienced beak, the Candiens also lost their two-point lead and lost after a penalty shootout of 2:3.
One of them was not transformed by Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Plekanec.
Instead of losing points, the home coach hated a large back-end margin, with only five defenders playing the game.
"It's bad."
"We played the match with only one experienced player, the rest were young people."
"But there is nothing to be done about it, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
“The shift behind the shift was on us and we couldn’t resist it.”
"We should have simplified the game more, moved the puck out of our band."
We had gaps in that," added one of the defenders P.K. Subban.
Czech goalkeeper Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Pavelec contributed thirty wins by Winnipeg to a 5:2 win over Tampa Bay.
The Jets, who interrupted the five-point series of the Prophet, were divided by five different shooters.
How Travel Prices Have Evolved Since 1989
Until 1989, only five state travel agencies were allowed in Czechoslovakia: <0xC4><0x8C>edok, Sporturist, CKM, Recrea and Autoturist.
Travel offices at the time sold in the vast majority only trips to the countries of the socialist bloc, as travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists travelled on holiday to the sea to the NDR (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union (Sochi in the Crimea near the Black Sea), to Bulgaria, Romania (they fight to the Black Sea) and to Hungary (Balaton).
A light exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when the possibility of travelling to Yugoslavia was also possible, but then the Yugoslav regime acceded to the West and the travel of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia were subsequently very limited.
The great paradox of socialism was that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also Czechoslovakians) were not allowed to travel individually freely even within socialist countries.
If a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or to the Soviet Union, he needed a letter from that country, otherwise the individual journey was not possible.
Travel agencies at the time also offered trips to the West, but it was necessary to stand in front overnight with a sleeping bag or have a "good friend" in the travel agency.
However, it was not won.
The so-called foreign exchange promise, which was a condition for travel to the West, was not given to "politically unreliable people" who could not travel at all.
In fact, the Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so without a currency promise it was not possible to obtain financial means (western currency) for the journey to the West.
However, by far the Czechs most often spent holidays in the countryside, which resulted in the large number of chalets and chalets that the Czechs acquired and this habit survives to this day.
The travel of the Czechs has experienced a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989, holidays in the NDR or Bulgaria were our maximum, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million holidays abroad in countries around the world.
A huge paradox that we are no longer aware of today is that it was not possible for us to travel freely to the present most popular Croatia until 1989, as it was part of the then Yugoslavia.
At the end of the 1990s, visa waivers were abolished in neighbouring Western European countries, triggering a huge wave of short-term visits to Austria and Germany.
The Czechoslovakians could not afford to travel to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to look at it at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris, Czech tours were made in parks in tents, as our then income did not allow us to pay our hotel or pension.
A typical feature of the Czechs’ journey at this time was to drive their own food, cans, salads, etc. to save money.
Another important moment was the introduction of the freely convertible Czech crown, which finally allowed our tourists to freely buy the western currency after many decades.
However, our standard of living and, with it, the average wages have risen, leading to another important moment around 1997.
Due to the increased demand for travel, travel agencies have started regularly from 1997 to prepare for trips with charter air connections, making air travel incredibly discounted thanks to the possibility of contracting quantitative discounts compared to the past.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs had visa-free contact with virtually all the developed countries of the world, except the United States, which further facilitated our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-evolutionary travel occurred in 2000, when due to significant demand, the first historically direct charter flight to exotics was to Thailand.
From this year onwards, Czech tourists fly direct charter to warm distant countries, this winter will fly directly from the Czech Republic to twelve exotic destinations.
Exotic countries are currently visited by around 100,000 Czechs a year!
Another interesting moment in this period, symbolizing our post-evolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States canceled the visa for Czech tourists, making our country one of the most advanced countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czech Republic also spent more than half of its holiday abroad (50.3%) for the first time in its history and for the first time in its history, spending more than CZK 15,000 per person on a holiday abroad.
The General Assembly is to find the President, but again threatens to
Czech football has been without a president for almost five months and threatens that the successor of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ka, head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), will not be known after another extraordinary general meeting, which will take place on Thursday in Nymburka.
There is still no agreement as to what electoral procedure will be followed.
Without it, no vote will begin on which of the three candidates will be elected.
Interested in leading Czech football are Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík.
Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek resigned in June and, upon his departure, urged colleagues to unite and find a strong personality that would lead football in the future.
But in the aftermath of Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ka, football slipped back to the gaps between the two Bundeskammers, which could not agree on a joint candidate.
It turned out to be September 16, when a new president was to be elected.
Delegates of the General Assembly sat in the National House in Prague on Smíchov, as the talks remained blocked and were not just about the way of the election.
There was no consensus on who had the right to vote in the assembly - whether only the statutory representatives or the full-power officials.
In this single point, there has been a partial agreement since then, which was assisted by the recommendation of the Constitution for the State and the Law, according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
Controversies still exist about the electoral order.
The Executive Committee has not made the situation too clear, which, in its negotiations, whether regular or extraordinary, does not, in essence, resolve anything else.
The view of the choice has changed several times, but the neuralgic point is still the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the 3rd round to exclude the possibility of a beard?
"The sport is whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or to find another model," said one of the three vice-presidents of FA<0xC4><0x8C>R Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Svoboda, who represents professional football in the leadership of the association.
According to the statutes of the proposed model in the third round, the candidate who will have a higher percentage of support in the chamber than the candidate.
Morava is said to be willing to go to the concession to win a candidate who will win a higher sum of votes from both chambers.
And the Czech party advocates the condition that the winner must gain a dominance of at least two-thirds in this percentage count.
"But then it would lose the meaning of the previous two wheels, it would completely deny the two-chamber concept," he understands the opposition of the Moravian Svoboda party, according to which the best order would be not to swing and vote in accordance with the statutes in force.
Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík agrees with this somewhat surprisingly, although it is estimated that the electoral order determined by the Statute corresponds the most to Pelt of all candidates.
"I would like to vote as much as possible according to the rules."
"In order not to think of any deputy nonsense as in the previous general assembly," said owner Viktorie Plze<0xC5><0x88>, who is nominated for the first time, and in his statements he was especially opposed to Pelt.
Pelta remains an optimist.
According to him, the new president will be known in Nymburka and believe that the candidates will cooperate constructively in the future.
"All the passions will calm the possible progress of today's national team to the European Championships."
“Football will be happy again, it will be more willing to cooperate,” says Appleman, who has the biggest experience in football driving at both the professional and regional levels.
Rajchl is more resilient.
"I hope it's a deal, but unfortunately the situation is very fragmented."
"It is not between the people of the Czech Republic and Moravia, but there are attempts to adapt the regulations purposely."
"This can cause the blockade of the general assembly to happen again."
"But I hope he will win common sense," said Rajchl.
There is not much time left for agreement between all parties.
Some of the talks were supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football generality will be complete until the match.
The flight special, in which they were to travel to Podgorica, among other things Vice-Presidents Dalibor Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era and Rajchl, did not depart from Prague because of the technical breakdown in the morning and was looking for a replacement variant, how part of the executive committee to take the barrage transport to the historic site.
In the end, there may be a decisive meeting at the ministerial level, which may take place on Wednesday.
The Minister of Education, Youth and Physical Education Josef Dobe<0xC5><0xA1> would like to bring the divided parties within the country’s strongest sports association to an agreement.
There is a lot in the game: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the general assembly of <0xC4><0x8C>STV, which will solve the new direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of the Rate.
Pacquiao goes to the president's fight because he doesn't see the right candidate
If the head of football players of Plze<0xC5><0x88>, Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík, in front of the extraordinary general assembly saw a strong candidate who would fulfill all his ideas about the new president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), he would not even join the fight for the supreme function.
"If a quality adept exists, I fight for him and I don't go to the election."
"But in the current situation, no one like this has been found," <0xC4><0x8C>TK Paclík said.
In the fight with Miroslav Pelta and Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajch, Paclíka is motivated to try to prevent Pelt, the alleged favorite of the election, from heading FA<0xC4><0x8C>R.
Paclík also stressed that in the event of his victory, he would only last as president until 2013, when the regular general assembly is on the agenda.
In the position, he would like to see an experienced and top manager, who is not too related to the football event.
“I’ve talked to some people who would come into consideration.”
“It was crazy for me when some people said they didn’t even want to identify with Czech football at this point.”
"I would like to change that view," he said.
Paclík says that Pelt’s connection with the president of the Pilsen Regional Football Association, Roman Berbrem, a man with a controversial reputation who is known behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of delegates at the general assembly, is the most disturbing of all.
It is so unacceptable for Paclík to have Pelta become president.
"If he wins, the current state will be preserved and nothing in football will move forward."
"In combination with the support of Berbra, who is a good dealer, it would not benefit football any more," Paclík said.
It also points out that Pelt’s name appeared in the posts in the investigation of the corruption affair years ago, but Pelt came out of it with no penalty.
"I don't know what prestige Pelt's victory would bring."
"And what would we look like in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," Paclík said, who is also taking over his previous statement that he would "sell the Pilsen club if Pelta became president."
However, if Paclík triumphed in Thursday’s election, he could imagine future cooperation with Pelta.
He also considers another candidate Rajchl, whom Paclík supported before the September general assembly, which ended in failure.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I'd go after."
"He has great abilities."
"I could have imagined him as the head of the team."
"But managerially he couldn't run the association."
"I also don't sneeze where I don't know it," Paclík said, who in September attracted great attention by standing behind the appeal of the arbitration committee led by Lud<0xC3><0xBD>k Macela, who was replaced by Dagmar Damková.
Paclík claims that he would take the lead of the association.
He relies on his ability to manage private companies, and since last summer he has also been in charge of Pilsen, which with his support celebrated the Premier League triumph in May.
“I have the strength to make a change in the football environment so that I can contribute to his cultivation.”
"To limit the influences of some interest groups, which may have a tendency to influence the disciplinary and appeals committees, which deals with disgusting situations," said Paclík, who does not hide his antipathy to Spartan chief Daniel Kr<0xC4><0x9B>tínské, for example.
He would also consider the tightening of FA<0xC4><0x8C>R’s relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he would lobby political leaders to get more money from the lottery tax in the sport.
"It's one of the key things that a new president should do."
"If there is a taxation of gambling, as the political parties declare, I understand their arguments, but at the same time they have to tell where the money is going," he said.
As a burden now Paclík does not even take his connection with the Plze<0xC5><0x88> club, although he himself claims that the president of FA<0xC4><0x8C>R should be "multilateral".
Pelta is connected with Jablonce, Rajchl with Prague Dukla.
"It's not ideal."
"But I don't see any sense in transferring my shares to someone hypocritically in the Pilsen club and in a year and a half back there," Paclík said.
Pelta promised new FA<0xC4><0x8C>R statutes that would exclude the election pat
Two days before the general meeting of the football association, one of the candidates for president Miroslav Pelta promised that in the event of an election, it would be established that FA<0xC4><0x8C>R would have new statutes that would definitively exclude disputes over the electoral order in the future.
The Jablonec official is optimistic ahead of Thursday's Nymburc talks and believes that the pre-election fight significantly undermines the possible success of today's football team.
Pelta promised before the election in September that he would concentrate on representing and obtaining finances in the event of the election.
Before the last general election, he decided to go to the last minute, so a two-month postponement could fit him to defend his ideas about football and present them in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and expect the president to be known on Thursday."
“He feels it’s time for someone to lead the association,” says the man, who is primarily associated with the Apple Club, but who has worked for many years in Sparta and the executive committee of the association.
He also believes that he has enough experience to be able to drive Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election is the euphoria that prevailed during the reign of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ka.
"Unfortunately, the June General Assembly approved statutes that were not as perfect as everyone thought."
“If different interpretations were not allowed, we had a president since September,” Pelta said.
It was the recasting of the most important document of the civil association that he conceived as a gift to the delegates.
“If I become president, I will take it as a personal task and I am willing to take personal responsibility if it fails.”
"It's a principled thing that we can't be without," Pelta says.
He said he was trying not to fight his opponents.
He had previously announced that he could imagine working with Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajch, whom he recognized for his legal education, and he knew well that his opponent would be his first vice-president.
For a long time he did not attack Tomás Paclík, who, on the contrary, did not leave a thread dry on Pelt.
"In football, he's been moving a little over a year, he's got some successes already."
“But his attacks were unworthy and many people were surprised by the way the election campaign took place.”
"That's why many of them are now doubting his true character," Pelt told his opponent's address, which he said remains true to the announcements he announced in September.
His most powerful weapon is his knowledge of football from the lowest competitions to the national team.
That should be a football interpreter's closet.
"And I would also try to end all affairs starting with the Bohemians case or the rumors of last year's corruption scandal."
“I would then go to talks with both the private and public sectors to ensure we have enough money for the whole football,” said <0xC4><0x8C>TK’s forty-six-year-old candidate two months ago.
At that time, he also promised that his arrival at the head of football would not mean any personal cleansing.
"I should first get acquainted with the fillings of individual employees," he pointed to Fearov, where there is a comprehensible nervousness from the long-running.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios accompanying the general assembly, they believe that delegates will not go to Nymburk in vain on Thursday.
"If the only question is how he will vote in the third round, we will be able to pass through it."
“Football needs credibility, and it will only win here by finally having its leader again,” Pelta said two days before the perhaps decisive day of his career as an optimist.
Rajchl promises that under him the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R would begin to work hard
If the new president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic was elected to the Thursday General Assembly by the former Vice-President Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, many people in the association would say it would be unpleasant.
Rajchl promises that in the event of his election, he will start working hard.
He wants to make systemic changes and make the members of the executive committee responsible for each football area.
He also promised to solve the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work started by former President Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
"As president, I would like to dedicate myself to football as a whole."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA through teams, professional football, performance football to youth."
"But I'm not saying I would do it all by myself," Rajchl said in an interview with <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
"I'm a team player and I want to allocate competencies to the Executive Committee so that each member is dedicated to a specific area."
"And I'm going to give hard tasks to push football a mile ahead in every segment."
“Many people would probably not be happy because they would start working really hard and not just criticizing the work of others,” he added.
Due to the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he said he thought he would not run again.
"I know I'm working 20 hours a day."
“But I need to know that it will make sense and that I won’t have people behind me who will constantly throw claps under my feet and question every step I take,” he explained.
“Many people told me that I shouldn’t give up, because then others would give up.”
"That's the confidence I can't just throw away," he said.
It also motivates him to continue the work he started with Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ka.
"There's been a lot of work done in those two years and I don't want to throw it away now."
“Processes have been initiated that will take up to a few years, and I don’t want anyone to stop them,” he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, was elected, the situation could return to the time before the Hague.
"I believe in systematics, and that's something I don't think Mirek Pelt can do."
"There are people behind it who would make football so that it would be just for the chosen ones."
"I can count a lot of things, but I certainly don't want to side with someone."
"I try to be objective."
"I want to play football for everyone, because then everyone will have a good time and not just you," Rajchl said.
He also claimed that he was only a Czech president.
“Even though some people are trying to say the opposite, I plan to do the maximum for Moravia.”
"For example, it is time to think about the fact that the second league would be divided into the Czech and Moravian part, the winners of which would go into the first league."
"There would not be a situation where there are only three Moravian teams in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravian," Rajchl said.
Since the head of the Pilsen club Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík has also been involved in the fight for the president, Rajchl does not expect to estimate his chances of an election.
"But I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has chosen me as its Vice-President, and they see that there are clear successes behind me," said Rajchl, who considers savings of tens of millions of crowns on unfavourable contracts, lottery deals and TV counterparts.
The fact that the band doesn’t fit for one string is the same as the other.
While Pelt declares that he is "disqualified from giving back to Czech football confidence", Paclík considers the second of his rivals a strong candidate who has football to offer.
“No one can doubt that he has done a great job in Pilsen for that year.”
"If he was elected, he would probably continue with the things that Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek started here and would not change the staffing of the commissions."
"He wouldn't want to do it in his favor," said rivals Rajchl.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Jump to the blue
Julia Stanek
From the viewpoint of the Ufon, the superb swimming pool in Budapest: If you travel through Europe, you can experience your blue wonder – and after a tour of the city or travel let your tired feet rest in the thermal spas.
The book will show you where the wellness at the water is most beautiful.
When Iris Meder was on her discovery trip for the past one and a half years, her baggage was not to be missed: her swimsuits.
Sitting on the water, she looked up to the domes, swam in front of the marble paths (buildings of a small naked boy, a child (with wings)) waiting for her at the edge of the pool and admired carefully restored secession swimmers.
If she liked a float, she took it into her notebook in a bag - even with remarkable details about the way the building was built and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimmers have explored Meder's architecture in this way and now presents them in her recently published book "Badefreuden": People's swimmers in Munich, the historic palace of swimmers in Schwarzwald, "Hard core of concrete buildings" in Taunus.
13 countries led her "The Road to the Most Unusual Spas in Central Europe": Next to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited locations in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and always in one city.
The 46-year-old German is a true enthusiast of floating culture.
With sports it doesn’t go too far, says Meder – just in water it’s something else.
It is only to anger that fan swimmers have to satisfy the blue ticks and the smell of chlorine, while health runners can breathe the opaque smell of pine forests or listen to the joyful brilliance of birds in the park.
“One day I asked why the shipyards must always be so cozy,” said Meder, who lives in Vienna.
"That's how I started collecting nice floats."
The water level doubles the architecture
Swimming in the jumping pool and essential oils for the sauna - therefore the factor of well-being is so great that it affects all the senses, so much Mrs. Meder.
And when the founders tried, floats can be a real pasture for the eyes: "The place of the floor has a man in the bath water level."
"It is also transparent, but on the other hand, it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything is optically duplicated: high jewelry, varied tiles, jumping boards.
The small-format picture volume "Badefreuden" provides on 190 pages everything you need to know about the architectural and cultural history of the historic wellnes oasis - but above all, it excites the taste of jumping into the blue.
Remarkable specimens were discovered by the float collector Mrs. Meder during her search in Hungary.
In addition to the wonderful healing baths, such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi baths in Budapest, she found water with nitrogen content in the original Kras cave (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) and the thermal baths, the pools of which are filled in the limestone and the alkaline vod<0xC5><0xAF>v<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xAF> V<0xC4><0x9B>ro<0xC4><0x8D>e vodo.
On the other hand, many heated swimming pools under the wide sky in Switzerland and Austria offer a beautiful view. As long as you have a rooftop swimming pool in the sight of the whole city, you can enjoy a swimming pool in the outdoor pool of the Arnolds, which is a steam bath in the St.
Probably the most striking design of the pool is expected by spa guests in Längenfeld: Aquapark <0xC3><0x96>tztal looks like a UFO that just landed in the Alps.
From the top three open pans in the winter, steam rises while looking to the sky in the background of the <0xC3><0x96>tztal mountain.
Alhambra and the Black Forest
Not in every float, the pool collector Mrs. Meder's smell of chlorine went up into the cages.
Many thermal baths are felt after sulphur, in the spas of <0xC3><0x81>rpád in Bekessabá, Hungary, it smells like hot oil to the extent that one can hardly believe that he got into the therapeutic baths.
The odor comes from the medicinal water with the content of alkaline hydrogen dioxide, which is almost black and whose sediments bloom on the skin as soon as a person enters the pool - a somewhat special wellness experience.
However, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for beautiful spas: When she wanted to visit the Czech solar and climate spa Luha<0xC4><0x8D>ovice, she encountered a closed field.
In 1902, the spas designed by the architect Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Jurkovich were closed.
When Mrs. Meder looked at the shattered windows of the red-white-yellow sewer buildings, she saw how the grass grew tremendously between the tiles.
Zánik stood opposite this at the magical floating farm in Schwarzwald: at the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
These baths already have three phases of construction; one can discover not only the new Romanesque elements that date back to their founding in 1844, but also the Alhambra-style Moorish Hall, which was connected around 1900.
Since its meticulous modernization in 1995, Palais Thermal has been a popular spa resort for swimming pool expert Iris Meder, not only because it comes from Schwarzwald.
"It's already some kind of performance, connecting so diverse construction styles into such a wonderful complex," Mrs. Meder says.
In such a palace, immersion in the thermal pool is probably a marginal issue.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank to Investigate Commodity Trade
Christian Teevs
Will Deutsche Bank abandon its agricultural commodities trade?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the poor world.
In January, the CEO of the company wants to see the consequences.
Hamburg - Hamburg
For federal citizens, it is clear: 84% of Germans, according to one study, consider it unacceptable for banks to speculate on agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two-thirds of respondents even demanded that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions exit the trade because it deepens the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey from Foodwatch’s consumer endorsement.
The study is based on a report that Foodwatch presented in mid-October.
In it, author Harald Schumann shows that betting on global commodity exchanges raises prices and therefore the banks share the global hunger problem.
The consumer protection campaign is targeted specifically against Deutsche Bank boss Josef Ackermann, although large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley are also acting similarly.
Originally, commodity bets were designed to insure traders against price fluctuations.
In the meantime, however, most experts agree that capital market participants with an interest in high-risk trades have turned away from supply and demand – and made profits at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the U.S., Ackermann responded to criticism: He promised to verify the excavations and said that no trade "is worth noting that the good reputation of Deutsche Bank is being placed at stake."
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group controls the Foodwatch-Report.
By the end of the year, the audit is to be completed, then the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank Board of Directors - together with a recommendation on how to charge it.
At the end of January, the bank’s representatives would then want to tell what the consequences would be.
In the end, there could be a reduction in commodity trade or even a complete rejection.
Ackermann works on his own image with self-help.
The head of Foodwatch, Thilo Bode, welcomed the report, but at the same time strengthened his criticism of the financial sector: "Sitting at rising food prices shows particularly drastically how recklessly banks are detrimental to the general welfare today."
Let Ackermann, as the highest bank lobbyist, take responsibility.
"Deutsche Bank must cut all items from its portfolio that use money to bet on food prices," Bode said.
"It's awkward whether Mr. Ackermann is about people who are starving or the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann’s outlook seems surprising at first glance, but it’s clear that the CEO would like to leave the perfect picture a few months before leaving office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the chairman of the board would not join the supervisory board.
By turning away from controversial agricultural speculation, it could improve its image.
And you don't have to worry about the possible losses - it should be handled by his successor in the end.
Everyone else would cancel their investment in raw materials.
Foodwatch is trying to maintain high pressure on the manager.
So far, more than 30,000 internet users have participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published a survey in which the Forsa Institute surveyed 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Accordingly, just eleven percent consider it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments with which food prices bets are associated.
Many bank customers would also have personal consequences if they learned that their bank is involved in such trades: each other would, as a result of the survey, cancel all investments in which money is diverted into speculation with raw materials.
43 percent would warn a bank like this, 49 percent said they would think about canceling their account and go to another institution.
House of the 21st century in Vienna
Relocated Pavilion
Ingeborg Wiensowski
The history of architecture with peaks, falls and happy endemic: The Austrian pavilion of the World Exhibition in Brussels in 1958 won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, remained empty and abandoned.
It is now reopened as an exhibition house.
When climbing for modern post-war architecture, for bright shapes, glass halls, bold scales and new building materials typical of faith in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer is the exhibition for the Brussels World Exhibition and 1958 exhibition.
Schwanzer’s pavilion was awarded the Grand Prix d’Architecture for its lightweight and vibrant steel and glass construction.
The building is still considered a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He celebrated the architect in such a way that the Austrian Pavilion was also built during the next world exhibition.
With its legendary four-wheel-driven BMW Palace plus as the key to the side building in Munich, it finally became internationally famous in 1973.
As a temporary exhibition building, the projected pavilion after the world exhibition was placed in the Schweizer Garten near Vienna's Südbahnhof (Südbahnhof), rebuilt and in 1962 opened the Museum of the 20th century - it was named as the "House of the 20th Century".
However, the building was not suitable for the museum, either spatially or technically - there was a lack of walls for hanging art exhibits, no suitable climate.
However, it was used until contemporary art reached a new stand in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and more and more floating.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has rebuilt the pavilion, now called the "House of the 21st Century" and will be used in the future as a Museum of Contemporary Art.
On Tuesday evening, the Museum Belvedere, to which the palace belongs, will open its first exhibition - a happy intention in every respect.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery in 2007, was introduced.
Husslein-Arco, a promoted art historian with a significant career, among others in her youth as a sculptor, later at Sotheby's, Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, made a significant contribution to the reconstruction of the arts, arts and craftsmen's collections.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritze Wotruby should be exhibited by a foundation of the same name, a café and a bookstore should be created, and an office building should be built for this purpose.
Strict supervision, low budget.
Krischanitz was then the ideal occupation for the execution.
Not only did he delicately reconstruct and expand Joseph Olbrich’s secession buildings in Vienna and win the competition, but because he studied at Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was an “extremely important” place for him, to which he was able to build almost every corner.
He knew the original project and also knew the problems of the building, which had already lost its generosity and lightness when it moved to Vienna and changed its use.
In the current reconstruction, there were far more problems: the building was a "catapult for energy", says Krischanitz.
The profiles of the windows of the glass facade were replaced, used with glass fiber reinforced insulation glass and the glass roof replaced with a special safety glass.
Cold-steel bridges were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings were refurbished.
The two underground floors provided a place for new use, the lighting channel between the building and the street obtains lighting, leads to the entrance of the bridge - almost a new building, but still the uplifting Schwanzer Pavilion.
The original entrance door has been preserved, the building is painted in an old anti-corrosion reddish-brown color tone.
And the cinema is still exactly the same as it used to be.
And all under the strict supervision of the memorial office and a low budget.
"Frequently, material has to be found that is good and cheap and also liked the memorial office," says Krischanitz, pointing to the broken floor of the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reconstruction, the building remained flexible and airy.
It was difficult to say it was with the pavilion, "who came here from Brussels," said recently Krischanitz, a typical "Drop-in-the-City-history".
Such architecture is said to be “always in the wrong place” and still wants to “raise proper self-confidence”.
In this case, however, the 21st century House is not in the wrong place, because a happy urban accident occurred: In the district around Schweizer Garten a completely newly designed "City Quarter near the Main Station" with office and residential houses is created.
And maybe there’s another lucky coincidence: the 21st century house could have received support from another Krischanitz building, because collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle and, as you can hear, already talks with the city about a neighbourhood at a residence in Schweizer Garten.
The Roadmap Plans a Package for the Winter Crisis in Millions
The trail has outlined a crisis plan to prevent train crashes in the winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
It'll cost millions.
In the fight against winter train crashes and delays, Deutsche Bahn is spending more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70 million this year, according to a report in the newspapers.
The newspaper "Bild" brought a preliminary report, referring to the internal group plan, that is said to be expected to have a total investment of around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million by 2015.
It is said to make better use of trains and rail networks also in extreme weather conditions.
It is planned, among other things, to double the number of internal and external employees to 16,000 people to remove the snow on railway facilities and stops.
The goal is to get rid of the start-up and 90 percent of the required breaks in four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, chief Rüdiger Grube warned of train crashes and delays during this winter after meeting at the highest level with government and industry representatives.
During the past winter, the trail had considerable problems in passenger transport, as among other things, under difficult weather conditions, it had a shortage of reserves.
So many new regional trains have been awaiting approval by the Federal Railways Authority for years.
In addition, delays in the journey of ICE trains
For years, the track has also been unable to control the repairs of ICE trains more frequently when the repairs were destroyed by an ICE train at Cologne’s main station.
Deutsche Bank pays a million-dollar fine in the U.S.
After the move around boss Josef Ackermann, there are new traps in the US: Deutsche Bank has to pay millions of dollars of damages there.
As if Deutsche Bank had not had enough problems at home, the U.S. industry has repulsed its past: the Frankfurt institution pays <0x24>145 million in one settlement procedure to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks in a financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage bonds.
The NCUA’s financial market regulator calculates a number of large banks that they have led cooperative banks with false promises to buy financial products; that they have probably reduced risks.
Such securities lost substantially in value during the crisis and dragged banks with them into bankruptcy.
"We are pleased that we were able to resolve the issue without the parties having to go to court," a spokesman for Deutsche Bank said in New York.
The bank does not admit any guilt by compensating.
This also applies to Citigroup, which has pledged to pay <0x24>20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the warmth of both monetary institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for cooperative banks in the U.S. and helps in bankruptcy to protect customer claims.
The NCUA is seeking compensation for billions of damages.
Now finished alignments are the first of their kind.
The regulator was also indicted by other large banks and in the summer sued JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
Dubious mortgage securities are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
They are based on bank loans.
When the U.S. real estate bubble collapsed in 2007, it became a fate for a number of financial companies.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, US-Investmentbank Lehman Brothers changed its mindset.
Even though the events took place a few years ago, the banks are now in a hurry by a sharp wind.
Investors and supervisory authorities have filed numerous lawsuits in order to make corrections or make mistakes.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has launched the largest wave of lawsuits.
According to 18 international large banks, two U.S. state finance ministers dealing with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s property in mortgage transactions of about <0x24>200 billion have been deprived.
Deutsche Bank is also faced with the FHFA lawsuit, which includes more transactions worth about <0x24>14.2 billion between 2005 and 2007.
The Surveillance Authority requires the Frankfurt Institute to be responsible for "substantial losses" without, however, specifying any exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the claims as unfounded and declared that it wants to defend itself.
Warren Buffett joins IBM with <0x24>10 billion
Financial guru Buffett is investing heavily in IBM’s IT company.
Since March, he has bought shares worth more than <0x24>10 billion.
So far, major U.S. investor Warren Buffett has always declared that he will not invest in IT and computers, because the long-term development of companies is left only with difficulties to predict.
Now, however, he has read IBM’s business reports and changed his opinion on investment in the industry.
Already, he had to understand that IBM primarily offers services and hires computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
Warren Buffett’s investments are considered to be knights’ pass in the financial world.
As a result, IBM’s native IT mountain can now be called “Sir IBM”.
Buffett has announced on CNBC that it has been buying <0x24>10.7 billion in shares of IBM since March.
His Investmentholding Berkshire Hathaway became one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said IBM didn't know anything about his involvement yet.
He commended the management, who sought even good returns during the economic crisis.
“You did a great job,” Buffett told the strategy.
IBM has long relied on lucrative IT services such as the operation of computing centers.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as powerful computers for companies.
Buffett has been avoiding tech companies to this day.
It claims that it invests only in companies whose activities it also understands.
Instead, Buffett ran for the freight railroad, for the lubricant manufacturer, or for the machines.
His holding Berkshire Hathaway also owns some 80 of its own subsidiaries and shares in a number of major corporations such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re, formerly Municher Rück.
The 81-year-old took over Berkshire Hathaway, a small textile company in the 1960s, and made it one of the world’s most valuable enterprises with wise investments.
Yet his way of life is modest.
This is why it is a cult character for many investors around the world.
His almost unmistakable sense of making money brought him the nickname "Orakel of Omaha".
When Buffett’s investment became known, IBM’s stocks rose by 1% before the stock market began.
“Big Blue,” as IBM is also called, has a total price of more than <0x24>220 billion on the stock market and is listed together with Apple and Microsoft as the world’s most valuable tech companies.
At Microsoft, so much Buffett would not want to perform.
Bill Gates is said to be his close friend.
The threat is tangible
After the discovery of "Cells in Zwickau", Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
The newspaper even talks about a “bloodful ideology” that is now reviving.
The murders of eight small businessmen of Turkish and one Greek origin between 2000 and 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
In Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany, the report was reacted with fear and concern.
For many German Turks, this brings back a horror that has long been considered dead: since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence against the right-wing extremist background.
There is no doubt that there is xenophobia in Germany.
The right-wing extremist network, however, reveals a range whose dimensions cannot be overlooked for a long time.
"Is the bloody ideology alive again?" were the titles of the online edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The Sabah newspapers, on the other hand, point out that one of the perpetrators was to be a secret police agent of the constitutional protection unit and fear that German authorities could also be involved in the right-wing radical basin.
The Turkish village of Germany reacted courageously: It recalled the weekend of demonstrations by silence in front of the Brandenburg Gate for victims of racist violence.
It was only two weeks ago that the Turkish municipality in Berlin, together with German and Turkish policies, recalled the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
In cheerful colors, a shared life was sketched – as a history of success.
As a shelf, several Turkish media reports: "Germany's Day to the Fifties" is the headline of the article on the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the background of the murder series.
Also, the issue of the letter "Hürriet" for Germany cannot be taken without this connection of thought.
"It's starting to smell," the column title sounds from Ahmet Külahci.
It stresses that people who paid taxes and made an important contribution to the restoration of Germany have been murdered.
The most critically discussed is the police procedure and its late success in the search in German-Turkish internet forums.
Why the German authorities did not think much earlier to look for suspects in right-wing extremist circles, the authors wonder.
Thus, many rhetorically present themselves as ready to use drastic means: "If the activity continues to be carried out here so superficially, the immigrant will have nothing but his own defense and armament."
“That would be the best self-defense.”
"The quality of clarification and the proportionality of the punishment of the entire network depends very strongly on internal peace in Germany," writes "Selen".
This means that if internal peace in Germany is under threat, the assassinations in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s clarify.
The photograph of the fireplace in Solingen is deeply thrown into the memory of the Germans and Turks.
For no other event has made it more clear to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat here, and to the Germans that distrust and retreat can lead to right-wing violence.
However, the assassinations made the Turks' side more apparent sense of reciprocity.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
The Turkish press criticized the failure of German politics after the assassinations: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors in Mölln.
After the fire attack in Solingen, he sent a sympathetic telegram to the Turkish president, but he was allowed to represent his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel at the funeral ceremony in Cologne - Kinkel then calculated in his speech what fees the Turks here handed over.
Pretty much as if the value of a person is measured by the amount of his taxes.
The current Turkish media report shows once again how deep the mistrust of many German Turks in the state-run system is.
In addition to the effort to clarify and reassess the right-wing extremist terrorism in Germany, this time it requires open words.
Scandal Bank near Lake Curaçao
The most charitable bank in Europe is based not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS has suffered from a financial crisis almost bankrupt and has since gone from one crisis to another.
Some Germans are comparing it now.
Axel Weber certainly didn't think so.
After his noisy resignation from the Federal Bank’s leadership, it became known in July that he would enter 2013 into almost the same spectacular new job: the president of the board of the Swiss Grand Bank UBS – an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber looked forward to publicly praising Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired solidity, and making friendly remarks to future colleagues.
"The UBS has reached the turn".
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But in September it was clear that everything would be completely different.
A dealer from UBS in London circumvented all the bank’s security systems and wasted about 1.7 billion euros.
UBS board chief Oswald Grübel, not only a recognized banker in Switzerland, had to leave.
The president of the UBS board has been on fire since then – and everyone is asking: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It has already become known that Weber banks have been allowed to work since February 2012.
And we will take over the Presidency of the Board of Directors already in May - not only in 2013, the bank said on Tuesday.
It's going to be tough for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather a professor of economics and an issuer and would certainly need time to work.
We will then take responsibility for the bank’s strategy, which has proven once again that it deserves the title of “Bank of the Biggest Scandals in Europe”
Because UBS is huge – until recently it was the largest asset manager in the world – and has been sliding from one scandal to another for years.
Nothing, it seems, will be left to the proud Swiss bank.
It started with the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of a silent and solid, but also intelligent asset manager is combined with ambitious goals: She also wanted to mean something in investment banking.
In 2007, UBS managed <0x24>1.6 trillion more clients than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, she moved as an investment bank into the league of the world’s largest banks.
It made an impression.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and later a long-time professor of banking in Zurich, said: “I always used UBS as a model of a good bank to my students at that time.”
From today’s point of view, one asks, “How could I just be so wrong?”
He was very wrong.
In 2007, for the first time, it was clear that something had failed properly in UBS.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, who was considered a highly intelligent and brilliant banker, resigned surprisingly.
A few months later, he figured out why he left.
The bank’s investment division wasted the Subprime papers and had to write off billions.
To stop it, UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs.
That’s why she actually found investors, but one that she would have recently scoffed at: the opaque Asian State Fund from Singapore and the Arab State Fund, which was so discreet that one didn’t even know its name.
But it was only the first shock.
In April 2008, it got worse.
The bank had to admit new billion-dollar losses, chairman Marcel Ospel, Switzerland’s second-best-paid board of directors, resigned in 2006.
In October 2008, a disaster followed: UBS stood behind the financial crisis before collapse due to its wrong investments and had to be rescued by the state.
The National Bank bought back from UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities, while the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs to compulsory securities for which it could have become a partner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland has been shaken - because you have noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it has such large banks on its territory.
After all, the UBS 2007 balance sheet was more than five times higher than the performance of the Swiss economy (see figure).
“We couldn’t save UBS again,” says banking expert Geiger.
The first disaster is followed by the second.
For several months, UBS has been capitulating to this in a tax dispute with America, and has expressed a willingness to release data on prospective customers who have, if possible, reduced taxes with the help of banks.
In addition, she agreed to pay <0x24>780 million – as a return for unauthorized profits from these trades, including a fine.
As a result, UBS became more or less open about helping tax cuts.
At the same time, she lost something that has always been her capital in the competition for rich clients: the shrine of discretion.
After this scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer what it used to be.
Following the resignation of the Chairman of the Board and the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customers' money.
Thus, over the course of several months, the bank lost its credibility in both central business areas: in investment banking due to poor speculation and in asset management to help reduce taxes.
And just as it calmed down a bit, just as it was thought that UBS had recovered, here comes this unfortunate trading base: the only dealer wasted 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed something was wrong.
And it’s clear: with risk management in investment banking, it probably still doesn’t work.
“In the case of Adoboli, it is likely that risk control has changed too little,” says Martin Janssen, an economist and finance professor of finance at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
The chief financial officer of the German bank also said: “The problem with UBS is that it cannot control risk.”
At the same time, it was precisely the idea of prudence that Swiss bankers long ago took to become guardians of the world’s great assets: no too big risks, therefore, security for money - also from this side of the Alpine Republic, the world is ravaged.
The Treasury of Swiss banks has become a symbol of irresistible reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for specially high quality chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still fit into the cliché of a good Swiss private bank - it's just a little bigger.
The location is classic.
The bank is headquartered in the Bahnhofstraße in Curaçao, which leads directly to Lake Curaçao, which is framed by the snowy summits of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are wonderful, rental shops are among the highest in Europe.
Shoppers like Tiffany's can be found here among Swiss traditional shops like Sprüngli candy shops.
For centuries, it has been home to Swiss banks: from the Nationalbank to the Palais der Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
UBS enters the reception hall with heavy swivel doors.
Inside are walls covered with marble, in front of them are huge leather chairs, next to the bank logo a large direction to the "safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
The Swiss bank’s idea, however, has sometimes been suppressed or betrayed by both Swiss large banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds out.
He would rather not read his name in the newspapers, but eventually closes, like all Swiss bankers, shops with both major banks.
UBS has probably grown too much, he finds – especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have expanded.
The Swiss have nothing to say about it.
"And if they had, they would have long adapted to the Anglo-Saxon ways."
Indeed, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, which brought it high profits at first and then a disaster: no European financial institution lost as much money in the jungle around Subprime as the Swiss Grossbank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster was obvious.
“On Wednesday, the government coalition of a small seven million-year-old nation committed itself to the largest rescue event in its nation’s history,” writes author Lukas Hässig in his book Der UBS-Crash.
Up to 68 billion francs, or about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>45 billion, have been approved by politicians to save the bankruptcy bank.
How could that have happened?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, you see the problem primarily in UBS size.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss banks merged into a giant group.
A bank was created, which was already too large for small Switzerland at the time of the merger - and continued to grow.
The two different UBS banking predecessors helped to complement each other: One rich but sleepy bank in Zurich with a focus on wealth management and poorer, but more internationally involved.
All of a sudden, internationalized investment bankers benefited from a lot of money, with which they could spin a big roulette.
With this rise, UBS has two names: Peter Wuffli, UBS Group CEO from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
“I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were the team of the future,” says banking expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffly, the highly intelligent, the modest, who knows a lot about models and statistics, and Ospel, the man who controls the feelings around the stomach, who has been working up from the banking sciences."
But Ospel was said to have relied on Wuffli in the end.
And in the end, Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: “He thought his models were real,” says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
It is clear that pride preceded the fall.
UBS employees clearly remember the memoirs of executives, at which CEO Wuffli repeatedly repeated the same motto: Drop Goldman Sachs from the throne.
The U.S. Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She mentioned "League Tables", a director who documented the success of the banks of that time.
In it, UBS tried to place it all the way up.
She has already taken a few steps.
In the trading of currencies and shares, she participated in the games quite up.
Entrepreneurial advisers who have been entrusted, however, emphasize one weakness: In international interest trading, in the speech of bankers "Fixed Income", there is probably a big gap behind the largest banks.
UBS may have gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS committed itself to an adventure that almost cost her existence.
Hungry after growth, the bank invested both itself and its Risk Guarantee Fund in U.S. Subprime investments.
It evolved into a huge machine that overcame securities into U.S. mortgage loans and passed on – but also risking itself.
Also, when other banks long ago were looking for a starting point.
“In the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was in flames, UBS bought it there,” says banking expert Geiger.
The greater the euphoria, the deeper the fall.
One manager had to leave after the other when cleaning attempts were more difficult than thought.
The positions at UBS have become catapult seats and are sliding to this day.
Who runs a big bank now, has an almost unmanageable job.
They need to find a strategy for the bank that all the close business models have disappeared.
Banking expert Geiger already has an idea: the end of investment banking, the focus on asset management, the return to Swiss roots.
The bank doesn’t want to go that far (yet).
But investment banking is going to be very down, so much is clear now.
Next Thursday, the new head of the bank, Sergio Ermotti, will present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Swiss Italian was only understood as a transitional solution when the bank surprisingly broke up with its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he has been conducting UBS’s trades in the long run, the Cury bank said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to put the investment bank back in the mid-1990s.
3,500 seats cut.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who's she?
What does he want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is asking himself now.
But so far in public, he only says that he will find an apartment in Zurich with his wife in the first place.
Next year.
Fear of a recession in Europe weighs the stock market in the United States.
The threatening recession in Europe has freed U.S. investors from the courage to start the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome did not achieve the intended impact.
The depleted production of industry on the Continent sunk in the seed of hope for a stabilization of the debt crisis.
The general facilitation of the exchange of governments in Rome and Athens was not possible.
The euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glasses last week were still considered half full, not half empty — but now they’ve gotten into trouble again, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
In particular, the financial values were on sale tickets.
The Dow-Jones Standard Value Index recorded a 0.6 percent drop at 12,078 points when trading ended.
In the course of trading, the kmital barometer market between 12,027 and 12,170 points.
The width of the S&P-500-Index ended at 1251 points, a 1% decline.
The Nasdaq Technology Exchange Index lost 0.8 percent and went off trading with 2657 points.
In Frankfurt, Dax said goodbye with a 1.2 percent drop at 5985 readers.
Industry in 17 euro-using countries has significantly reduced its production and is preparing to end the spread.
In September, the companies produced two percent less than in the previous month, according to Eurostat.
"We're not an island, we're dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will probably not recover from the recession so quickly, and there are other signs of bank weakness.
Investing legend Warren Buffett just confirmed this outlook: He said in a CNBC interview that it will probably not be clear yet whether Europe is strong enough to do anything to end the crisis.
That is why it is probably too early in his view to invest in European state loans or banks.
Instead, Buffett abandoned the decades-old principle and entered the American technology industry.
His more than <0x24>10 billion investment in IBM boosted the stock price of the traditional group and allowed it to go against the trend in the course of trading by almost one percent higher.
The paper ended up almost unchanged at <0x24>187.35.
Buffett paid an average of <0x24>170 per piece and now holds 5.5 percent.
His investment firm Berkshire Hathaway's share price dropped 1.3 percent.

At Nasdaq, 1.38 billion 630 shares ended in sales with an increase, a decline in 1913 and 82 unchanged.
Intelligent holes are expanding in cities
In many places, the hawks of the field are considered "problem birds": However, these highly intelligent animals cannot be ejected from the cities for a long time, experts say.
Some like them, others would like to get rid of them quite quickly: The holes have been part of the image of the city for centuries, yet in some municipalities there is a accumulation of complaints of the inhabitants about the impurity and noise caused by animals.
However, there is no remedy against “problem birds” yet under supervision.
The havrany fields may no longer be ejected from the cities, experts at the first symposium on the mines in East Africa’s Leer said.
There, experts from all over the federal territory consulted on possible departures.
Searching for alternatives in cities
Nature conservationists have also deduced the problems of cities from the exodus of particularly protected field shrubs: the use of chemistry in agriculture is about to destroy traditional areas for life.
Persecution, growing construction, and cutting typical trees for nestling birds make life difficult.
The gates are protected.
Large colonies with more than 600 nestling pairs are located, among others, in Westphalian Soest, in the northwest, among others, in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen and Leer.
There, in 2005, the controversial project of mass killing of corals in the rural district triggered a negative title.
Critics have labeled the capture of animals in the bird feed and the slaughter of claws as particularly brutal.
"Normal expulsion, fear, nothing brings," said urbanist and landscaper Werner Klöver from Leerer.
Removing nests by spraying water or cutting trees often has undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"Animals are retreating, large colonies are dispersed and scattered elsewhere."
Fear is only possible as an exception in hospitals, pensioners’ homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them away anymore."
Without the surrounding territory, the problem of cities cannot be solved, according to Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
It is conceivable to combine the expulsion of animals from sensitive residential areas and their attraction to settle elsewhere.
"Information boards instead of chainsaws" in contrast, the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens advocated for a completely different treatment of animals: "A single skull in the face can ultimately best stop with self-confidence."
Mrs. Jürgens co-founded the Ascherberg-Schleswig-Holstein scientific crane path, which provides information boards on the life of a highly intelligent field shark.
In the meantime, the project has already been accepted by tourists.
Mrs. Jürgens also criticised the noise caused by birds: "This is about every volume of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: Field Havrans do not only use help to reach the Pampelune, but even make their instrument as a help.
Researchers at the University of Cambridge have recently tested behavior on four field hawks as to how far bird intelligence reaches.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that the rocks had to bring down the structure in order to get to the larvae of the mole.
Without a great training, they knew what size and shape the stone must have to cause the platform to collapse.
In the second attempt, the lubricated wrinkles then had to solve a lighter problem.
In the vertical cylinder, the researchers placed a small container with molar larvae.
Birds were not able to reach their destination.
However, the researchers put pieces of wire there.
Of these, all four animals formed a hook, with the help of which they hunted the vessel from the tube behind the holder.
Three out of four field havrans even managed to do so with an intersection.
Cristiano Ronaldo to shoot Portugal at the 2012 European Championships
The hopes of Bosnians and Turks did not go out for the cup.
Favorites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will participate in the 2012 European Championships.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland won the last tickets to the 2012 European Championships in Poland and Ukraine in the Play-off matches.
Led by double-successful superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal defeated Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made a perfect fifth in a row after a 0-0 result in the first game.
In the play-off with the outsider Montenegro, the Czechs had a score of 1:0 (0:0) when the first game was clear.
Croatia didn't even score with 0-0 against Turkey, Ireland scored a free 1-1 (1-0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th), Helder Postig (72th, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored another goal for Portugal.
A former Wolfsburg professional from the Bundesliga Zvjezdan Misimovic transformed by penalty (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) twice reduced for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic received a yellow-red card (54th).
Bosnia has already been disappointed in the play-off matches for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa with Portugal.
At the Stadium da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal made a peaceable start.
Ronaldo soon reached the lead by hanging a free dome from about 30 meters into the net.
On a good quarter-hour later, Nani showed his qualities in long distance shooting and adjusted to 2:0 with a hit from 25 meters.
The Bosnians, who failed in the first half of the hour, had their first clear chance at Edina Dzek’s goalkeeper.
Former Wolfsburu player from England at the top of the table at Manchester City placed the main ball on the lower edge of the armpit, but the ball did not exceed the goal line (33).
Jiracek scores for Czech Republic
In the end, Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding was at the center.
After an action against Helder Postig in the Bosnian criminal territory, Stark decided for Schwalbe and awarded the Portuguese a yellow card.
On the opposite side, Stark carried out a controversial criminal coup after the action of Fabio Coentra, which Misimovic certainly transformed.
But after the break everything was clarified by the 2004 European Vice-Chairman with four hits.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also finished in the 81st minute with the final doubts.
With this, the Champion of Europe from 1976 will leave for the fifth time in a row at the European Championships.
The team of coach Michal Bilk with Bundesliga legionary Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg) were also lucky and had to overcome a terrible second already in the initial stage.
Branká<0xC5><0x99> Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech has prevented the last minute reflexively the possible own brank of Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Sivok (9.).
Montenegro had its biggest chances when duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot in the 40th minute from a turn from the border of the criminal territory just around the <0xC4><0x8C>ech gate.
After the break, the crossing had to save the place of the already knocked world-class Czech goalkeeper, again lowered by the attacker FC Seoul (50.).
Bryan finally clarified everything just before the end.
At the time, Turkey missed a football miracle from Zagreb.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not exceed the 0-0 state.
While national coach Guus Hiddink is almost certain to have his place on the third bench at the 2002 World Cup, Croatians are allowed to enjoy their fourth participation in the final round of the European Championship.
In front of 31,000 spectators at Maximilian Stadium, the Turks are expected to experience an almost fairytale start.
Selcuk Inan hit in the seventh minute with only a shot from a distance, and the attacker Kazim was also unable to hang the reflected ball in the fire.
After this horrific second, however, Croatia took control more and more.
Even after the break the Croatians did not get the gate.
In addition to Mario Mandzukice from VfL Wolfsburg, who released Dortmund Ivan Perisice from the 62nd minute, there were still legionaries from the Bundesliga Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt).
Trapattoni to go to the European Championships
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first participation at the 1988 European Championships in Germany.
Stephen Ward brought the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who managed to score 4-0 in the first game on a preliminary decision, in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) scored for the guests.
Ireland set the pace from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy had a good first chance.
It was only at the last minute that the Estonian defense prevented a possible leader of the brand.
But in the 32nd minute it was quite far away.
After the unsuccessful defense of goalkeeper Pavlo Londak, Ward was in place and pushed the ball over the line to a 1-0 position.

SAP wants to double the number of its employees in China.
The largest software manufacturer in Europe, SAP, is investing billions in China over the next few years and wants to almost double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, it will be worth about <0x24>2 billion (about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.5 billion), Dax said on Tuesday.
“We will create further R&D facilities and hire the relevant staff,” said Bill McDermott, the representative of the company at the Beijing Customer Fair.
The company is now growing from its current 2,500 employees to 4,500.
The number of branches of the world’s leading software for enterprises doubles from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
Approximately 4,000 of the world’s more than 176,000 SAP customers are experiencing a boom in the country.
China’s growth plans are also an important building block of Dax Group’s strategy for 2015.
SAP wants to increase its turnover to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 billion by 2015.
Last year, Walldorf received approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>12.5 billion.
Currently, the software manufacturer, which employs 55,000 people worldwide, is in business, as well as almost never before.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"Now we would like to expand our activities (...)," McDermott said.
“Our goal is, with the support of extensive research, to promote sustainable growth in China.”
Massacre on a personal level
Peter Englund’s emotionally powerful new book, The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War (The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War), starts with a long list of emerging characters that turns your head off.
One tip on how to behave at this point: Carefully remove this page and make it a bookmark.
You will get to know all the people in Mr. Englund's novel story very well, and this list will serve as a navigation - like a lighthouse - at times when, like men and women in the story, you will feel confused and lost in different situations.
Mr Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new deputy to the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.
The book we are discussing here is very unusual - the author himself describes it, quite well, as an "anti-historical work".
It contains several very well-known names, important treaties or famous battles, on the contrary it almost lacks ambassadors, energetic journalists and discussions on tactics and equipment.
It is not even a book about what happened, the author explains, as rather a "book about what it was". It is mainly about "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and Sadness" combines the war experiences of 20 more less fat men and women, on both sides of the barricade, from students and botanists to hikers, doctors, rescue drivers and officials.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Others become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go crazy, or die.
Their lives fade like the flames of candles lit in the church - new ones are added to the grid of destiny, while others are extinguished.
Mr. Englund's book is different from classic historical novels.
He's changing the idea that World War I was only about the horrific backlashes on the Western Front.
"Beauty and Sadness" explores skillfully other places where war dramas took place: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Soldiers in this book solve the problems by falling on them a bee nest, having to spend Christmas in the shadow of the pyramids, or face the presence of the mouse tse-tse.
Almost from the beginning it is a very impressive reading.
The war will devour people's lives like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina smelling of gunpowder.
When the shooting starts in the distance and you are a woman who is at home with your children, will you flee or stay?
Who's approaching this?
Almost no one understands what’s going on, not even why the whole war was started.
"The vacuum created by the lack of facts," Mr. Englund observed, "was filled with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, prejudices, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and flames."
"Beauty and Sadness" follows the stories of individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young naval officer serving in the German fleet.
Their stories are universally taken from biographies, letters and other materials that have already been published.
Descriptions of their lives can sound scary and captivating, but thanks to the integration of tiny moments and details, they are completely alive and credible.
Many of them talk about suffering and dealing with it.
In the story of a German student, the author says, "Scratches, substitutes everywhere."
"Coffee maker, aluminum imitation, rubber imitation, paper bindings, wooden buttons."
He goes further and describes food substitutes in Germany.
It refers to "mass made of molten rice cooked in spoon fat (and supplemented with a fake wooden bone), tobacco from dried roots and dried potato poles, shoe with wooden socks".
It mentions that there were "837 registered meat substitutes in the production of parches and 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honor and courage.
An American finds in himself an inner whip of wildness and brutality, stating of war: "Finally you will understand that this is human nature. Don't sit in comfortable chairs with cigarettes and whiskeys."Not in front of civilizations, not in front of the tabloids and in front of your bar or in front of the bar.
On the contrary, the British soldier realizes that he is most likely to die soon, and no one will even notice that he is sad.
“When a person finally reconciles with sacrificing, he would at least expect that to happen in the eyes of a grateful audience,” he writes.
Instead, he feels like a “defendant who he secretly hangs.”
Other remarks relate to the departure of old Europe and the emergence of new horrors.
"Conflict has become increasingly an economic competition and a competitive struggle," writes Mr Englund, "a war between factories."
He captured what he calls "a new kind of beast of the coming century: an expressive and ideologically engaging mass murderer in custom-made dresses, who performs his bloodshed without getting up from the table."
People behave completely unexpectedly, subtlety is replaced by heroism.
Mr. Englund also describes soldiers who deliberately attempted to catch a sexual disease from prostitutes in order to avoid service on the front.
“The biggest example of this behavior was the trafficking of gonococcal pus, which soldiers bought and smeared their genitals in hopes of ending up in the hospital,” he writes.
"The most desperate people even saw it in their eyes, which often blinded them to the end of their lives."
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund's prose is fresh, but not shown, which fits perfectly with his human theme.
In dozens of small outputs, he captures the way the war "dissolved absolutely unmanageable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are forced to fight.
The best books about the First World War were mostly written with hints, such as "The First World War and Modern Memories" by Paul Fussel or novels like "On the Western Front of Peace" by Erich Marie Remarque.
Mr. Englund prefers the unconventional concept.
His book has the most conspicuous endings in popular scientific literature.
But I won't tell you.
But you will feel as if the author suddenly jumped out of the book, pulled the page out of your hand and burned it.
After the previous mistake, this time for a minute, the exact schedule
Hundreds of police officers participated in the incident, some in helmets used in street riots.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because Zuccotti Park was supposed to be almost empty at the time.
No one knew about the action except a few high-ranking officers. The others were told at first that this was an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, whose presence emphasized the number of problems the police department had to face during the operation, was in the lead.
The cases of recent weeks, for example, where pepper sprays were used against protesters, were not allowed to repeat, violating the rules of the department and the public’s sympathy wave shifted to the squatters’ side.
Therefore, the police operation, which aimed to clear Zuccotti Park from the protesters, was started only after two weeks of careful planning and exercise.
Leaders were inspired by the operations that took place in other cities.
Massive exercises for the case of behavior in crisis situations took place in the Randalls Island part, which was in preparation for an event in Zuccotti Park.
Leaders have reinforced so-called riot-repression training—anti-terrorist measures involving the rapid transfer of a large number of police officers—focused on the urban part of Lower Manhattan.
The last part of the training took place on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders to move to the park came literally "at the last minute", declared someone to whom the action was originally only explained as "exercises".
"I know a few police officers who were also called to the event, and no one has definitely told them that he is going to Zuccotti Park," the person who spoke only on condition that he remains anonymous.
"Only the highest-ranking members of the department knew about going to Zuccotti Park."
One of the reasons for the secrecy was the lesson that the city had once received.
On October 14, the city officials were to clear the park plan, but then retreated from the plan, because as soon as the protesters heard about it, hundreds of them gathered in the park before the operation began.
Tuesday’s event was attended by police from various units, including intervention groups from all over the area – dozens of police officers who are commonly used to reinforce a neighborhood with higher levels of crime.
Mr. Kelly explained that during the day, a large number of people come and go to the park again, so an hour at night was the ideal time to start the event.
"It was appropriate to do it at a time when there were as few people in the park as possible," he said.
Before the units left, on the borders of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, were trucks of emergency units with arc lamps and amplitudes.
The lights and the recorded message from the amplifiers frightened many protesters.
When members of the order units entered the park in their blue winds, many protesters packed their belongings and left.
Police say she didn’t touch a single apartment until 1:45 a.m., so she wanted to give the protesters time to pack things up.
Other teams of police officers were seen gathering at the edge of the park so they could enter it if there was a need to carry out any arrests.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Chief Police Department spokesman Paul J. Browne said this was the case for their safety.
However, many journalists believe that the police wanted to prevent them from seeing their units in action, and in addition, some police officers were cruel to them.
Mr. Browne claimed that TV cars on Church Street leading along the park's western border could be filmed without any problems.
The police marched westwards and flew through a dense confusion of protesters’ personal belongings, including luggage and jelly bags full of clothes, followed by teams from the hygiene department, who immediately collected everything that was left in the park.
Some protesters who refused to move were pulled out of the park, and documentary footage appeared shortly afterwards on the internet.
The most ruthless group of protesters retreated to the nearest kitchen in their campground, which was located near the center of the park.
Some have set up a lockdown and the police have started their methodological arrest.
About ten people in the center of the camp joined each other.
And two people tied to the tree, Mr. Kelly said.
Members of the Emergency Services were called to cut the locks.
There were no arrests in the park until 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The whole operation was completed about 75 minutes later, the police said.
Mr Browne said about 142 people were detained in the park.
Most of the arrests were due to "organizing raids and putting resistance in custody," he explained.
The highest-ranking police officer on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the commander of the police department, the highest-ranked uniform officer on the department.
The operation was also personally attended by Phil T. Pulaski, the chief of detectives in the department.
Mr. Kelly was present, but "he was not involved in the operation management," Mr. Browne said.
A second group of police officers awaited along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case it needed to be called.
On Cortlandt Street, block north of the park, and on Pine Street, block south of the park, locks were erected.
From these places, the police developed a protective belt even further away from Zuccotti Park.
At one point, police officers were spotted, many of whom were equipped with shields, pushing people further beyond this border.
There were about 28 people on the northern border.
The wildest events of the night took place south of the park.
At about 5:00 a.m., a protester south of Pine Street was spotted jumping on the hood of a police car, and several others were ejecting air from the tires of the police van.
In a moment, a piece of glue flew out of the crowd.
At the end of the operation, one policeman and one protester were hospitalized.
The union of auxiliary workers will sue the city for the release
Trade unions representing hundreds of school assistants who lost their jobs last month are planning to sue the city on Wednesday. They claim that the dismissal was not necessary and also was discrimination due to the disproportionate impact on the schools they attend.
The case-law is probably the last option that the District Council 37 trade unions have left in their attempt to reverse the dismissal decision.
On October 7, six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parental coordinators and other employees, who were among the city’s worst-paid employees, lost their jobs. Their dismissal of the city’s employees, who were described by the leaders of the unions as a health-care compensation for the city’s damages, not as a compensation for the city’s damages.
City officials have categorically rejected this accusation.
At a city council meeting last month, Education Minister Dennis M. Walcott said the dismissal was part of the budget approved in June.
One of the members of the board immediately checked that the budget did not specifically mention the dismissal of auxiliary workers.
District Council 37 officials have announced that they have already filled out the necessary documents and warned the Ministry of Education that they will sue it. On Wednesday, they are convening a press conference where they will formally announce the summit to the Supreme State Court in Manhattan.
The defendants will be Mr Walcott and the Ministry of Education, while the defendant will be eight dismissed workers, all of whom are African-Americans or Hispanics, as well as most other assistants who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city's legal department, said the city had not yet seen the lawsuit, and therefore will not comment on individual charges.
According to a complaint proposed by the New York Times, the trade unions focused on the amounts released in the poor parts of the city, thereby supporting their claims of unfair conduct, because they remain the opinion of the poor, the wealthy, the wealthy, and the poor, the poor, the poor, the rich, the poor, the poor, the poor, the poor, the poor, the poor, the poor, the poor, the rich, the poor, the poor, the poor, the poor, the poor, the poor, the poor.
They point to the fact that while schools in Staten Island were not allowed at all, and at least in Upper East Side, in Brooklyn, in District 23 in Brownsville, 17 school assistants were lost, and in District 8 and 9, in South Bronx, there were even 46 students who lost their jobs.
She recalls that at Public School 36 in Harlem, five out of eight assistants lost their jobs, although it is a school where 68 percent of students live in poverty. The lawsuit says, "It's not a neighborhood full of mobile parents who can get financial support."
Public School 36’s budget was reduced by 3.26% this year, and the school also lost money as the city changed the way to calculate bonus funds for each registered poor student.
Trade unions, among other things, claim that high school directors may have been confused in the manner in which a document was written approving the dismissal of parental coordinators.
In the document, the word "excess" was used to describe the action, i.e. to cancel the position, although this word is much more often used to describe the transfer of the teacher from the school paycheck to the database of available workers, whose salary is paid by the central authority.
"Sixty-six parental coordinators have been released," the complaint said, "and not just moved to the database to the position of available workers."
The mission is over, Congress is ready to adopt an agreement on the situation in Libya
Finally, Republicans and Democrats in Congress seem to agree on something about the uprising in Libya.
But before this happened, the revolution had to succeed, long-running dictator Muammar Gaddafi had to be captured and killed, and the participation of United States units was terminated.
On Tuesday, the Senate's International Relations Commission will decide on a statement backed by President John Kerry (Mass.) together with Senators John McCain (Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.), in which it should congratulate the United Nations and "congratulations to Libyans on their commitments."
“With this statement, we want to appreciate the courage of the Libyans who started to rebuild their country,” Kerry said.
"Both sides of the political spectrum would like to express their support for their democratic endeavours."
These sentences may seem innocent, but no debate on Libya has been so far an easy one.
Over the summer, lawmakers from both sides have been constantly arguing with each other and with the White House about the drafting of a series of statements to approve or, on the contrary, reject the US military role in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution allowing the limited use of U.S. armed forces in Libya.
The motion was rejected in the House because of differences of opinions between the two political parties, so it was never voted in the Senate.
However, the same day that the House rejected the proposal, the House also rejected measures to stop the financing of US operations in Libya.
The U.S. mission in Libya was literally in the legislature - Congress was criticizing the way President Obama runs the mission, but its members obviously didn't irritate it enough to stop supporting him in his act.
The hesitation of the congress eventually preceded further events.
In August, the rebels captured Tripolis and on October 20, Gaddafi was killed.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The International Relations Commission, in its statement, "congratulations to the Libyan people for their immense courage and admirable resilience in their efforts to liberate their people" and "congratulations to the professional men and women of the armed forces of the United States, to the operas and to the allies of the United States."
The statement also "affirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new proposal be fully supported by the Commission on International Relations, or will the legislators be again divided into two halves, as was the case with the adoption of the June proposal?
The last version was opposed by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), the main representative of the Republican Party in the commission.
Lugaro's spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new proposal.
The House will vote this week on an amendment to the Constitution that would require a balanced budget, which should be the highest legislative priority for almost all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This measure, enacted by Bob Goodlat (Va.), will be the first amendment to the Constitution concerning the budget or any other subject on which the whole House or Senate will vote.
The other legislators have not yet succeeded in pushing their proposals until the vote itself, despite considerable efforts.
Goodlatt’s proposal is just one of the 68 amendments to the Constitution that were presented in Congress and touched on a wide range of different topics.
Some of them were the same - the same proposal submitted to the House and the Senate - and others are just minor changes to others.
Only in the House can be found at least 15 versions of the amendment on a balanced budget and another handful that would like to "regulate federal expenditure".
Some of the proposals are the same, but their supporters - especially the novice Republicans who want to improve their reputation - can boast of their "authority".
The revenue on budget regulation, which was approved in August, required Parliament and Senate to vote on the amendment to the balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding declaration in favour of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, several members also want to discuss the limits on the number of periods that members of Congress may serve, while José E. Serrano (N.Y.) wants to increase the number of periods that may be in office as president.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) offered a range of supplements that would, among other things, guarantee the right to quality education and medical care.
The permanent proposal remains the supplement prohibiting same-sex marriages and the supplement prohibiting the burning of the state flag.
Some lawmakers also want to allow federal laws to be repealed if two-thirds of states oppose them.
Although members of Congress seem to be very active in proposing various additions, they do not significantly deviate from the average when compared to previous flights.
In the 111st Congress, they offered 77 amendments, while in the 100th Congress there were 66.
Their activity even fades compared to the early 1990s, when, according to the statistics of the Senate Library, members offered more than 150 supplements every two years.
However, they were not much more successful than current politicians.
The last amendment that was added - the 27th amendment - was ratified in 1992, however in fact it was proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Crazy, but not defeated," Gifford said in her first TV interview since the shooting.
Ten months after she was shot by a shooter from close proximity at a public meeting with voters in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffords (Ariz.) appeared on state-wide television on Monday night, sung a staircase about her, along with a melody for the Broadway to-show, and a melody for the "To Comemor" show.
Giffords appeared on the "20/20" show on ABC News with Diane Sawyer. It was seen that writing poetry was still making her trouble and she needed help while walking.
The whole show documented her difficult reconvalescence, which was necessary due to a bullet injury that pierced her front skull, penetrated her left half brain, and out of her head behind.
Three months ago, she returned surprisingly to the House to participate triumphantly in the debt ceiling vote.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, in which six people were killed and 13 others were injured, Giffords smiled, laughed, and sang - describing her recovery as "difficult".
When Sawyer asked her how she was feeling, Giffords, aged forty-one, replied, "Very well."
An interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hourly special of the show "20/20", which was broadcast on the eve of the couple's new book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope".
The special monitored the entire Gifford Reconvalescence since the January 8 shooting.
In the video that Kelly filmed during the first week, Giffords is seen in a hospital bed with her head erupted and a long rib across her forehead.
While her husband encourages her, she can’t do more than just raise one or two fingers at the time.
A few months later, Giffords is captured sitting in a wheelchair and therapists teach her how to perform simple activities.
Screaming head.
Lip swelling.
And then, her first word: "What."
Within a few days, Giffords uttered another word - "toast" when she demanded changes to her breakfast.
Videos broadcast by ABC show that Giffords played a key role in recovering music: The congresswoman sings along with the melody therapist to the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Fallin" by Tom Petty.
During an interview with Gifford, who spends two hours a day on therapy, Sawyer revealed that she does not remember anything from the day the shooting took place.
Her husband said Gifford had read newspaper articles about the shooting until March 12, when he was first asked who she was the sixteen who was killed in the incident.
The shooting is suspected Jared Lee Loughner, who is detained in a Missouri prison where under the influence of violently administered drugs await trial.
"A lot of people died," said Giffords Sawyer.
"Awful, awful, awful."
Kelly Sawyer revealed that at one point, his wife during the convalescence declared, "I lost."
"So I said to her right away, Gabby, you didn't lose," Kelly described.
"You just got the charger.
But you'll manage it, you'll get together and you'll come back stronger than ever before."
Military units meet with compassion rather than with respect.
The event was a gala dinner on Wall Street, which spent millions of dollars on veterans of war in New York who had no roof over their heads.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about powerlessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines ran around him.
The crowd, dressed in solemnity, stood up and pressed with enthusiasm.
"Men and women serving in the army were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the spring benefit.
In addition to Admiral Mike Mullen, who saw the role of the military units in a slightly different way, the then chairman of the committee of chiefs of staff took part in the ceremony.
“Everyone was portrayed as orphans,” the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers thought it well.
I know you do.
But what I saw wasn't respect, it was regret.
Thus, completely opposite impressions only illustrate the insidious relationship between the army and the often measured, sometimes celebrating American public.
The army is incessantly encompassed with praise for its victims.
But this praise is worth something, the soldiers say.
The public is acting more and more as if the individual in the uniform is regretting.
"We're not victims at all," Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led troops in Iraq, said in a statement.
“But it seems that the only way some people can support us is to put us into the role of unhappy souls.”
This topic is very sensitive for military commanders who do not want to look ungrateful or spoil their relations with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger faced by units returning once from Vietnam was much worse.
As a result, most of the words about regret are conveyed in silence and in private among war veterans.
When two sons of retired Colonel Mark Canciano returned from combat where they served as members of the Marine Corps, their father warned them that outside the army would look at their service from two angles.
From the point of view of some will feel respect and amazement because they defeated the enemy insurgents and visited exotic places.
Others, however, will dig their heads if "a bad, violent veteran is not hiding under the surface," said Cancian, who was involved in the fights in Iraq and took a seat in the Washington government after his return.
He claimed that when he was looking for a job, some of the people who interviewed him inadvertently indicated whether he could withstand the stress associated with working in Washington as soon as he returned to the fight.
"When you talk about your service, you have to count on negative reactions," Cancian taught his sons.
The concern of the army is partly due to American indifference to wars.
Success in the battlefield is rarely recognized in a country that has little knowledge of its own army, and in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan there is little self-promotion.
“As a nation, we no longer consider military heroism as it used to be during World War II,” said Lieutenant-General David Barno, who led U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, recognition by politicians and the public focuses primarily on the suffering of men in arms.
Soldiers are rewarded for the number of actions they have undergone, the number of friends they have lost, or the extent of their injuries.
The military is facing growing pressure to take a hard stand against rape.
This week, it will be decided whether to open a trial of 28 women and men against the army for alleged inaction in the case of rape.
If not, hundreds of other applicants are ready to file a lawsuit.
The first-class soldier, Elizabeth Lyman, was reportedly raped by her military colleague at the age of 25 and was 11 weeks pregnant.
It happened in October 2008 and she was headed to the barracks at Miramar Air Base north of San Diego. After dinner with a friend she encountered her male colleague carrying a box of 12 beers.
He asked her if she could join her, so she could have a drink in her room.
“I had a warning light in my head,” Lyman said.
But the native Texasan completely ignored her objections.
I thought, "No, he's 19."
"He's from Texas," she said.
"If I were to listen to my instincts."
He claims that just a few minutes after they entered her room, the man went to her, threw her in bed and raped her.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other existing or former members of the army will be waiting for a verdict hearing that could have a historical impact. This will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and it will be about whether the charges against Donald, Gafeles, and his ex-minister, Robert Rude, will be met.
The indictment said Gates and Rumsfeld had failed in the fight against the spread of rape in the army, which is contrary to the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The indictment was filed in February by Washington lawmaker Susan Burke and the plaintiff had 17 members at the time, but in the following months, the number of women and three men who claimed to have been raped, raped, raped or otherwise sexually assaulted has increased to 28-25.
Burke claims that he's going after the highest-ranking commanders of the army, because the problem begins with them.
“The military is a directive system,” he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to prevent attempts to impose measures against such acts?"
Burke also claims that she has contacted at least 400 other survivors since February, many of whom could become part of further lawsuits filed in the future.
Her strategy: rather than bringing all the charges together in this case – she put all the eggs in one basket, as she says herself – she is bringing complaints in several different cases, if necessary, so that the pressure does not ease.
The defense team is led by U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride, who, together with his colleagues, urged the case to be rejected.
The court documents obtained by Newsweek detail the defense strategy - in principle, current or former soldiers cannot sue the army for injuries suffered as members of the armed forces.
According to the 1950 Supreme Court order called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for the injuries suffered by soldiers in active service.
"The alleged injuries concern the military service of the plaintiffs," the document said.
The Ministry of Defence declined to comment on the matter.
But things have changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still not officially allowed to serve in combat, it is only a slogan: in modern wars it is difficult to find a clear frontline.
In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers have played an increasingly significant role, especially in communicating with civilian women in the war zone.
The result: 150 female soldiers fell between these wars - two-thirds of them directly in combat.
It is time for modernization to take place even in the army, Burke explains.
She's not alone in her fight, she's also dealing with three other lawyers.
At Yale Law School, attendees of the veteran legal services seminar are preparing a lawsuit against four major military academies for allegedly developing an atmosphere that promotes hatred for women.
Independently, the non-profit organization of American Vietnamese veterans collects evidence for their lawsuit against the army. This lawsuit focuses on the diagnosis of "personality violations" that were allegedly detected by the victim of rape. The victim of the rape is a victim of the crime. The Army is a victim of the crime.
In December, her group filed a lawsuit against the state organization for dealing with veterans, which she accuses of discriminatory practices that were supposed to occur when processing requests for help from persons who claimed to have been sexually assaulted in service.
Nine separate proposals were presented in Congress, presented by a group of senators and MPs from both political parties and proposed a number of corrective measures.
According to the Office for the Prevention and Treatment of Sexual Violence, 3,158 sexual assaults were reported in 2010.
However, this type of attack remains unreported in most cases, and according to the Pentagon’s own estimates, this figure corresponds to about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred in the year.
The March report also dismisses the criminal prosecution rate of the suspects: In 2010, 20 percent of the cases reported in the military were brought to court - half of which is against the civil justice system.
Prosecutors in the case of Deputy Burke describe the attacks as the first of a series of traumas.
For example, Lyman reported the alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it was supposed to happen.
During the night, she said, she was asked to repeat details of her rape eleven times to different policemen, doctors and commanders.
She underwent all the tests necessary to determine the rape and found the blood of the attacker in her bed - from the wound she had done on his arm.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman went to trial, during which she was asked whether she was in love with her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six people were summoned, who witnessed the rumors in favor of the alleged offender, who was eventually released.
"I remember the day the verdict was made," says Lyman.
"I had the feeling that I was giving birth right there - with a scream I ran out of the courtroom."
"They put me in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember telling my commanding officer, 'It wasn't his court. It was mine.'
The Lymans ordered a visit to a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, denoting her as unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was released from the military without honor and therefore without any claim to service.
Whether the case of Lyman and other prosecutors is moving to the next stage or not, it’s a long-running run, says John Turley, a professor of law at George Washington University.
However, he notes, "From my point of view, they should be able to move to the next stages of negotiation."
But between them and the verdict is the doctrine mentioned, which has been criticized from the very first moment that the light of the world was seen.
I am a lifelong critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The army is back for decades because their duties do not give them the same degree of motivation and discouragement.
He adds: "The odds are hard against them... but it's important for them to try it."
Change will only happen if good people are willing to fight.
Unless the hearing is decided in their favour, Burkevoá, the lawyer of the plaintiffs, will gather hundreds of other people ready to file a lawsuit and start working on other cases on the subject.
"We will not stop fighting with the army on this issue where there is no reform," he said.
Or until we die, depending on what's coming sooner.
Walls Have Eyes: How Scientists Are Investigating You on Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, he was just another young man who presented his anti-immigrant views on the Internet.
On Monday, Braivik, who confessed to July’s murder, after which 77 people were killed in Norway, attended his first public hearing.
Although Breivik could act alone, he was definitely not alone in cyberspace: during the preparation of the attack, he spent a lot of time at the computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists supporting the right-wing group on social media sites.
After the tragedy of this summer, scientists want to learn more about these people.
But how to find them?
It's easy - just go on Facebook.
“We have realized that getting them is not that difficult at all,” says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent British research team’s report on European digital populism.
The stock of personal information on Facebook is so extensive, Bartlett says, that it was enough for scientists to simply use ads on websites and, thanks to that, to determine the demographic group they were looking for – something that marketing workers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team across Europe found half a million fans of right-wing groups, focusing on them and sending them ads. But instead of inviting them to their newly-formed groups or offering them some food products, inviting them, inviting them to invite them.
Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues managed to get results from more than 10,000 fans from 14 different right-wing groups in 11 European countries – without having to leave the office at all.
“It’s a completely new way of conducting research,” says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not so surprising: online right-wing supporters are a whole lot of young men who are pushed by an increasing immigration rate.
But on the other hand, “those who combine their online activism with offline activism are smarter, more democratic and less violent than those who remain constantly hidden behind a computer screen.”
The DEMOS team’s work is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, health scientists, and political researchers use these pages to study everything from health problems to social trends covering updating conditions, wall posts and pressed "Like" buttons.
Facebook reports more than 800 million active users. Each of them provides an average of three different data per day, which literally makes this social network a "information supernova", which is worth developing many new research states. The number of academic works 800%, in which the name of Facebook will be mentioned.
For some scientists, the magic of Facebook is that it gives them the opportunity to study people without having to bother them somewhere on the street.
"It used to be that if you wanted to conduct a survey of people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
“You should go to a party where you would never be left,” says Bartlett.
“Facebook is doing all of this – you’re just going straight to them.”
Others claim that the site can offer a way to identify and avoid a social-health problem.
In a recent study by Dr. Megan Moren of the University of Wisconsin, the research team found that university students who were discussing their drunken performances on Facebook were much more at risk of the problem of alcoholism than students who were silent on the subject.
Morena suggests that the peers of the student site monitor and come up with an offer to help the student, which publishes too many drunken statuses.
"The problem can't be solved unless you can't diagnose it," said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Dr. Morena and director of the Center for Children's Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle.
"We found a way to identify endangered children that we wouldn't have a chance to discover."
Facebook is constantly scanning the data of its users.
The information team of the pages developed statistics related to the relational status and Valentine’s Day, the election participation in 2010 and the national satisfaction coefficient (mainly with the use of the information to which they had access - the Internet freedom of speech supporters should have long been informed by the public that it would have been a long time ago.
But Facebook users know that the page is watching them, whether they like it or not – in exchange for the opportunity to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the page needs to provide their personal information.
But what if Facebook users become part of a research they don’t even know about?
Scientists have clearly defined rules on how to collect data offline, but on-line data is available to everyone.
“I don’t think most users even thought that scientists could look at their profiles,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, about a 2006 study he conducted using his students’ public Facebook walls.
"When it came to them, they took it as if the information was only between them and their friends."
It is also important to consider the question of methodology.
Even when researching offline, there is no guarantee that the subject is completely honest.
There is no way on Facebook to verify how much profile information and wall posts are true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” Selwyn explains.
That is why Selwin, who has spent many years researching new technologies, believes that pencil and pencil are still the best possible tool that can be used in research.
“When you go out into the real world and talk to real people, it’s something that can’t be replaced,” he says.
“Social research should be about society and social activities – and damn a lot of social activities are still taking place offline.”
"Cold and Inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik attends his first public trial
Anders Behring Breivik, a man who confessed to committing two attacks, during which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, described himself as a "reflective" fighter during his first public hearing in Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian Resistance Movement and among Norwegian Templar Knights," he said in a court meeting of 500 people.
"I object to the court because you have been mandated by organizations that support hate ideology and because they support multiculturalism."
"I admit to my actions, but I do not admit to any guilt for them."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because "he did not want to give Breivik an opportunity to use this hearing as a stage on which he could express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who had brought with him a prepared speech, to contact the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, banned him from any contact with the media for four months, and announced that the competent authorities would have full control over all his visits and visits for eight weeks.
Approximately 30 relatives and survivors attended the hearing.
Some came in the hope that they would be able to look Breivik in the eye, others to make sure he was held firmly under the lock.
All of them participated to move the case to an early closure.
"I thought it looked cold and inhuman," one of the survivors told the NRK commentator.
"It was nothing pleasant, but I can say for myself that after I saw and heard the suspect, I moved a little further mentally."
Breivik, in a dark suit and a blue tie, remained quiet and professional throughout the hearing. When arriving and leaving the building with no difficulty looking to the present journalists even the survivors in the eye.
Despite Breivik’s bizarre notion that he was part of a larger “resistance” movement, the judge said he was not insane, and noted that there was no evidence that he would have any accomplices.
It can be comforting to anyone that the June 22 attacks seem to be the work of a single extremist, not a radical group.
However, this does not automatically reduce the sadness and confusion that are still in the minds and hearts of the whole nation.
"I wish it would look like a monster, but it's not," said one of the victims' relatives.
"If it were, it would be a lot easier."
7 lessons from a Lost Interview with Steve Jobs in a Movie Going to Cinema This Week
When Steve Jobs died on October 5, the opinions of people comparing him to Henry Ford began to emerge – and he was chosen as his genius the Greatest Modern Inventor.
At the recently rediscovered Jobs interview, which was screened for a special film that is heading to theaters this week, it will be for all Apple fans the fact that his creative mind has fully understood the business processes and workflows behind his products.
He was an amazing designer, dreamer and self-proclaimed member of the hippie movement, but also a pedantic organizer and a person who fits every detail into the smallest detail - he believed that many entrepreneurs suffer from "the idea of the prodigy is a great idea and a great idea is a 90 percent of their prodigy.
In 1995, Bob Cringely worked on the TV show Triumf of Computer Crazy, which talked about the dawn of personal computers. During the filming, there was a unique, more than an hour-long conversation.
It was ten years since Jobs was forced to leave Apple, and he had a full-fledged job with his new computer company NeXT, and he looked forward to seeing how the general public would accept the internet.
In the end, only a short part of Cringely’s entire interview was used on the TV show, and the original copies of the interview were traded that they were lost during the transfer.
Shortly after Jobs' death, however, VHS copies were found in the director's garage.
It’s this material, slightly shrill, that forms the basis of the 68-minute Steve Jobs: Lost Interview, which is heading to selected movies this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who has been renowned for his reluctance to provide longer interviews, Jobs is here surprisingly excited to be able to talk about his technological philosophy and business strategies.
And it also turns out to be a very thoughtful person.
Four times during the interview, there will be a longer pause between the question and the answer - 10 to 15 seconds of thinking, when you see how Jobs perfectly thinks about the answer, to be as accurate and as accurate as possible.
There are also moments when Jobs’ perfectionism comes to the surface, when Cringely’s questions are impatient and pushes him to get to more important problems and topics faster.
The interview was shot before the era of Pixar, iPod, or iPhone, and it reveals terribly prophetic ideas as Jobs assesses what other companies are doing well and badly, offering his own vision of the future in the field of computer technology.
One thing is to read the posthumous evaluation of Jobs’ career, but on Jobs, which we see here as a breathtaking dream in the bloom of his genius, is something raw and inspiring.
He has his own vision of what things might and should look like.
It didn’t take long, and after he expressed his thoughts, he also began to put them into practice.
A quick summary of the seven scenes from Lost Interview that are definitely worth noting:
How to learn how to manage a business:
“During the years of business, I always asked myself, ‘Why are you doing this?’ and the answer was always the same: ‘Well, this is how it’s done.’”
No one knows why he’s doing what he’s doing, he never thinks deeply about things related to business.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues by describing his effort to simplify accounting at Apple.
He was completely confused by the way the costs were recorded - often started with the inscription "standard costs", their amount could only be thought of. At that moment he decided to go his own way - he developed an automatic tool, which ensured that the commercial costs could be handled.
How he made a roast for the Pope:
Jobs recalls the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak, a device that enabled people to effectively dig into a phone company and make free calls anywhere in the world.
There has been a lot of writing about the device in the past, but Jobs’ enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as a tool of power is literally contagious.
He tells how he and Wozniak tested the device using a paid phone and were allowed to switch from one AT&T network to another during a call, while using as many satellites as possible.
“We’ve been flying around the world like this at least half a dozen times, so when we yelled at a paid phone, it sounded a minute later from the second phone at the door,” Jobs laughs.
“We were young, and we found that we could build things that are capable of managing billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world.”
The two of us made a little thing that was able to control a much larger turn - it was an incredible experience and I think Apple would never have come up without it.
Jobs continues by describing a joke that they and Wozniak almost reached the end. Through the Blue Box in the middle of the night, they called to the Vatican and asked if they could talk to the Pope, as best they could for Henry Kissinger.
Gradually, members of the Catholic Church were summoned to speak with the American diplomat in the middle of the night, and just before the pope woke up to the phone, the couple shook their heads and laid down the headphones.
How he fell in love with technology (and phoned Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 years old and he was looking for spare parts to build a kilometer, he found a number on Bill Hewlett's phone list and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute interview, Jobs already had a secured summer brigade at Hewlett-Packard.
"It was the only company I knew at the time, and it shaped my view of what this company really is and how it should treat its employees."
Jobs later became one of HP’s employees who visited the company’s research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw “the first desktop computer ever made.”
He was big like a suitcase, he had a CRT monitor and I immediately fell in love with him.
As a teenager, I went up and down at HP, swam around the computer and started writing programs for him.
How Innovation Invents:
In several places during the interview, Jobs talks about how he invents new products on the run.
At the beginning of his career, when he went out to sell a couple of boards with board connections, one customer asked him to build a whole computer for him.
He had only 30 paid days available, during which he had to invent, assemble and deliver the finished equipment.
When he was later at Apple, he recalled the problems he encountered during the development of a computer mouse:
"I remember how we were arguing pretty wildly... they yelled at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost <0x24>300] until I stopped having fun, I went out and found a designer."
Ninety days later, we were able to produce a perfectly reliable mouse for <0x24>15.
How big companies are breathing:
Long before leading Apple’s re-establishment, Jobs was persuasively predicting that many industry leaders would be stalling and losing their market share in their vision.
“Let’s say you’re working with IBM or Xerox, so you’re doing better copiers or printers, so what’s next?”
You have a monopoly on the market, so a company can no longer be more successful.
At this point, the sales and marketing are already in place, so companies are being run by people who are in charge of this, while people who are in charge of their own products are out of the decision-making process.
The technological genius that led the company to its indestructible position is now replaced by people who have no idea of good or bad products - skills and technical knowledge are necessary.
This is exactly what happened at Xerox.
Xerox could have literally owned the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times bigger than it is, it could have been Microsoft in the 1990s.
Instead of winning, they made up for losing.
How innovation takes as a form of art:
"There is still a long way to go between a great idea and a great result product and a lot of work... and how this great idea evolves, changes and grows."
During that time, you will learn a lot about him.
You have to agree on a number of compromises - certain things just electrons, glass, robots or factories will not make you do.
You have to keep 5,000 things in mind – different concepts – and put them together.
In the end, it depends on the taste - you try to think of the best things that humanity has ever created, and in some way try to reflect on what you are doing yourself.
Picasso said good artists copy, but the best artists steal.
I've never been ashamed to have stolen the best ideas.
Macintosh was so amazing and successful because the people who worked in it were excellent musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, and at the same time the best computer experts in the world.
Without computers and new technologies, they’d be able to do amazing things in completely different industries.
Scalia and Thomas had dinner with opponents of the Healthcare Act at a time when their case was handled by the court.
On the day when the Supreme Court sat behind closed doors to discuss a politically controversial question of whether to accept an objection to President Obama’s Health Care Act, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, will be attending the ceremony.
The event took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the proposals put forward.
One of the cases discussed was the lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging the radical reform of health care that Congress passed last year, a law that mobilized conservative activists around the world.
The judges agreed to hear the lawsuit, but a 5.5-hour hearing is expected in March, the result of which will further develop the presidential election, which is scheduled for 2012 and will be in full force at the time of the decision.
The lawyer who will appear before the court and try to find the denial of the law will most likely be Paul Clement, who served as the U.S. Attorney General under George W. Bush’s administration.
Clement’s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, which has been engaged in the defense of conservative legal principles for many years.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the law-breaking business associations, the so-called National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, for which huge funds are at stake in the process.
The dinner was held at the Washington hotel a few hours after a court hearing on the case.
She also attended, among others, Mitch McConnell, the highest representative of Republicans in the Senate and a confirmed opponent of the Healthcare Act.
What about mentioning guests? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: These two judges have been participating in the actions of the Federalist Society for years.
And it’s definitely not anything that goes against the rules of ethics.
In fact, these judges are relieved of the obligation to observe the principles of conduct to which lower federal judges are subject.
If it were not, however, their conduct would certainly fall under principle C4, which states that "the judge may take part in actions which are being organised by the related and other organizations in order to obtain funds, but the judge may not be a speaker, an honest guest, or a programmer if he is not allowed to be in attendance."
However, the relationship between Scalia and Thomas with two law firms acting in the case, as well as companies with a huge financial interest in the case, was rich enough to alarm activists calling for ethics in the government.
“This shocking violation of ethics and indifference to the code of conduct is contrary to the claim by several judges that the Supreme Court behaves according to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
“The judges drank and dined for social benefits together with the legal representatives waiting to hear their case before the court.”
Their presence and assistance in obtaining funds through this action undermines all claims of distrust, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little understanding of their critics and told them that they also seamlessly combine their judicial duties with the actions of groups such as the Federalist Society.
Thomas’s wife Ginni is a highly regarded conservative activist.
In addition, conservatives argue that the ethical problem is mainly with Judge Elena Kagan and not Scalia with Thomas.
Kagan worked as a prosecutor-general for President Obama’s administration when the first objections to the law appeared before the court.
Critics of Kagan are pressuring her to refuse to participate in the case, claiming that she was fighting for the law as much as she could now be unchallenged.
Kagan didn't say she was going to resign.
Boeing wins record order for <0x24>18 billion in power jets
Emirates is ordering 50 two-seat Boeing 777 jets with the possibility of buying another 20.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Aman Air, for which it collects more than <0x24>1 billion.
When a company receives an order for 50 pieces of its products, it’s usually no reason to celebrate.
However, if that airline is Boeing Co. and the price of these 50 aircraft totals a record <0x24>18 billion, that’s something else.
Equally important news is where Boeing got the contract: the Middle East, the expanding gold mine for future aircraft orders.
According to a forecast released on Monday, the Chicago airline estimates that airlines in the Middle East will need <0x24>450 billion in the next 20 years.
Boeing has announced its biggest order in history for the dollar value of commercial jets - 50 two-stroke Boeing 777s - on the weekend.
The sentencing order came from the Emirates airline based in Dubai.
At the 2011 Dubai Air Show, Boeing announced that airlines will be able to purchase another 20 aircraft, bringing the total value of the order to <0x24>26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing announced that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, sometimes referred to as the Dreamliner, which are proud of significantly better fuel consumption and passenger equipment.
The total cost of these six aircraft exceeds <0x24>1 billion.
"This is an excellent report for the entire Boeing company," said Neal Dihora, an analyst for Morningstar.
"The quality of these particular customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East belong to local oil mining nations.
This means that they have not only money to pay for aircraft, but an increase in fuel prices - mostly damaging to airlines, because it is one of its biggest costs - is not so decisive, because the country itself is earning higher oil prices.
This is important because they are not as likely as other airlines to cancel or postpone airline orders due to rising fuel prices, says Dihora.
"They have such natural protection," he says.
The order from Emirates strengthens Boeing’s leading position in the broad-body aircraft market and brings it to the narrow airline Airbus SAS, which wanted to try to disrupt Boeing’s dominance with its A350 transport model.
Boeing's victory comes four months after Airbus representatives announced that the first flight of their largest A350, which is a direct competitor to the 777-300ER, would be postponed.
The displacement was due to customers demanding a higher payload of the aircraft and the flight, so the manufacturer took the time to be able to supply the engine with more engine power.
The share price of Boeing Co rose 1.5% to <0x24>67.94.
Mexican President’s Sister Was Defeated in Michoacán Elections
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that her opponent, Faust Vallejon of PRI, was helped by drug dealers in the pursuit of the governor's chair.
Sister Felipe Calderon appears to have lost her position as governor in Michoacán in a violent state election, saying on Monday that one of her opponents had been helped by drug traffickers.
The preliminary results were attributed to the leadership in the governorate election of the western state, Faust Vallejo, by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
“The interference of members of organized crime in the entire electoral process and especially in the election itself yesterday is alarming not only for Michoacán, but for our country as a whole,” said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview the day after Sunday’s election.
"They threatened our candidates, the members of the public opinion survey group... they entertained election urns, they built roadblocks... and they let people vote for the PRI.
The PRI party ruled Mexico for seven decades until 2000, when the presidency was lost.
However, it is planning an early return to power and winning the Michoacán election is an important step in this effort.
The PRI party hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have defeated Calderon, who led the election the day before, only very closely.
Calderon, a candidate for her brother’s Conservative Party National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejon as the winner.
In the third place was Silvano Aureolis, a candidate for the left-wing Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which had so far controlled the government office. For the controversial and badly persecuted party, the presidential election in 2012 is a very unhappy one.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results as valid.
Vallejo, a former mayor of the state capital, Morelia, rejects any relationship with drug traffickers and calls on other candidates to recognize the results.
Michoacán has long been controlled by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is the home state of President Calderon and it was in Michoacán that a military fight against traffickers began in December 2006.
However, the violence persisted.
The mayor of PAN, Luisa Marie Calderon, was assassinated just a week before the election and many of the candidates resigned out of fear.
However, no matter what the results of the Michoacán elections look like for the PRI party, winning the party will help to gain a new impulse.
The expected representative of the PRI party in the presidential election, Enrique Pena Nieto, of Wahington Vallejo, congratulated and said, "I think this victory could be very encouraging in view of the coming year."
ADB Bank calls on Asia to help save the Eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has called on India and China to be prepared to help save the eurozone from its severe debt crisis, otherwise the global economy could fall, which would also have a negative impact on Asia’s growth.
Rajat Nag, Managing Director of the Manila-based ADB Bank, said the two world’s fastest-growing economies must “do everything in their power” to help the monetary bloc recover rapidly through the International Monetary Fund, or direct exchange rates.
He warned that the Bric [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries are watching all European problems "too unwaveringly" and said that Asian financial aid combined with European leadership and funds will help fuel a long-term economic collapse.
"We're all in it together."
“So it’s okay for anyone who could help Europe out of the crisis,” he told the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
“Asia may be protected to some extent, but it’s definitely not immune.”
"So if China and India can help, they should definitely do it."
The European Monetary Union has been facing a serious debt crisis for several months now.
In recent days, Italy’s lease costs have increased dangerously and the Italian and Greek governments have resigned.
The growing debt crisis in Europe has raised fears that the global economy could pull back into a recession, and calls for a newly flourishing front-line economies to unite and help the Eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that all Asian support would be directed through the IMF, but noted that bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of bonds from the European Union Financial Aid Fund, the European Financial Stability Institution - would give Asian partners of European countries greater opportunities.
Anand Sharma, India's trade minister, said "India will do what it can" to help the Eurozone, because its own economy is now suffering from a decline in exports and a drought in the flow of foreign capital.
“No one wants the Eurozone to remain unstable and restless,” he said.
“We are facing a difficult task and we need to maintain a high level of growth.”
“It’s not an alternative, it’s a bare fact, because otherwise we could find jobs for tens of millions of our young men and women.”
Others argue that developing economies, such as the Indian one, have nothing to help European economies when they are forced to face their own serious economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically very difficult to explain aid for Europe to 1.2 billion Indians, when 800 million of them live from <0x24>2 a day or less.
"One thing they might find is that the Greeks are retired at fifty and enjoying their holidays on the beaches, which would probably be hard to explain," he said.
Lee Howell, Director General of the World Economic Forum, similarly questioned why Indian stockpiles should be used to maintain well-paid jobs for many Greek citizens in poorly managed and losing sectors such as rail transport.
Mr Nag stressed that the eurozone crisis is threatening a "dangerous domain effect".
The bank's forecast that Asia will grow by 7.5% between 2011/2012 is now facing a "risk of decline" due to the European threat.
He said vulnerable developing markets must create “plans of unpredictable spending” to be protected from the decline and significant influx of capital from their economies.
Warnings from the Pentagon about possible defensive cuts
Defence Minister Leon Panetta on Monday, in Congress, has properly placed under the boiler, warning that sweeping automatic budget cuts could jeopardize national security and trigger a financial chain reaction starting in the Pentagon and continuing through the civil battlefields in Mongolia and Afghanistan.
The Pentagon will already have to spend a budget cut of <0x24>450 billion over the next ten years, but now fears a cut of another <0x24>600 billion if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
"The effects of these cuts would be devastating for the entire resort," Panetta wrote in a letter to senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that Congress’s inability to reach a budget agreement and the resulting so-called suspension would cause a 23% flat-rate decline and the halt of many new projects.
"Due to such a huge reduction, used in this substantive way, it will not be possible to carry out most of our construction or ship projects - you can not buy only three-quarters of buildings or ships. In addition, there could be serious damage to the."
"We will also be forced to separate many of our civilian employees, and since the reduction is to take place so quickly, we will also almost certainly have to send civilians on forced leave in order to be able to meet the target requirements."
“These changes can shake the faith of those who take care of our army and seriously damage its readiness.”
Eventually, the cuts will also affect combat units, Panetta said.
"While the accounts for financing possible war operations overseas will not directly affect this stop, the operations there will be adversely affected by serious changes in other budgets," Panetta warned.
"There will also be cuts in contract staff, which will result in delays in the contracts agreed to support the war effort of our people."
"The status of paid employees will be reduced, resulting in delayed payments to suppliers and subsequent violations of legal and political support."
Both senators rejected Panetto ten days ago and asked him for details regarding possible impacts on automatic cuts to the Ministry of Defense.
"The consequences of the stoppage on the Department of Defense could cause a rapid degradation of the view of the United States as a world military power."
"We are strictly against this harsh measure," the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon, when they published Panett's letter.
"It's not a conclusion we could live with, and we definitely don't want to sign under it."
"The planned cuts are a threat to the national security of the United States, which we should not allow."
“First, we will see whether Panett’s letter and fresh warnings will increase pressure on Congress to approve the budget and strengthen votes calling for the Pentagon to be removed from the list of demarcated areas.
Panetta has been more and more open in talks about possible cuts lately, though he himself has moved to his senior position in the Pentagon with years of experience with budget approval in Congress and the White House, so he knows that he'll just get to the point.
At a press conference held a minute a week, the Minister of Defence indicated a brief picture of what his resort can expect - a shell of the army, but inside which the core will be missing.
"It'll be like a ship without sailors."
"It'll be like a brigade without ammunition."
"It'll be like an air force without trained pilots."
"It will be like a paper tiger, like an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers who could complete the mission," Panetta said at the beginning of a speech in the Pentagon.
"It will be like a unit without morality, unprepared and unable to deal with a possible enemy."
"As a result, he will welcome aggression..."
In an annex to McCain and Graham Panetta, it specifies how the reduction will result in "significant operational risks: delayed responses to crises, conflicts and disasters; significant limitations on the possibilities of landings and deployments around the world; anticipated unacceptable risks of future operas."
Panetta added that some of the biggest defense projects could be expected to be completed, including those that are already tested, and those that are only in the early stages of planning.
The list included, for example, the project of the F35, the planned new bomber, the new generation of ballistic submarines, the new coastal battleship and the new ground combat vehicle, with which the army and the navy wanted to replace the humvee.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 would save <0x24>80 billion over the next ten years, but its supporters claim it is a necessary further step in improving the army, which is necessary for the country to deal with potential threats and other threats from China.
How to recognize a lie
A slow look at recent newspaper headlines predicts how serious and omnipresent lies and deceptions are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is full of hands on charges of sexually harassing several women – both sides claim the other is lying.
Administrators at Penn State University were accused of false testimony as they tried to hide records of a retired football coach sexually assaulting the boy.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was approached as he told US President Barack Obama with a microphone that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie has been able to destroy entire careers and block the stability of many countries.
New York congressman and internet exhibitor Anthony Weiner made himself a fool when he published information that was immediately evaporated by unquestionable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of abusing funds from his campaign to try to conceal his unmarried relationship.
And no one will ever forget the media circus that ran around Bill Clinton when he lied during his second term in office about his sexual affair with Monica Lewin.
Everywhere there are stories of cheating at school and university.
There are cases where teachers themselves give their students test answers just to make them look good in their assessments.
Mentors, who should teach the opposite, send a message that lies and fraud are acceptable.
How many frauds are we facing?
Studies show that in a single day, you’re going somewhere between 10 and 200 cases.
Let’s assume that many of them are merciful lies.
Another study showed that foreign people in the first ten minutes of their first encounter in their lives slapped three times.
Determining a lie, or “recognizing a lie,” is a necessary skill that everyone should learn, whether for personal or professional reasons.
However, it is not a social game that would be similar, let's say, to Sharad, when one shouts, "I have you." The recognition of deception is a serious sector of science working with the psycho-data collected during the last six decades of the philosophical projects, and then from the past decade to the past.
One of the results of the research is that most of the old myths about lies have been erased.
Liars are looking in your eyes.
It's not that they're holding back, they're cocktails, they're reddening or they're barking.
However, don’t assume that it’s somehow difficult to detect and uncover lies.
A trained lie identifier can reveal the truth from the May building, tiny expressions in the face, the way questions are created and their timing.
I’ve spent several years accumulating scientific knowledge from a broad and evolving field of lie recognition, and it’s clear that discovering lies is a modern skill that can be easily learned by learning, and in today’s complex world, it can help you.
Good liars are able to read well in others, letting them be beaten with caution, directing their emotions, and intuitively realizing how the other party accepts them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more often than introverts that men tolerate more "medium" lies, while women say more lies "focused on others" - mostly to protect feelings - that married people lie to their partners (more often than their own).
We also know that if you are perceived as a sinner, others feel less guilty when they lie to you.
How do you know someone's lying?
First, look at the normal behavior of the subject.
It's called "beginning observation."
Thanks to him, he will have a later finding of what to compare with.
Notice the attitude of the subject's body, his laughter, the work with his voice.
You should know if someone is regularly flipping their legs so that they are not unjustly accused of lying just because they start flipping their legs in the middle of the meeting.
Then try to determine the clusters of false verbal and nonverbal behavior.
However, take it only as a warning signal, not as proof of a lie.
People who are lying can stop moving the upper half of the body when they are trying to remember their fictional story, the tip of the boots can turn to the door, bend to the east, significantly change the posture of the body, or manifest a "left-handedness" after a breakdown.
People who perform interviews often give a false signal that the interview is at an end, just to see what the relief will look like after it ends.
Feel the subject’s language as well.
Famous is the story of how Scott Peterson once crossed and used the past when he claimed that his murdered wife was alive, which sparked a nationwide search for her body.
Liaring individuals can also express themselves fairly: “I haven’t had any sexual relationship with that lady...Mrs. Lewins” or repeat a difficult question.
The most common verbal characters are just very insignificant.
Someone can use a lot of "silent language" when they answer a difficult question: "Well...to tell the truth...of what I know...in my best consciousness."
In such a response, we will not learn too much facts and it is often a further warning signal.
There is no magic by which every lie can be revealed, but it is possible to acquire the skills by which a lie can be revealed.
With these skills, a person will be more likely to be a liar and a fraudster in his personal and professional life.
The controversial plan for the construction of the oil pipeline will be redirected after a threat of postponement of approval by the U.S. government emerged.
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to postpone the approval of the planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico - which has sparked trade unions against itself, but has calmed environmentalists - the company is building a pipeline to take care of it, announcing that it is willing to override the project.
TransCanada announced on Monday evening that it would move the planned pipeline route from the Sandhills ecologically sensitive area of Nebraska, and is confident that the project will still be approved.
The company announced this decision at a press conference at the Nebraska government headquarters.
TransCanada columnist Alex Pourbax says the company is convinced that the pipeline will eventually be approved, although it will lead a different route.
This announcement came after the foreign ministry last week announced that it was postponing a decision on a federal approval of the project, from which it would not conduct studies of possible replacement routes that would not interfere with the Sandhills area in Nebraska, and the water-resistant suburbs.
"This is really a move forward," Republican representative Lee Terry of Nebraska told Fox News.
The new environmental assessment commissioned by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would likely postpone any decision until 2013, i.e. a year after the next year’s elections, but authorities refuse to play a role in the decision.
In a written statement last week, Obama described the decision as a request by the Foreign Ministry and expressed his support for it.
The 1,700-mile pipeline will connect Canada and the Gulf of Mexico.
It supplies 700,000 barrels of oil a day from the state of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
This way, six states will have to pass.
This project is absolutely hated by environmentalists, but loved by the workforce, which estimates that 20,000 new jobs will be created while working on the pipeline.
Legislators in Nebraska, however, opposed this plan and were considering enacting laws that would force the company not to interfere in the Sand Hills region and the waterproof layer of Ogallala, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current environmental impact study commissioned by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found that the project would only have a small negative environmental impact, but a source from the energy industry said that the inspector-general from the Ministry had ordered a new review of the entire study process, and that the study was conducted.
One was whether lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was Hillary Clinton’s advisor in 2008, did not represent a conflict of interest in the program.
Furthermore, whether the company that was hired for the original study was not inappropriately selected because it had links to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is accused of being scared of her baby.
The New York family claims that singer Patti LaBelle ran furiously into the lobby of their Manhattan house and frightened their daughter so that she vomited out of fear.
Eighteen-month-old Genevieve Monk's performance of "Lady Marmalade" scared her so much that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased fear of strangers," her family said in a lawsuit to the Manhattan Supreme Court.
On November 10, last year, stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a schoolteacher, and Genevieve were preparing for a family trip.
When Kevin Monk landed the car, Roseanna Monk dropped her luggage down to the lobby of their house on Riverside Boulevard and carried Genevieve with her.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped at the door for a moment and the baby was lying down for a moment.
"Someone showed up behind my back and said, "You know what your daughter's doing?" I said "yes" and I went to pick her up."
LaBelle annoyed the pregnant woman.
“In an aggressive tone, she told me, ‘You shouldn’t put your daughter at the door,’” Roseanna Monk said.
"I told her, 'I don't care what you think.'
She got angry and began to speak loudly – screaming loudly the simplest expressions...
She had a bottle of water with her, and she started waiting for me.
She claims Genevieve had a hysterical seizure.
“I said to the woman, ‘Look at what you did to my daughter,’” said the child’s mother.
LaBelle threw herself at her mother, who was still Genevieve in her arms, and had to stop her until her companion, who subsequently pulled her into the waiting car, said Roseanna Monk.
In the meantime, the daughter was screaming so much that she vomited, she added.
Later, the family sent a letter asking LaBelle to apologize, but they did not get an answer.
LaBelle's lawyer and spokeswoman are not responding to our phone calls to express their cause.
The lawsuit calls for a more inaccurate compensation, but family attorney, Sam Davis, said the case was taken for free and that the family plans to donate all the money raised to a charitable organization dedicated to children with cancer.
“The goal is to force Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her actions,” Davis said.
"Such behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially if it is directed against a school teacher holding an eighteen-month-old child in his arms."
Climate change has slowed the economy
During the first year of the government, Maria López Valdez increased unemployment and unreliability in Sinaloa, decreased foreign investment and with them the economy
The year 2011 will be in the economic history of Sinaloa. This is the first year of the government of Maria López Valdez, which itself is called the government of change. This government has brought with it high expectations in terms of economic progress, however unprecedented after the disastrous economic downturns.
The low temperatures in February caused millions of losses in agriculture, reduced the potential for growth of the state economy, were aware of a 3.6% decrease in economic activity in the first half of this year. In the agriculture sector, there was a historical decline of 31.16%, which also disrupted the sector.
According to a report on the damages caused by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, the damages were recorded on 582,835 hectares of cultivated land, of which 78.03% were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07% were harvested and harvested.
According to the National Institute for Statistics and Geography, the rate of unemployment in the country has not declined until November, and in the first three quarters, the rate of unemployment has not increased, and in the first three quarters, the rate of unemployment has not increased, and in the first three quarters, the rate of unemployment has not increased, and in the first three quarters, the rate of unemployment has not increased.
Less liquidity
According to Gerard López Cervantese, Director of the UAS Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences, it is possible to explain the increase in unemployment indirectly, based on the steps taken at the level of public policy.
"We are witnessing increasing unemployment, which is related to various factors. These include loss of liquidity in the market due to resource constraints as a result of the legislation passed by the congress," they were not interested in investing in the fight against dirty money laundering.
Stopping the migration
López Cervantes said that a demographic factor is also involved in the increase in unemployment.
"The number of people who go to work abroad, to the United States, has decreased, both for reasons of difficult entry and also because even if these people get out of borders, it is difficult for them to get a job," he said.
Unreliability
The labour market analysis in Sinaloa is also deteriorating due to the growing unreliability that prevails in the field of working conditions. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Democracy, 60.38% of the employed population in the country is working without paying social security allowances.
Unemployment and unreliability are added to other features of the labour market, such as low wages. In this administrative territory there are the lowest wages from the whole country, according to the registries of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Planning.
The average monthly income of workers in the state of Sinaloa was 5,352 peseta as of September, well below the national average, which is 7,375 peseta.
Reduction of foreign direct investments
Along with the decline in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, the most significant decrease in foreign direct investment in the last 10 years was also recorded in 2011. According to the Ministry of Finance, in the period from January to June, the amount of foreign direct investment7 was upwards of 630,697 per annum, upwards of <0x24>147 per annum, upwards of <0x24>147 per annum.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Economic Development of the state government lists investments in the amount of 17,280 million pesetas per year. These investments were mainly aimed at companies in the service sector.
Dluh
In connection with the scenario of the decline of the economy, the government of this state requested the state congress in July to approve a loan of 3 billion pesos. This would be intended for investment in infrastructure projects in 18 urban areas in order to revive the economy. The local congress did not approve the sector of the state's newspapers, the economy of the newspapers, the economy of the newspapers, and the loan of 600 million pesos in a loan.
Reaction
According to representatives of the business sector, the first year of the government, Maria López Valdés pointed to a lack of government governance.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of Transformation Industries, said that in 2011 there was a lack of coordination of the will of individual sectors, including the state government itself.
"The growth of the economy in Sinaloa has been really negligible during this year. We have to work intensively to regain the land we lost this year. In 2012, we will have to double our efforts, we have to harmonize our efforts, we have not been able to do so in all of us and in all of us.
The slowdown in economics
Loredo López said that events like frosts at the beginning of the year stopped the state economy and curtailed its development and growth.
"The weak economic movement was caused by a number of events, including the freezing. One of the main consequences was the slowing down of the economy, which did not memorize quickly enough to be able to re-increase the dynamics, which would allow us to achieve an acceptable level of product through, and process movement.
Redefining the mission
According to Teodor Salazar Uriarte, president of the Mexican Confederation of Employers in Sinaloa, it is necessary to push the country towards more dynamic productive activities.
"We generally observe that it is working. We think it is necessary to prepare a long-term plan in which the goals and economic direction of the state would be redefined, because it is important to mobilize all the potential of material and human resources," he said.
The work that is ahead of us
President Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that would better govern government efforts.
"In general, I would say that the government has been trying to achieve good results in various areas, there have been some progress in economic development, but it is important to create a long-term plan," he said.
He said that the current administration has shown progress in governance of public policy.
"There are elements that make it possible to claim that the government is trying to be friendly. I can say that there is work done here and I think the government is aware that there is also a lot of work ahead of us," he said.
8 kg of marijuana
Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and a 100-day fine for holding eight pounds of marijuana.
The Attorney General of the Republic informed that the convicted dealer is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval. He was convicted of a health-threatening crime, specifically for holding marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was detained by members of the Mexican Army on June 7, 2010, during a raid on Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite station 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The dealer was in a pick up truck of white color. In the car in the shelf he had a black bag and a small bag on the passenger seat. The soldiers found 8 kilograms 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the secured man remained available to the Judges of the Second Division and the proceedings remain internal within the Centre for the Realisation of Legal Impacts of Crimes.
He owes contributions to projects
Social projects, which are part of programs such as Habitat, Rescue of Public Places and 3x1 for migrants, are facing the risk that they will not be completed or that they will have great delays due to lack of economic resources, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel López Miranda said.
The director of urban social development said that if construction work has gone ahead so far, now the state government will not be able to provide appropriate supplies that require funds of more than 11 million pesos for three programs.
He said that the total investment in these three programs is almost 50 million pesos. The state is 25%. By this time the funds for work were provided only by the Federation and the city, therefore it is possible that there will be delays in the implementation of the projects.
"They have to secure almost 12 million and although the year is already nearing the end, we have not got anything at all. And even though we should have gotten a part already in July," he said. "In order not to waste time, we started the projects and they continue very well, but I miss it."
He said last year, under the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the state failed to meet the relevant supplies, and therefore, at the beginning of the new period, the city had to apply for a loan in order to be able to pay more than 7 million which the state did not give them.
"The static thing happened to us already in the previous six-year period because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs went on. In order to get to the above-mentioned programs this year, we had to get funds to cover what the state did not finish," he said.
Despite the fact that there is a pledge by state officials regarding the transfer of these resources, he said that a request was sent to Armand Villarreal, the secretary of administration and finance, to expedite the procedure and the corresponding percentage arrived as soon as possible.
"They were supposed to give us <0x24>12 million and although the year is coming to an end, we haven't even gotten a peso yet."
Court approves ‘end of analogue broadcasting’ in Mexico in 2015
Replacement of analog signals with digital is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme State Court (SCJN) rejected the constitutional lawsuit filed by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the presidential decree, which seeks to speed up the so-called "off of analog signals" and implement it in 2015 instead of 2021.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the court, Juan Silva Meza, believed that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers when he issued a decree that outlined individual steps that would lead to the transition to terrestrial digital television.
As a result, the lawsuit filed by the Senate was rejected because a qualified majority of eight votes was not reached in order for the court to express the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the said decree, which thus remains in force.
The proposal of the judgment drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero proposes the possibility of declaring the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of all matters relating to radio and television is a matter that is reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel).
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the House of Representatives supported the constitutional dispute in an effort to fight the decree. Minister Sánchez Cordero accepted the demands and suspended the application of the decree and all the actions described therein leading to the transition to digitalization.
The ministerial meeting also decided to reject the complaint filed by the House of Representatives, without entering into the debate on the proposal, which is also in charge of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister stated that he did not identify with the arguments of the proposal in the sense that the federal executive could not structure by means of general standards measures to prepare the public administration.
“I don’t think that even if she did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body,” he recalled, recalling that planning public policy in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector belongs to the federal executive, who has a constitutional mandate to determine the direction of the state.
Replacement of analog signals with digital is one of the biggest changes the world has experienced in recent years. It is associated with better use of the radio spectrum, better quality of the signal and more channels.
He believes that delaying the change would mean delaying the benefits of digitalisation, which requires decisions in the public interest, because digitalisation has not only a technical dimension, but also "affects economic, social, political and national security issues".
As he stressed, these issues "require the operation of the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the state. It includes a range of competences that the Constitution entrusts to the government of the state".
He recalled that a number of countries around the world had already completed the transition to a digital system and did so through their governments, despite the fact that highly specialized technical authorities were available.
He said it was not possible for the government, by issuing an inconsistent decree, which to some extent interferes in the jurisdiction of the Congress, to introduce law-enforcement in the administration.
In Michoacán, the possibility of counting "voice by voice" is analyzed
According to data published by the PREP, the difference between the first and second places in the governor's election is less than 27 percent. 879 of the 6074 constituencies have not yet been counted.
The option of counting "vote-by-vote" appeared in this year's elections in Michoacán, where, according to data published by the Preliminary Elections Program (PREP) is the difference between the first and second seats in the governor's election of less than 27 per cent, and not more than 79 per cent of the votes.
In this context, President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute in Michoacán (IEM), María de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llandaral Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral body approved a series of measures that should harmonise local standards with the federal electoral reform.
As it will be recalled, Michoacán has not officially confirmed his political constitution, nor his State Electoral Code or the Law on Electoral Justice, because the State Congress has approved the reforms shortly before the state’s legal deadline for their entry into force, and the statutory deadline for their entry into force in that time is not yet expired.
On November 9, the Supreme State Court (SCJN) resolved a constitutional dispute initiated by the local legislature and declared the vote of the head of state in the matter of constitutional reforms "invalid and illegal" because it does not have the right to " neither approve nor veto".
Maria de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal replied to the question of the possibility of "vote-by-vote" counting that the approval of the relevant measures by the IEM General Council would make it possible for the local electoral authority to carry out both partial and total counting.
In this way, a partial count of votes, one or more electoral packages, will be able to be carried out under the following conditions: the election results do not agree; there is no record of the count of votes and calculation in the relevant box, or it is not made available by the chairman of the ballot box or by the chairman of the ballot box;
In addition, a total recount of votes in all polling stations will be possible if there is evidence that the difference between a potential election winner and a candidate in second place is less than or equal to one percentage point; each time the party meets at the beginning of the poll, the party meets and the poll is held at the beginning of the poll.
The total number of votes can also be recalculated if, after proper counting, it is found that the difference between the likely winner and the candidate in the second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, and also if there is an explicit request to be in the second place.
It should be noted that in this situation there is an election in Morelia, where according to PREP the difference between the first and second places is less than 0.16%, although 129 of the total 923 constituencies have not yet been counted.
His last will.
His ashes will be scattered in the mountains of Fire, the family confirmed.
The remains of pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés were transported on Sunday night to Saltillo, his hometown. On Monday there will be a ceremonial ceremony and a pilgrimage Mass.
According to the family, the last wish of the lieutenant colonel was that his ashes be dispersed in the mountains of Fire.
After receiving the highest honour, the Bacio Cortés family returned to the capital, Coahuila, on board a plane of the Mexican Air Force. The family and closest friends attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
At noon, the ash of the lieutenant colonel arrived in the chapel in the class of Nazario Ortiz Garza, where family and friends also came.
At 5:30 p.m., a farewell ceremony was held at the Saltillo Institute of Technology, organized by his former high school colleagues and members of the American football team, of which Felipe Bacio was also a member at the time of his graduation.
"He wanted to go back to Saltilla and his wish was that his ashes would be scattered in the mountains of Zapalinamé. That's what he always said to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
According to her, the lieutenant colonel fulfilled all his wishes, was at the top of his life, "he was a wonderful man, an extraordinary father, a son, a loving brother living for his family".
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo very young and attended the Air School of the Colegio del Aire in Zapopan, Jalisco.
Some didn’t believe it because they said he even drove a truck, but he always pursued his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio reminds him of him as a very good man, "he just came to Saltillo, the whole family wanted to see him, as when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
The young man even remembers that when he was seven years old, he went to Zapopan to promote his uncle, so he is convinced that he died in what he had most liked in his life: piloting an airplane.
They gave him their last goodbye.
With Felipe Bacio Cortés, Deputy Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, we said goodbye to all the honours that came to him to give up Governor Jorge Torres López, the citizens and the government of the state, the Mexican army through the Salkalite in the Sixth Military Zone, the sport of the Sall<0xC4><0x93>tl<0xC4><0x93>85, and the University of Techni<0xC4><0x8D>ka itself.
Bacio Cortés died in the past few days after the helicopter he was driving fell. Also on board was the secretary of the government, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six other people, all officials of the state.
At 6:05 p.m., the remains of the Saltillen family member Bacio Cortés (shadowed) arrived to be handed over to the Mexican Air Force, under Major Jaime Martinez, through a funeral service, to the space where the family, mother, husband, and daughter-in-law of the student, Cristina, were gathered.
Three abandoned dead bodies were found on Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the discovery, military officials presented 11 people who were detained in the area for crimes related to organized crime to the media.
The bodies of three men killed by a gunshot wound to different parts of the body and head were found on the abandoned shipyard of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place on a 1.5 kilometer road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the level of the area known as El Castillo.
People who moved in these places noticed that the cottage with beige-coffee fence had occasionally opened the door.
When they looked inside, from a distance of about three meters, they noticed the dead of three people, so they immediately alerted the competent authorities.
One of the people wore a yellow sports shirt and a dark cotton pants and was not a shoe. A man also lay next to him in a sports shirt with white stripes.
A few meters further there was the body of another person dressed in a red sports shirt and blue cotton pants.
All three lay face to face in the direction of the ground.
According to the data obtained at the site, all three people were likely murdered in another location because no ammunition was found.
On the fence of the cottage were found messages addressed by one group of organized crime and also a number of traces of bullets, both on the building and on the door.
11 suspects arrested in Cadereyta
The National Defence Secretary presented 11 people, including young people, who were members of a criminal group that operated mainly in the Cadereyta area and which is associated with kidnappings, murders, persecution and illegal burials.
Eight people were detained in the Los Alveros colony during their first attempt on November 11, and one detainee was released.
Three properties were secured and a mobile phone confirmed that they were members of a criminal group called "Los Zetas".
Another incident took place on November 12 at 6 p.m. Military personnel were on a hike in the Rancho Viejo area of Cadereyta when he noticed cars without a SVP and two people in it.
After stopping the car, they conducted a search and discovered one rifle, a cartridge and 18 cartridges.
Then, on November 13, at about 2:00 p.m., one of the accomplices in the La Fraud area was arrested, and when he saw the soldiers, he tried to escape.
They were charged with illegal burials in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be appointed on Wednesday.
Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with the Italian president tomorrow to present him a new government that will face a crisis that holds the country over the collapse of the economic catastrophe.
Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present him a new government that will face a crisis that holds the country over the collapse of the economic disaster and which has put the entire euro area in jeopardy.
The presidential palace issued a report announcing that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he can form a government.
It is expected to present a majority of technocrats to the government, although it is not yet clear when the new government will take power.
Monti said he would present to the president the results of his talks with political parties in an effort to form a government.
“I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in our country’s ability to overcome this difficult phase,” the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say that he would be able to form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles were overcome.
"The frame is now well marked," he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, in a much shorter time than usual, while Italy is trying to fight the political and financial crisis, which has led the debt to an unsustainable level.
The new administration, led by former European Commissioner Monti, has to approve a tough package of austerity measures required by European leaders, so that Italy's credibility can only be restored.
Due to market volatility, interest on Italian BTP bonds with a ten-year maturity exceeded the 7% threshold, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to apply for a bailout.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian employers’ organisation Confindustria, told reporters after a meeting with Monti: “We said we are very supportive of this government.”
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this frightening situation.
Monti’s hopes of success have increased considerably thanks to the support of the PDL’s Silvio Berlusconi, whose crisis forced him to resign on Saturday.
“We believe that Professor Monti’s efforts are intended for good results,” Angelina Alfano, the secretary of the centre-right party, told reporters.
The support of the PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because up to this point a number of its members have been opposed to the government with a technocratic majority composed by Monti.
Parliament's support
The new Monti government must have strong support from Parliament in order to promote unpopular austerity reforms.
Any hindrance or delay in a given effort could trigger a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian foreign banking association added to the pressure and warned that Monti’s failure could be a disaster.
Monti began talks on Monday with political parties, trade unions and entrepreneurial groups, youth and women’s organizations.
The round of talks will end on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by President Napolitan, who allowed a very rapid move in response to the crisis.
After a short fall from the end of last week, when it was already apparent that Berlusconi would resign, interest rates on Italian bonds have returned to the critical boundary, responding to uncertainty as to whether the new prime minister would succeed.
Rescuing Italy, whose public debt is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.8 trillion, would be beyond the scope of the euro area’s current financial reserves.
Monti said his government should stand in power until the next election, which is scheduled for 2013, despite general forecasts that say politicians only give him time to carry out reforms, and then declare early elections.
Monti said he would like to incorporate politics into his cabinet, but the big parties insist that this government should only be made up of experts to get Italy out of the hardships the country was getting into due to financial pressure.
Political sources have said that both sides’ distrust and disagreement complicate the attempt to include both political figures in the government.
Spaniards take part in international matches more often than Costa Ricans
Out of 22 Spanish footballers, 10 will exceed the limit of 50 international matches.
On the side of Kostarika, only one of the 22 called players reached the number 50 matches.
A huge contrast on Costa Rica's side when we compare 22 players from both countries who came together today in a friendly match at 15:05 at the National Stadium in San José.
While world and Europe champions, the number one FIFA monthly rating, have a wide range of A-class matches on their account, Costa Rica has only defender Michael Uman, who has played as the only one in 50 international matches.
This figure was reached last Friday at the Rommel Fernández Stadium against Panama (0-2).
Spanish footballers, who play in the Uttar Pradesh and in the strong clubs of the English First League, have over a year of intense activity in league championships and domestic cups and high-level matches within European cups such as the Champions League.
We must also add to the previous experience of the Spanish national team in the complicated elimination matches at the European and World Championships.
Costa Rican players, on the other hand, have very limited opportunities for foreign matches in the region. There is, for example, Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the largest number of foreign matches from the Spanish national team has on their account goalkeeper <0xC3><0x8D>ker Casillas, who last Saturday faced England (losing 0-1 in London) to former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarret with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play against Costa Rica today and win a new record for Spain - 127 international matches.
Xavi Hernández, Barcelona’s key player, has 106 matches on his account.
Casillas and Xavi were even officially announced by UEFA last week along with other Spanish players who have a hundred matches on their account, including the already mentioned Zubizarreta with 126 and Schalke midfielder Raúl González with 102.
Carles Puyol came close with 97 matches.
Following are Xabi Alonso at 91; Fernando Torres at 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both at 81; Andrés Iniesta at 62; Cesc Fábregas at 61; and David Silva at 53.
On the side of Kostarika and near Michael Uman move left wing Junior Díaz with 48 matches and goalkeeper Bryan Ruiz with 45.
In addition, only 5 have exceeded the limit of 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
Minimum number of matches.
With less than 30 matches in Spain are Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side with less than 30 games stands Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest did not exceed 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba has two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and <0xC3><0x93>lman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still waiting for their first match.
The best shooter in Spain is David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
On the Costa Rican side, Bryan Ruiz has the most interventions, nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.

"The road to Costa Rica is a dream that becomes a reality"
In an exclusive interview for Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the group is ready to offer one of the best concerts at the National Stadium next Sunday.
We have been waiting for more than 20 years, but the group itself ensures that the opportunity for them to play in Costa Rica is a dream come true.
This was said by the bassist and founding member Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively to Viva last week from Brazil.
The group is located on the South American continent as part of a tour to celebrate its 20th anniversary and will be on a unique stop in Central America on Sunday 20th.
This day will be performed at 19:30 at the National Stadium together with the angel group The X and national musicians from Las Robertas.
This is a sample of an interview, the entire transcript of which can be found on the La Nación website.
For your Costa Rican fans it is a dream come true. Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica. Do you realize what your fans are experiencing?
The journey to Costa Rica is also our dream, which becomes a reality.
In South and Central America, we are hardly the second time and the experience so far has been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once, on vacation. It's a wonderful country and I believe we'll be able to stay here for a few days.
So we are very happy to be able to bring you our music.
I ask myself, because they literally love the group here, fans are experiencing these days of preparation very intensively.
What do you say to your most ardent supporters?
Thank you for staying with us for so many years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry that it took us so long.
Some people already talk about the concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does it put more pressure on you?
Some of the biggest shows we’ve performed in the last 21 years have come up in the horizon of a few weeks.
We performed a few great shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that we got into shape for a concert in Costa Rica.
We are really looking forward to this concert.
We love this country, we love to serve, we love the jungle. For both activities Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its surfing waves?
We have a lot of surfer friends and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo. The waves here are incredible.
My friends ride surfing in Costa Rica or to Nicaragua, or to Mexico. These are the best surfing places. And so we learned about Costa Rica, through people who love surfing.
If we look at your tour, you have prepared a huge show with many songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we’ve never played here, we have no limitations that we can’t do.
We will try to perform our best show with a variety of songs. We will try to play a few songs from each album and introduce our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You will never repeat the repertoire.
- Why?
I think that's partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs we'll play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven’t played for a long time, we focus on them and we’re also surprised because we remember why we liked them so much and that we might have forgotten about them.
So the show is more interesting for us, and that's why I think it's more interesting for people as well.
This tour will celebrate 20 years of art tracks.
When you look back, is it hard to believe everything you have done?
Yeah, I'm sure.
First of all, I don't think any of us could have imagined that we would be in a big rock band and that we would stay in it for more than 20 years.
We are aware of how much we have been given and we are concerned that we can continue to play together.
We love each other and we love making music.
We’re lucky to be able to look at the places we’ve always wanted.
We couldn't have gotten better.
What did it mean to you that you were a significant part of the creation of the grunge genre?
It has always been an honor for us to be part of this group in which the greats themselves are represented.
The people from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
It is surprising that when a movement arises from a group of friends, it does not happen too often.
From time to time, a group is formed in a city, but it is much less common for five to ten groups to emerge from one city at a time.
We are proud of this and we are honoured to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we're still playing with some.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on tour. We are lucky that they are all our friends and we are honoured to be part of this movement that originated in Seattle.
It is also very unusual for a group like yours to stay together and still have the same members after those years.
Yes, the four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is much longer than the usual duration of the group.
I think, firstly, we are all lucky to be still in this world, and secondly, the fact that we are constantly interested in each other plays a role.
We are all close friends and, thanks to this, we have been able to open up musical paths that leave everyone sufficient freedom to experiment on their own.
We believe in each other, we value each other’s music, and I don’t think it could be better.
Your relationship with the word of glory has not been easy. However, thanks to your success, you can do what you like.
How do you find balance?
As we grew up, it was gradually becoming easier to find a balance.
We try not to go too far on tour, because it is very easy to fall into this trap of crowds and people who love our music.
When you realize that people came because of music, you remember that you have to respect music and what you gave it. You must not be robbed by being famous, rock stars. None of us really care about this.
How do you remember the next Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote great songs and at the beginning it was something great.
“We’ve been around as a band for three years and we never released an album until Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
It was very frustrating because it took so long. The most important thing is that even today we are friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us. When I listen to some other song, I'm not going to look at it like I would, and I remember it.
He was an incredible person and we miss him so much.
Las Robertas will be commissioned to start the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that that's why you chose them as previewers?
Yes, the production sent us videos with a few suggestions and we liked this group the most. That is why we are curious what Las Robertas offer live and must be very fun.
Why do you always change the words Yellow Ledbetter live?
That's the question about Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it, and I think he adds the first thing that strikes him.
Who influences you as a bassist?
A lot of people.
I'm first attacked by Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all night about bass tech I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep grunge even though it is no longer in fashion?
I think we've always felt a little bit apart from the word grunge.
When it comes to grunge, I imagine the bands I mentioned, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana, and all the others that were created at the same time, and if music is still the same today, it's a great thing, because it's the music that's in front of the Mudhoney band and it's worth playing.
At first, your music had a slightly cloudy character and now it’s more positive.
What is the value of this change?
That’s interesting because I feel like there’s a couple of tracks on the new album that are lighter to rank, but there’s also songs like The End or Juste Breathe that are considered very cloudy, although they may sound like positive.
At two o'clock, when Ed played it for me, I cried, and the songs are deeply dark.
I think when you grow up and you have some trauma in your life, you lose someone in your family or a friend, these things will start to affect your art and music, and these two songs are exactly what I think.
I also think you can be a happy person and still do cloudy music.
Peru:
Fujimori has been hospitalized again for medical tests.
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in a public hospital on Tuesday, where he will be tested for the muscle loss he suffers in the lower limbs, his nurse said.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed by his government (1990-2000), suffers from a number of diseases, including tongue cancer, for which he has been operated four times and doctors are currently under control.
MP Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal doctor, told TV channel Canal N that Fujimori will undergo tests within three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases, where they should find out why he suffers and why he loses strength in the lower limbs.
Aguinaga said that in his view Fujimori could get mercy for humanitarian reasons, but the former president himself does not want mercy because he feels innocent.
He was operated on four times because of tongue cancer, lost 18 kilograms, and to these problems were added other disorders such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cysts, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulatory problems in the legs, the doctor said.
Fujimori has been serving sentences since September 2007 in the National Directorate of Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the deaths of 25 people who were killed by the killing squadron of the army operating illegally in the first years of his government.
Mujica on visit to Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica, accompanied by several ministers and entrepreneurs, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday, aiming to achieve the expansion of trade between the two nations and to touch on the political themes of the region in question.
Mujica will meet on Wednesday with her Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón. This is the most important meeting of an extensive visit of a full meeting with representatives of politics, trade and the Uruguayan community living in Mexico. The program was published by the Uruguayan Prezistan.
The meeting of the two presidents in Guadalajara will serve to exchange information on political issues between the two countries," the Uruguayan presidential office said on its website.
According to local media, Mujica will try to get Calderón to support Uruguay in a dispute with France that occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy placed the South American country on the list of tax havens at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened that countries that would continue to remain in the position of tax havens would be excluded from the international community. This statement provoked the rejection of the opinion by Uruguay and the consultation with the ambassador in this European country.
Mexico has presided over the G20 since November. The G20 is a group made up of the world’s most powerful developing and developed countries. With the said Latin American country, an information exchange agreement has been concluded since January this year to prevent double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has sought to concretize fiscal exchange agreements in order to get out of the “black charter” of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), to which countries have not introduced all the required international standards of tax cooperation.
From a trade point of view, Mexico and Uruguay have signed the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) since 2004, which has strengthened trade between the two countries.
The installer runs in 3D thanks to "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been fighting for more than 25 years to save Princess Peach from the sparrows of Bowser, but has never appeared in 3D: in Super Mario 3D Land, he will fight for the love of a girl with stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes to all stores around the world this month, has been designed from the start to take advantage of all the features offered by the Nintendo 3DS Portable console, which allows you to play 3D games without having to wear glasses.
“Mario is a character who has to say how stereoscopy without glasses should work,” said Omar <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, a press specialist at Nintendo in Spain, during a video game presentation in Madrid.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game created specifically for this carrier" because up to now successful images such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of Time 3D" have been adaptations of existing titles.
A Nintendo spokesman said that in addition to the fact that the video is 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and smooth game.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple", the task of which is to attract less skilled users.
Once you have overcome this level, you can get into the "second round" at the levels of the game that are more demanding this time.
In addition, users can choose real-time between "aggressive D" or any one that only affects the depth of the action. But it will be necessary to play in 3D in order to be able to overcome various challenges and "do not resist optical deceptions".
This new Super Maria in 3D also presupposes the return of the character to the portable console, which has not happened since 2005.
In this video game, Nintendo takes note of those who watch the saga and repeats the successful formula from the previous parts. It lies in the fact that the installer of the hooded man will have to go through dangerous mined platforms to free Princess Peach.
Although the player will find news on the moves, in the surroundings, in disguises and also among the enemies, Luigi will also appear "playing" as well.
Colom approves Portilla's release to the United States
President <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Colom said on Tuesday that he had taken steps on the issue of the extradition of former President Alfonso Portilla, who is supposed to be responsible for the conspiracy in the United States to launder <0x24>70 million.
This is the end of the process for Guatemala to respond to a request from a northern country that demands the extradition of Portilla so that it can be tried.
At a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was in line with the independence of the judiciary and the executive and that he recalled that the criminal court had already ordered the extradition.
He assured that during his mandate he "did not interfere" in court decisions and authorised all extraditions that had been made to him.
In addition to Portilla, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be extradited for murder and serious health injuries and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom's move means a step of execution after all judicial and constitutional bodies have been exhausted to lead the process against the former president who ruled from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be issued after its legal situation in Guatemala is resolved and human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was found innocent in a case of fraud of 120 million at the Ministry of Defence during his presidency. This process preceded the extradition, but the Ministry of Public Affairs appealed and thus returned the case to play.
Trinity Helps 6,000 Young People in Emergency
The organization was created to help children without education not to sit on the edge of society.
The balance sheet of the first 25 years of existence of the Trinity social support organization is very important: 6,000 young people threatened with social exclusion have been helped. The organization has helped them over the past 25 years to overcome difficult situations.
To this end, it is necessary to add to the long hundred jobs that have been acquired for this social group.
Last year’s anniversary also served to present a balance sheet within the framework of a ceremony held in the former production facilities of Fabra i Coats and attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was established in the Trinitat Vella neighborhood in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with low education, without work, dealing with drug addiction or in a situation where they could fall into social exclusion.
Yesterday’s meeting in Sant Andreu was attended by a large number of representatives of organizations and institutions that have cooperated with the association over the past 25 years.
Various political representations, at the time of the election, showed the unified nature of the work that Trinity is doing.
Together with the President of the Generalitat, Artur Mass, and his predecessor, Jordi Pujol, former Socialist Adviser for Education, Ernest Maragall, and former Deputy Mayor and current Eco-Socialist Councillor Ricard Goma took part in the ceremony.
The great Fabra i Coats hall was also attended by the current counsel for Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the general director of social work in La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that today also poses a number of obstacles, but added that the work that the association has brought to this day "is a good foundation".
The President said that Trinity is an example of how to fight against unfavorable circumstances and how to give courage to people in difficult situations.
“The crisis is nothing new for this organization and for the work it is doing,” he said.
There was an evacuation of the house where giant parties were held.
Invaders occupy 11 of 13 apartments in a building in Balmes, 51
12 occupants left the house yesterday at noon without putting up resistance
It all proves that the nightmare experienced by the 51st of Balmes Street neighbors is finally over.
Twelve people left the building, where they were illegally inhabited and where they organised gigantic parties built by neighbors, leaving the building from the court order without the police being forced to intervene.
After the operation, the lock on the door was replaced to prevent the situation from being repeated.
"From this moment on, the entrance will be monitored," the administrator said.
The occupants, who took 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest are inhabited - took away all electrical and partially water equipment, also slowed down the walls and left behind waste of all kinds, especially bottles after alcoholic beverages.
In the first three apartments, huge parties took place, lasting up to two days and aroused the other tenants.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that while the building was occupied, sales fell by 80%.
The owner of the disco highlights that the occupants of the building made her unfair competition because they sold drinks for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3, while at the disco it costs <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment company had to respond to the complaints of neighbors because of the noise. But the problems were not caused by the visitors of the disco, but the residents of the house, and especially those who attended the parties, the frequency and intensity of which the intensity of the distractions.
The owner of the disco explained that the problems were so great that they even agreed with the owner of the building and for nine months she would let go of her rent.
Local police have also confirmed that they have received more complaints from neighbors over the past few weeks about the situation.
Alberto Fernández Díaz, chairman of the city’s People’s Party (PP) in the city hall, last week, called for “the building to be immediately evacuated and thus end up with the problems of civil coexistence that neighbours suffer, and with the destruction of the area.”
The president of the people explained that only one floor was blocked last summer, but in recent months the occupants entered all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments, and in one of them there was even theft.
In this regard, he added, "it is necessary to end impunity and to be consistent when it comes to acts against civil responsibility that occurred in the building".
Yesterday, the city police also cleared the building in Nou Barris.
At 3:30 p.m., police arrived in building 35 on Mont-ral Street after it was called by neighbors who saw four people entering the building.
All four were immediately detained.
Park or mountains?
Architects met on the occasion of writing a procedure that brings with it more than a controversy about fees
The 16-door municipal selection process is reopening the debate on the role of the Collserola Park in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the time of the largest bloom that ever disappeared the Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this self-government printed several pamphlets in support of the Collserola Park.
The flyer defined the mountain as a large metropolitan park in Barcelona.
What’s more, it was supplemented by a numerical comparison with New York’s Central Park.
After the CMB disappeared in 1987, the park returned to the minds of many as the upper limit of Barcelona. The Catalan metropolis is one of the few that are not oriented to the north-south axis, but up (mountain) - down (sea).
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park goes in this direction.
The reference was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with wildlife instead of the Yogi bear.
This was the position until September, when the town hall declared a mega competition consisting of 16 bankruptcies for the same number of entrance gates to Collserola.
Of course, the gate records the park’s thoughts.
Either this or someone's trying to put the gate on the field.
So there is only one question: Collserola, park or mountain?
During the competition, both purely organisational and based on the reflection of the city, this question becomes a central theme for all Barcelona architects.
It’s just as shattered as when two members of this old caste chosen to meet in the elevator hand in hand.
And it was this act that caused one of the rare controversies between the three Barcelona architects and the eminent university professors.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the selection process has its reasons.
According to Roldán, after the question of the Gulf side began, "it is necessary" to discuss the "mountain side", so that Ildefonse Cerd's speech on green apples was not reached to the end.
“We have to assume that Barcelona’s largest park is the beach.
Among other things, its great availability.
Collserola is more complex," said the architect, for whom the name "gateways to Collserola" is a "lexicological trap": we must not imagine them "as entrances to the park, but rather as a definition of zones where it is possible to operate".
Modol, as well as Roldán and Bayona with experiences in the world of urbanism, qualifies the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" that poses "some danger".
The danger arising from the "uncertainty posed by the public space project today" following the experience of the 1980s that had in the area of the Forum its "singing labyrinth".
The first concern is the very definition of the borders where they should be built.
“To define something means to take the next step,” it is basically to move a step further.
"It is necessary to keep in mind the new urban planning and planning tools, because the current ones (with reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)) can cause a real disaster."
If we focus on the question in more detail, Modol thinks that the Collserol slope can be "considered a park", but the Barcelona part is not, for reasons purely topographical.
Modol also recalled that there is already work done by the Patronat de Collserol, which "cannot end in the garbage", although he welcomes the fact that the town hall offers his grievance that he will be involved in the project from the "first moment".
And in addition, it understands that the proximity of the mountain and the city is a kind of leak that allows architects to engage in the debate, but "doesn't believe" that it should be this technical profile that will lead multidisciplinary teams ("it's all about skills".
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gave the name of the game is complex, because in the documentation for the selection procedure lacks a global vision of Collserol: "There have been announced 16 selection procedures that deal with all the axis of the mountain - which would be the sea, and it would be the sea, but it does not exist as a whole."
This means that at least he has applied for all 16 selection procedures.
Otherwise, the project of a single gate may be based on the concept and definition of the architect of the neighboring gate.
In his view, the city council should ensure that the strip located directly above Ronda de Dalt should provide the entire length of the zone with equipment to ensure a smooth transition between the city and the greenery.
Casino Excuses Jonas Larrazabal to Be Released
After 72 days of detention, Cadino Red, the law enforcement officer, granted a pardon to the Mayor of Monterrey's brother in a trial in which he was prosecuted for alleged abuse.
Manuel Jonas Larrazábal has spent 72 days in prison and will now be released after he was granted grace by the Casino Red Legislative Officer before the Second Criminal Court in that district, which was discussing a case of extortion in which Monterrey Mayor's brother was charged.
After the assassination at the Casino Royale, the owner of Casina Red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonas had to ask him to pay an economic quota to allow the city council to operate illegally in the gambling house.
Following a public indictment, the State Prosecutor's Office began prosecution of the Panistian Mayor's brother, who was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days on 2 September.
After four hours spent in front of the Public Prosecutor’s Office, the number 3 for property crimes was transferred to prison 1, located in Barrio Antiguo in the state’s capital.
He remained in this place for the next 49 days after the second arrest warrant was issued and an agent of the Ministry of Public Affairs revoked the possibility of co-operation or organized crime.
On 19 October, he was taken to the Cadereyta Criminal Court for suspicion of extortion of the owners of Casina Red in the amount of one and a half million pesos. However, he remained only a few hours in prison with moderately heavy supervision because he was threatened with death.
Leading representatives allowed him to stay in the city halls in San Nicolás de los Garza during the process.
On October 25, he was presented with an arrest warrant issued by the secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who stated that after almost two months of investigation, enough evidence had been collected to prove Jonas's fault, a mere 1.5 million-dollar tip would be among the tip of the tip of the tip of the tip.
On Monday, the legal representative of Casina Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, turned to Judge José Luis Pecin and asked for mercy for the brother of the mayor of the region, who will soon be able to return to freedom.
During the legal hearing with the representative of the Public Ministry assigned to this court, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gómez whether the damages were repaired and which of the associates decided to grant mercy. But the lawyer made it clear that the name would remain anonymous.
On the basis of the official document 197/2011, Jonas Larrazábal is granted legal grace. In the process that was conducted against him, no complaint will be made. It is also not possible to request compensation for damages or punishment.
After a hearing with the legal officer at about 15:50, the court ordered the immediate release of Larrazábal Bretón.
The secretary of the court, Jorge Yanez, went to a prison in the city of San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonas that he had been granted official grace and his case was postponed to the archives.
He also informed him that the judge had issued an immediate order to release him.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome presented details of the plane crash, in which the secretary of the governor, Francisco Blake, and seven others died.
The communications and transport secretariat (SCT) said the results of the crash investigation, in which government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people died, showed that the helicopter had hit the ground with full force, without the pilot's chance to attempt forced landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, the Secretary for Communications and Transport, said that the pilot had noted that the climate conditions allowed flights to take off.
"Parts that appear indicate that the unit has come into contact with the ground several times, the wing has engaged in branches of trees 25 meters from where the unit lost the corpse."
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 people, therefore it met all the requirements for the transfer of personnel.
In addition, he stated that, on the basis of the investigation carried out in the area of the collision, no components were found on the ground.
"In the search, it was found that parts of the aircraft were not in any other place, so the aircraft crashed on the mainland as a whole.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 people, meeting all the requirements for the transport of passengers.
The terrain shows a slope with a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The secretary made sure that at the moment it is most important to get results as quickly as possible. However, the investigation can take several months or up to one year.
Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said that at the time of the crash, the helicopter of the President’s General Staff was moving at flight speed and the accident occurred on a soft ascent field.
"This information supports the hypothesis that at the time of the accident it was a regular overflight operation," he said.
At the press conference, SCT representative Pérez Jácome named six key investigative points:
Visual flight:
In accordance with the aviation standards, the flight was carried out according to the rules of visual flight, that is, the crew must be seen on the ground during the flight.
Meteorological conditions:
Reports in the AICM indicate adequate conditions at the start, according to which the aircraft is moving towards the border, between the DF and the State of Mexico, the visible layers were clouded at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is likely that because of the cloudy, the crew was looking for a lower area and greater visibility to the Cuernavaca Valley.
The location of the collision.
The collision coordinates and the last record of the helicopter from the radar coincide, it is likely that before the collision there was no loss of control or interference with the flight trajectory.
Dispersion of aircraft residues in restricted territory:
The information we have currently available allows us to assume that the collision occurred on the same trajectory and from the side.
The diagram of the displacement of the aircraft's remains indicates that at the time of the impact on the mainland, the helicopter was full.
There were no fires or explosions.
There was no evidence at the scene of the accident that could indicate that there was an explosion or a fire.
The latest results of the investigation show that there may be several contacts with the mainland.
During the field work, the remains of the aircraft were found at an altitude of up to 9200 feet above sea level, the terrain is narrowed, the height of the slope ranges from seven to 30 degrees.
The photographs show footage in which it was likely to break down along the said route.
The information provides elements that seem to suggest that the helicopter could have come into contact with the land in several places.
After careful search in the vicinity of the accident, in an area that is larger than the area of the excavation, no remains of the helicopter were found, which reinforces the assumption that the collision occurred in a condition when the helicopter was still full.
Mexican Institute of Health Insurance Launches Gene Research That Causes Obesity
The Institute of Health Insurance conducts research to discover the gene responsible for obesity in children and adolescents. The research is carried out with the support of experts from the IPN Institute.
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance (IMSS) has announced that it is conducting research in order to discover the gene causing obesity in children and adolescents. The research called "The genetics of obesity in children and adolescents" will allow for results related to obesity.
Miguel Cruz López, head of the Research Medical Unit in Biochemistry at the 21st Century National Health Center, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was established.
This team is based on the support of specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Investav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
Participation in the research can also be made by the general public, with or without authorization. People can come to the participating IMSS sports centres in Valle de México, where they will perform youth tests every week from 8 p.m.
He stressed that the research began at the Cuauhtémoc Sports Centre (Mexico State) and since October 8, this activity is also carried out at the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Centre (East of Mexico State).
Once data from 500 to 600 children are obtained, the study will continue at the Independencia Sports Center (south of the Federal District) and finally at the Morelos Sports Center (north of the Federal Center).
He explained that the aim of this research is to determine the components and the significance of genetics when it comes to the development of obesity, and to trace risk factors on Mexican children and young people, thereby preventing the development of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the International Day of Diabetes, which is celebrated on November 14, he recalled that the aim is to collect data from 3,000 children and young people between the ages of six and 14, with the consent and under the supervision of parents, for the application of specific questionnaires on the subject.
The questionnaire will also be asked about physical activity and family history of hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors that could cause diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He clarified that every Saturday, anthropometric measurements are performed with all participants (weight, height, belt circumference), blood pressure is measured, glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin are determined, and genes are examined (trying to identify the genes that are attached to them).
Cruz López said that this research reflects health care professionals’ concerns about alarming child weight gain.
'Health surveys conducted between 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years, only boys had an increase in obesity by 77% and girls by 47%. Also, there was a dramatic increase in overweight,' the IMSS expert said.
He said that one of the reasons for looking for indicators is the assumption that the population of the country differs from the other populations with its genetic history.
The average Mexican has 65% Indian-American genetic equipment, 30% European and 5% African. This fact is reflected in the genes responsible for the onset of diabetes and obesity.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity is commonly explained as the inability to burn excess energy that we consume (calories) and which is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit of participants is that they are given an overall assessment of the condition of children, thereby determining whether they have any known overweight or obesity.
He said that even the presence of dark-colored wrinkles (acantosis) on the neck and forearm indicates the likelihood that the individual will suffer from metabolic problems and pre-diabetic conditions.
The information is still confidential, doctors pass it on in writing to parents and explain to them all the measurements and lifestyle changes they need to make to prevent their children from getting sick.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause obesity, obesity, and other chronic diseases: a sedentary lifestyle meaning a lack of daily physical activity, a full-day sitting in front of TV, and the use of means of transportation instead of walking on short distances.
Obesity is also caused by a high calorie intake, that is, a higher intake of sweetened beverages, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and the genetic burden that is the subject of this research.
There will be no demands in Asphalt from UNAM
Rafael Herrera, a scientist at the Faculty of Chemistry of UNAM, creates modified asphalt with polymers and thus creates a mixture with better functionality, regardless of climatic conditions and temperatures
If properly cared for the drought, it would not be necessary to repair almost 200,000 droughts after each rainy season in the Valle de México metropolitan area, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, a scientist from the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) drought from UNAM, who would at the same time add drought and drought
In his lecture The Technological Cause of Extrusions, which he delivered during the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory under his leadership is developing modified asphalts with polymers, which should result in a mixture of asphalt-like characteristics, but at the same time the mechanization of both.
Herrera Nájera believes that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places with extremely hot climates, for example in some cities in the north of the country, thus improving functionality and reducing the formation of spills.
He explained that the asphalt, the heaviest part of the oil, is the accumulation of molecules of hydrocarbons, molecules with a large molecular weight called asphaltins, and others with a low molecular weight called maltenes.
The viscoelastic nature of the asphalt is that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees it has a high viscosity and at 50 degrees it is almost in solid condition, while at low temperatures the asphalt tends to break, he added.
This means that the resistance of asphalt in the streets is not uniform, but changes during the day according to weather conditions and temperatures, the chemical engineering expert warned.
A scientist at the Faculty of Chemistry observed that most streets in Ciudad de México are covered with flexible tiles, consisting of six layers of materials, the last three of which are mixed with asphalt.
Among the top layers is the asphalt insert, formed by small stones poured into the asphalt and then pressed.
He stressed that every stone that makes up the insert is poured with asphalt.
When passing cars or creating pressure, it is possible that the forces in the tile are well distributed.
If it were a modified asphalt, it would break down even better, a chemical engineer believes.
He added that the last layer, called a coat, is placed on the asphalt insert, formed by fine stone, i.e. sand also poured into the asphalt.
Since this layer will come into contact with the wheel of the vehicle, it must have greater mechanical strength than the asphalt insert and must ensure the friction of the road.
Since as part of the stretching will be exposed to a large load, the coat must be sufficiently thick and pay attention to the material from which it is made.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature changes, are also a very important factor that should be remembered. Especially water has a big influence on the functionality of the asphalt insert.
Once the terrain is wet, the water spreads inside and is difficult to get out, it causes the softening of all the layers of the tile and thus the formation of molds.
He explained that the coating film is the first to be damaged during the formation of the molds and only then there is damage to the asphalt insert. However, the damage does not occur at one point, but it is a slow process that should stop at the first signs with the help of appropriate maintenance programs.
As a member of the National System of Scientists, he also explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor in the formation of extrusions, and therefore the thickness of each layer of tile must correspond to the load of vehicles and must ensure that this load cannot be exceeded.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that in terms of asphalt, we still have a lot of work to do and research is at the beginning. For example, asphalt emulsions that are already available on the market in other countries and make it easy to fix applications without having to use high tea.
What was missing from the candidate from Valle to become the new Miss Columbia?
Analysis of the factors that contributed to Melina Ramírez Serna’s failure to win the Miss Colombia crown.
Valle wins the 14th title in the first multiples.
Valle del Cauca did not reach the crown of Miss Colombia again.
Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied that she was on the stage of the winners, won a silver crown and a sherpa, on the basis of which she became Colombia’s new first multiples.

That's a question many people ask themselves. What's missing?
The result is the defeat of a great favorite, who in all previous rounds showed that she has to become the new Miss Colombia, and not free of charge to become the Queen of Police and the most beautiful faces of Joile de Volgue. These titles were achieved, for example, by Taliana tias Vargas, and Natalia Natalialum.
One of the key factors that decided that the jury decided to name it only First multiples is the fact that she did not convince her answer to the question: "Which book did you like the most and why?", which was posted by Martín Murillo Gómez from the literary reed.
In response to the candidate's question:
"I read a lot. I really believe in the role of literature, I think it's one of the forms of culture. The book that influenced me most in childhood was "The Little Prince", a very deep book.
Currently I am reading "Crime and Punishment". It is a book that is part of the world literature that we should all know. And today I have a book from Irene Nemirovski, the Russian author. It is a wonderful book called ladore ar deel.
However, she did not like this answer because of the term "culturalization" and, secondly, because the candidate did not explain what the individual books mentioned were noting to her.
After the ceremony, Melina declared that she was calm and delighted with the result: “The world is wise, what is to happen will happen.
And you people, read if you can. The Little Prince is a wonderful book."
Another hypothesis is that Valle destroyed the favorite positions.
The Bogota journalist indicated that the fact that the candidate was from the beginning the most popular, the most celebrated and the one who took all the previous awards (Oster's Gastronomical Challenge, the title of the public for the best artistic dress and Queen Mother), provoked the envy of other artists, the scoundrels, the scoundrels.
This was evident at the first presentation of swimming on Hilton Beach and during two tours before the final coronation.
Even though she shined on both of them, it was known that she lacked the strength and ignition presented by representatives from Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, a reporter for "As Home" on Canal RCN, believes that the fact that Melinda won the title of the first multiples confirms the fact that the candidate who won the most titles during the competition does not eventually leave with the queen's crown."
In addition, Valle has had a rather uncontrollable attitude towards the media in recent days and it has not been worth it.
Another hypothesis is that Valle was unable to convince the jury of his interest in social work, which is the basis of the National Beauty Competition.
Just on the outskirts, two days before the election, international jury member Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who would be aware of the social needs of her country.
"In the Miss Colombia Beauty Competition itself is not enough, it is necessary to see something more than just physical beauty. It is necessary to focus on social feeling. It is important that the candidates before entering the competition, were involved in such projects."
It is also speculated that the candidate Valle lost points due to the shortcomings of her background and fibrosis, which was visible on the ass. But this is completely contrary to the jury's verdict, which chose her Miss "natural beauty" for the most healthy activity.
Jorge Hernán Orozco, who is preparing the queen, admits that Melina didn’t have the best body, that there were better girls here, “but the problems with fibrosis on the ass, which in my opinion was not too noticeable, took her points until the last day.”
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine believes that Valle’s mother made a mistake when she underwent several surgical procedures.
“Surgical interventions are okay, but they didn’t succeed in Valle.
The body has never been her strength, and here she chose her tax.”
Because of this award, which was awarded for the first time by the National Assembly of Beauty, after a tour of the swimsuits, there was a cruel prediction that was fulfilled. It was claimed that this was the satisfaction that Raymundo Melinda gave so that he did not eventually have to give her a penny.
Whether this is true or not, it is certain that Melina started her year of reign today, not as a queen, but as a princess, from a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia at various international competitions, where she will be nominated for the National Competition itself.
However, it will be engraved in history as one of the queens who, despite the staggering success in Cartagena, failed to reach the highest crown.
This was the work of a Cali resident who identified the body of Alfonso Cana.
A Cali fingerprint expert entered history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cana".
The work of these officials is key.
On 4 November last year, a fingerprinting expert from the CTI in Cali entered history as a man who confirmed the identity of Farc's top leader: "Alfonse Cana", by comparing fingerprints.
Of the seven fingerprint experts working at the CTI department, this week was a series of Elias González, a man from Puerta Tejada, who has been working in the field of forensic research for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in a town hall in Chocó, where he often had to go through the forest for more than five days to get to the place where the dead were needed to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to the capital, Valle, and after completing the relevant courses, he began to specialize in fingerprints. This science deals with the study of skin friction, i.e. hands and feet.
In the week that the operation was performed against Alfonso Cano, Elias was told to take his clothes with him for at least three days.
Something big was expected to happen.
On Friday night, he traveled to Cauca in a helicopter from Palmyra.
He knew that he would have to identify two dead bodies and that he suspected that one of them was the man who led the world's oldest guerrilla, so he was asked to take a fingerprint card from Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigating team at the place where the body was located, he did not recognize it because of his physical appearance. He looked completely different than in the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed like a villager in the area, without glasses, much thinner.
But the prints don't lie.
Together with the galton lobe, ink, and transplanter and light, Eliasar started comparing the dactyl records of the dead with the records of the card.
Her eyes were not disappointed: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, a man from Puerto Tejada was commissioned to confirm to the defense minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón, whether he was really the supreme commander of the Farc.
Searching for tracks
For the dactyloscopy of Sijín de Cali, the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos gave to Elias González at the press conference of the operational service against "Can" is very significant.
A lot of people don't know our job.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, without the possibility of a mistake, which can play a key role in deciding crimes.
In addition to identifying the dead, these people assist in investigating crimes such as theft or murder and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When caught, many criminals present fake documents or have no papers at all.
We'll take their fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The investigator said that in case of injury, he had to remove a piece of the wall of the house in the house, because at this place the thief stood up to pull out a safe full of jewelry and money.
“The walls are difficult because they are not designed to take prints, but in this case we could get a full-hand print and identify the offender who was involved in several thefts,” he said.
Fingerprints can also confirm or disprove suspicions in case of murder.
Recently, they found a dead man with bottles of alcohol around them.
Based on the investigation, it was found that one of the family members might be responsible for the murder and the fingerprint on the bottle actually confirmed it.
Although it cannot be 100% confirmed that he was a real killer, it is obvious that he appeared on the crime scene.
A fingerprinting expert from CTI explained that the prints are "deleted with chemical or physical reagents."
When they appear, a transplanter or tape is used for their collection.
Then the prints are sent to Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Registry.
“The problem is that there are still many Colombians at the moment, whose data is not reported anywhere,” the CTI expert said.
He explained that not everything is as shown on the CSI television program.
Like everything that is flickering, it's not gold, not everything you touch, there's traces left.
However, if it can be used, an appropriate comparison must be made.
"Freedom" protests in New York
Hundreds of protesters clashed at Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to stay.
Most of them were waiting for a clearance order and moved to a nearby park.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement provoked a New York official on Tuesday as they tried to get back to Manhattan Square, where they were taken out in the morning, and then tried to take another New York park.
Hundreds of protesters crammed into Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to get thanks to a court order allowing the "heated" to return to settle on the spot. The second part of the movement responded to the clearance by taking the park to the north of the city, where there were further detentions.
"If the court does not allow us to return to the square, we will sit in another place and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, both through assembly and peaceful demonstrations," said one of the spokespersons for the Wall Street movement, Mark Bray.
Bray pointed out that the response of the "exasperated" to the expulsion of the camp, ordered by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg himself, came to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order banning the violent expulsion of the site and allowing protesters to stand here and there.
In addition, the "heating" took another park located at the intersection of central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland tunnel that connects New York and New Jersey, and the land of the fairy in Trinity Church.
They managed to take their place for at least an hour, but then the police came and arrested some of the protesters. Bray did not know the exact number, but said he saw that some journalists had also been put on the wrist.
The organization assures that several hundred people have settled on the site, and a delegation of religious representatives have also come to express their support and to try to negotiate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square, which is a private property, remains closed. A court hearing is expected to take place on Tuesday, during which the legality of the morning evacuation should be analyzed.
Some of the relocated protesters even distributed and distributed copies of the court order and even gave it to members who were guarding the square, causing "some small clashes," Bray said, who condemned the fact that some policemen were demonstrators.
The court order prohibits the authorities from deporting members of the Occupy Wall Street movement or from applying "laws that were published after the raid began, or from prohibiting protesters from accessing the park with shops or other places they used before."
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that due to this court order, the city suspended the reopening of a public space and warned the protesters that local laws do not allow them to return tents and sleeping bags.
The city’s top official personally defended the morning evacuation of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which 200 people were detained and joined because the protesters “broken the law”.
Bloomberg explained that he ordered evacuation of the square because it became "a place where people did not go to protest but to violate laws and in some cases to hurt others" because "some shops received threatening letters" and "neighbors were concerned about the quality of their lives".
"The morning clearing was horrific and shows that Bloomberg is trying to maintain financial interests at the expense of the American working people," a spokesman for the movement, who accused the mayor of "no value for freedom of expression."
Representatives of the Occupa Wall Street movement also said they planned to organise "great events" on Thursday in cooperation with community and trade union organizations to commemorate the two months after the protests, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will present the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show
Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians will appear on the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", a swimmer in "Baywatch", a rabbit in "Playboy", the wife of year-old musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary on a special Christmas show on Canadian television.
CTV announced today that Anderson, along with sentimental singer Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the TV show "It's and Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1 and will embody the Virgin Mary.
CTV today showed footage from a TV show in which Anderson, also known from online home pornographic images, will appear with his ex-husband, the engine "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Leem, as the Virgin Mary holding in the candlesticks of a doll depicting Jesus.
As Josef will appear on stage Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian descent, who recently acted as the moderator on Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, Canadian singer Bublé, who married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, will appear in a special Christmas broadcast on CTV.
Bublé recently called the American woman Kim Kardashian "little" at one of her concerts in New York City.
Japan returns to life after devastating earthquake
GDP increases by 1.5% due to household consumption and ends the period of falls that began in March
Since March last year, Japan’s economy has been paralysed, now recovering from a devastating earthquake that has grown into a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster the country has faced since World War II.
The first estimates by the Tokyo government amounted to <0x24>300,000 million in material losses, a wound that heals well despite the difficult global situation.
After three quarters of decline, the GDP was in such a position between July and September that it was possible to turn the page with definitive validity: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% per year.
In addition, the results of the second quarter - for Japanese tax year beginning in March 2012 - predict the highest growth rate compared to the period from January to March 2010.
The revival can be partly explained by the purchase of machines necessary for the restoration of areas destroyed by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
The companies increased their investments by 1.1%, spending drop by 0.9% compared to the January-March period. This is the first drop after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real awakening of the Japanese economy is based solely on the impulse that forces us to take advantage of the crisis to bring about reinforcements or to rebuild infrastructure, which is to take advantage of the shortage of fully starting from scratch.
Japan has woken up, especially due to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, thanks to increased spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
Your Stigma
The flows were put into the hands of the internal market when the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "rescue values" for investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the worrying US forecasts. It is a privilege, which is at the same time a huge burden to underdevelopment.
With stronger currencies, products abroad are more expensive, which is negative for a country whose economy is determined by the financial health of large technological groups.
For example, Toyota or Sony attributed their weak results in July to September just the yen exchange rate.
While markets continue to occupy EU border countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government is cautious.
"We must pay attention to the risks that persist, such as the destruction of some foreign economies, the impact of flooding in Thailand and the rapid rise in the yen," State Secretary for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa said yesterday.
And the prospects are really not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said that most member countries showed clear signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator, which predicts inflexibility in the world economy, has shown that the economy of the major powers is slowing down.
It fell by four decades to 100.4 points compared to 100.8 in August.
The euro area has even gotten below the 100-level average, reaching the 99.13-point level.
Athens is spreading uncertainty again.
Papadimos says savings measures will be approved, but conservatives will not sign any written commitments
With rapid and risky marginal guarantees and the uncertainty that has once again prevailed, Greece is increasingly plunged into a maze leading to the outbreak of the great debt crisis in Europe.
The assumption that the new transitional Greek government's "consensus" is given by the demands of Brussels rather than by the real conviction of the political forces is beginning to be confirmed.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, admitted yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period he received during his appointment is likely to be short for their application, the president of the Conservative party's 19-day trials of the New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, said in a statement that he did not.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decision of the summit of October 26," Papadimos said yesterday during a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the government.
The package of 24 programmes to support employment, reform of the Code of Discipline of Officials and new measures against tax evasion will be among the first initiatives.
However, Samaras’s message does not clarify any doubts about his stance: “We have committed ourselves to helping the transitional government, but we have committed ourselves to nothing else.”
The president of the Conservatives went a little far in his address to the EU and the IMF. These organizations are supposed to unblock the <0x24>8 billion that Athens urgently needs. At the same time, he has declared that he will not support and will not sign any commitment to delivering the savings.
The European Commission, already distinguished by the impact of Papandreou’s referendum plays, yesterday stressed that its demands are insurmountable: it will not unlock any aid unless the new government and the main parties sign the “written commitment and no written commitment.”
Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj explained that the inspectors from the Troika will return "very soon" to Athens and will talk with the new government about "what needs to pay the sixth part" 8 billion.
The Greek parachute has a long way to go.
Queen Sophia: "There are tools for progress and hope"
The Queen raises Spain’s privileged position in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has achieved a significant global position in terms of microfinance."
Queen Sophia recalled yesterday that the country has become the second donor of the planet in the last two decades in terms of this instrument of cooperation, the essence of which is "that it is an instrument of social progress, justice and hope for a better future."
Yesterday, the Queen launched the 5th World Microloan Summit in Valladolid with the conviction that there is "no doubt" that this kind of operation "is absolutely necessary" to achieve the Millennium Goals, not the Millennium Goals, which the UN has set for the year 2015.
Spain "will continue to work" and expand its network of volunteers "in all corners of the planet and take on this task responsibly," Queen Sophie stressed, hoping that the initiatives and benefits of the summit, which will last up to Thursday, will "provide for the best of the capacity and the best of the ability to build up".
"We've already achieved a lot" and "many challenges are still ahead of us."
The micro-loan summit is to be not only a discussion forum, but also a platform that supports the "basic objectives".
Her Majesty explained that the goal is that by the end of 2015 175 million poor families will have access to these financial services and that 100 million families will get above the poverty line they currently live under.
The concept of a microloan spread to Spain and other countries of the world after "the pioneer of the idea of Muhammad Yunus embarked on this journey," the queen said, adding that it was "an act of justice and necessary recognition".
The father of the instrument described it as an "admirable idealist who embarked on a journey to fight poverty". She met with his work 15 years ago when she emigrated to Bangladesh to get acquainted directly on the spot with his loan policy.
The first world summit in Washington, D.C., and other meetings such as the Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, were followed by the following experiences. "At all these meetings, I was able to see the constant development," explained the queen, who was "supporting this project" with her "shearings" in her horn.
Queen Sophia concluded her speech by calling on the participants to engage in discussions and seek solutions, allowing them to continue the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, declared that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" to be governed by all democratic states.
In this sense, she said, it would be a mistake to associate cooperation with developing countries only with a period of bullying, because this cooperation is a "permanent duty".
Jiménez believes that micro-loans are a "serious and honest policy to eradicate poverty" and now more than ever before, developed-country governments must work in accordance with the criteria of solidarity and not allow solidarity to become precisely the victims of cuts.
For Spain, micro loan is one of the main lines of development cooperation.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, welcomed the success, which celebrates the concept based on giving confidence to people to whom everyone else is closing the doors. Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed his participants in which city.
The CDU proposes to elect a European president on the basis of general voting rights
Without serious problems for the chancellor and chairman of the Christian Democratic Party Angela Merkel, the first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) took place on Monday, November 14, in Leipzig.
The question of Europe's future was not originally on the programme, but it only happened in the autumn, in particular to satisfy the members of the party, who consider the government's policy today against Greece and perhaps tomorrow against the Italians as lazy.
The proposal for the President of the European Commission submitted by the Executive Board has been adopted almost unanimously.
Only nine of the 1001 delegates were against and 10 delegates abstained.
The several-minute eggs stand at the end of Angela Merkel’s speech and a few hours later Wolfgang Schäuble, the very pro-European finance minister, left no room for doubt.
The chancellor's main idea and proposal can be summarized in a slogan: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
According to the Chancellor of Europe, “the time for change has come.”
This could be expressed by changes in the Treaty of Lisbon allowing the European Union to strengthen its control over the budgetary policies of the euro area Member States, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of general electoral right "to give Europe a chance".
This is in any case one of the ideas of the proposal adopted by the Congress, whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is certainly unlikely that all twenty-seven countries will agree quickly on this revolutionary step: the United Kingdom is against it, and the CDU leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy will take the same stance.
But the direction is drawn.
Similarly, the delegates rejected a large majority of the proposal to assess the weight of each country on the Board of Directors of the European Central Bank, depending on the weight of its economy, which would obviously lead to a stronger weight for Germany.
Concerned about calming the climate inside her party, the Chancellor made several references to Conrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But she did not try to get Congress talks about "small" European states or states that are in trouble, willing to criticize arrogant N.
Although the proposal on Europe deals with one paragraph on the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not quote France.
Just indirectly.
When she recalled that just two hundred years ago there was a bloody battle in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is fraud in the event of an incapacity to work?
After the support, the UMP party and the government launch an offensive against incapacity for work.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, December 15, to visit the Social Support Office, where he will make a speech on the issue of combating social fraud and redistribution of solidarity.
Accompanied by this offensive, which is based on the willingness to make savings in the context of increased rigor, but is no less clear from the perspective of the right-wing presidential campaign, the right-wing majority wants to focus on incapacity to work.
First of all, because of budget savings, the government intends to impose a fourth day of incapacity on private sector employees before they start taking aid in the disease.
Clearly, without the consent of the company, the sick employee would lose four days of his salary, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that risks causing a lot of bad blood, but which according to the newspaper Les Echos could bring in <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>280 million.
And also measures that would be accompanied by other measures of symbolic scope: giving state employees one day of unharmed incapacity (to date they have no incapacity compared to three days in the private sector).
While these issues are the subject of discussion, the right-wing majority will also trigger the fraud theme, this time focused on crimes related to work incapacities.
"Controls will be much broader and more importantly: if you land, you will return," Xavier Bertrand said in an interview with RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effects of notification appear somewhat disproportionate in view of the truth about irregularities in incapacity for work.
In fact, these have been the subject of constant monitoring since 2002 and of political effort that has yielded its fruits.
The French are not sicker than elsewhere in Europe.
Let’s start with a few official numbers.
According to the Caisse nationale d'assurance maladie (CNAM), more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>237 million of daily allowances were paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Health Research and Documentation, in 2008, 5% of expenditure on health was made up of daily allowances of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.3 billion.
Of this amount, 46% were for maternity allowances and occupational accidents and 54% were for disability, i.e. <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6.2 billion.
That is only 2.5% of the cost of health care.
According to a study by Alma Consulting, the French had an average of 14.5 days of disability in 2010 compared to 17.8 days in 2009.
The average that hides certain deviations: another survey published in 2007 on Monster.com’s job opportunities sites showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed answered that they did not choose a day job.
Another study, this time carried out by health insurance institutions, specifies that in 2010 37.8% of disabilities were shorter than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to three months and 11% lasted longer.
When comparing them to their European neighbours, French employees are no more prone to incapacity to work than elsewhere.
One long study conducted in 2010 by two researchers of the CNRS (National Research Centre) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the overall absence (for health reasons or not) in France ranged between 10% and 11.8% versus 20% and 28% in the UK, 18% in Denmark and 15% in the UK.
Cheating in disabilities is only a very small part of working in black.
When it comes to scams, these are only a small scale.
The strengthening of the legislation since 2002 has resulted in systematic checks on disability for more than 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM found that in 1.5 million checks, 13.8% of the 285,000 were carried out due to short-term incapacity "unauthorised or too long", i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically checked incapacity for more than 45 days, 11% of cases were "unadjusted or unauthorised" for 1.2 million checks, i.e. 132,000.
A total of 169,000 "unauthorized" cases for several million workers who were incapacitated.
A number that represents much less than a number expressing work in black.
According to UMP Dominique Tiana, the author of the June report on this issue, this figure would represent 9 to 15 billion euros lacking in tax collection per year, i.e. more than the total amount of daily allowances and thus infinitely more than the fraud associated with the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to implement a new rescue plan
Greece will need a new rescuing program to restore its economy.
On Monday, December 14, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos said that the 100 days of unity given to his government will not be enough to fulfill this task.
"In order to rebuild our economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new bailout budget," the head of government said in his first public speech on Wednesday at the start of a parliamentary vote debate.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on October 27 will be "the main task" of the new government, as the participation of our country in the eurozone is in the game, he added.
As a result, Papademos predicted that the country's public deficit would be "around 9%" of gross domestic product from now until the end of the year after it was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The law rejects new austerity measures
Right leader Antonis Samaras on Monday expressed his support for a measure already approved to try to escape the debt crisis, but warned that his party is not committing to any additional austerity measures.
"We will not take any new measures by hand," Samaras stressed at a meeting with MPs for his New Democracy.
We have agreed on the targets of deficit and debt reduction and the fight against waste, but we are against any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
Mr Ollim Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic Affairs and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8 billion loan without a written guarantee from all sides to support the proposed measures, replied that his word would be enough and that he would not be able to do anything.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide need to be legalized, says expert committee
According to the Royal Canadian Society, Canadians have been denied death.
In the case of palliative care, the Commission urges governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care even in cancer cases.
Canadian society is living with the idea of denying death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually accept the opportunity to talk to a doctor about the conditions in which they want to die, and make decisions in this regard.
This is one of the conclusions of an extensive report by the Royal Canadian Society, which included six experts working in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This committee recommends that the government amend criminal law to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia if this option appears necessary for a patient deemed competent to make such a decision.
At the beginning, experts cited a recent survey by the independent agency Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries on the planet.
Although Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that "the cure of death in Canada has given rise to a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death."
Medicalization yes or no, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, experts with the mandate of the Royal Canadian Society inform us.
And despite the desire to die at home, which most Canadians have, 68.6% of them die in the hospital.
This average applies to the whole of Canada, while in the province of Quebec this number is the highest with 86% of the deaths in the hospital.
With regard to the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said that it does not want to change anything about criminal law relating to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
According to experts who have also checked all countries where these approaches are legalized or not considered a criminal case, there is no evidence that this decriminalization causes some abuse in the application, i.e. in the practice of euthanasia or non-helpful or non-helpful suicide.
On the contrary, Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, confirmed yesterday at a teleconference more than many cases of these oversights in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
“Euthanasia is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.”
“Assisted suicide is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal,” explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians are prone to euthanasia
According to a 2010 survey by the Angus Reid Forum, 85% of Canadians have already spoken in favor of euthanasia because they believe it will allow end-of-life people to ease their suffering.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not mean sending a message that the lives of elderly or disabled people are less expensive.
As for people who practice assisted suicide, 41% of respondents feel they should not be prosecuted.
When it comes to maintaining or discontinuing patient care, the situation is less clear, the authors of the report say.
They also propose in the list of their recommendations that it be stated in criminal law that withdrawal from treatment for which there is a legally confirmed refusal is not criminal.
The Commission of Experts also requires that professional doctors be trained to respect the obligation to refuse treatment at the end of their lives without fear of prosecution.
In the case of palliative care, the Commission urges governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care even in cancer cases.
Finally, with regard to palliative or final silence already widely used in Canadian health facilities, the Commission calls for it to be considered at a time when it no longer serves to reduce physical pain, as a matter of euthanasia and to be subject to the same procedures.
Reservations by other experts
Some medical law experts have already expressed their reservations about the conclusions of the Royal Canadian Society’s expert report.
Mr. Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in medical law, has qualified the position of experts-signatory of the report as "extreme" among other things because it does not limit euthanasia practice to the sick in the final stage.
“This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and who is over the age of 18 could ask to help him commit suicide,” said Pierre Deschamps, who studied the summaries yesterday.
Mr. Deschamps also stresses that it appears that the authors of the reports built the autonomy of the person above all other values that form the social predecessor of society.
Because "in society, he says, there are warning signs and limitations."
Medical law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong objections to the conclusions of the report, which she described as a "manifest for euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Canadian Society, in particular doubts the data of the report on the absence of doubt in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, i.e. in the Netherlands and in the U.S. state of Oregon.
Jordan King Calls President Assad to Resign
Damascus talks about a "conspiracy"
Syria is increasingly isolated from Syria.
Bashar al-Assad’s supporters were in a demonstration yesterday in front of the Foreign Ministry.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure on Syria was intensified by President Bashar al-Assad, who with Russia’s support is resisting them and talking about a “conspiracy” against his country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria’s membership in the League of Arab States, the European Union has stepped up its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and neighboring Syria’s Jordan have taken an opinion in favour of President Assad’s resignation.
Jordan’s King Abdallah II was the first ruler of the Arab state yesterday to call on President Bashar al-Assad to kill some 40 civilians and members of the regime’s military.
"If Bashar had the interests of his country at heart, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the conditions necessary for a new phase of Syria's political life," Jordan's neighbor, King Jordan, said in an interview with the BBC.
The head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, regretted that the Turkish mediation effort undertaken by the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had not been crowned with success.
"Those who do not live in peace with their people in the Middle East and cannot satisfy them, will leave," he said with a rhetoric on neighboring Syria, to which Turkey is applying an increasingly tough line.
The United States welcomed the “strengthening consensus against Assad and dishonest actions by the Syrian regime” following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States, countries like Turkey are applying an increasingly harsh tone" against the repression in Syria, said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, 16 civilians and 19 pro-government forces were killed in the southern Syrian city of Deraa during this period.
According to the NGO, two other civilians were killed "in shootings and concentrated shootings from heavy guns in the city of Jobar" in the Homs area.
However, during a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem said the country had “taken a step out of the crisis.”
He also reacted vividly to the decision of the League of Arab States to suspend Damascus membership, which he said was a "dangerous step".
"Syria is not inclined," he said, adding that "conspiracy against Syria will fail."
Following its decision to suspend Syria's membership, the League of Arab States is currently considering a "civil protection mechanism" and plans to send 500 human rights defenders, journalists and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé is also in favour of the idea of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which he says is "paranoid".
A new special meeting of the League is to be convened tomorrow in Rabat to take an opinion on the plan for resolving the crisis, which was decided on 2 December and which specifically envisaged the withdrawal of troops from the cities seized by the displaced and liberated manifestos.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said yesterday that the Arab League's decision was "wrong" while China called on Syria to adopt a plan to resolve the crisis, but it did not support any possible sanctions against Damascus.
ITALIAN
Monti demands time and sacrifices for Italians
The next Italian government chief, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for some time to form his team and start implementing a program that will contain "victims" in order to regain the credibility lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner discussed with political parties yesterday before meeting today with representatives of trade unionists and employers.
It should consist of a relatively thin cabinet composed of technocrats who are not members of parliamentary parties.
"Monti talked about an important programme with many victims," Francesco Nucara, a member of a number of parliamentary groups involved in the talks, said after meeting with the appointed prime minister.
House Speaker Gianfranco Fini expects Mario Monti to ask parliament to express confidence by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultation will end with Mario Monti’s presentation of a small team of twelve ministers to President Giorgio Napolitano.
Mario Monti commented yesterday about the nervousness in the financial markets and asked for time.
"Democracy has precise terms" when it comes to the preparation of the government and its programme, he stressed, adding that he is "certain that markets will be patient and understandable".
His appointment as president was initially welcomed by the markets, but the concern reappeared after the unexpected September downturn of industrial production in the euro area.
The nominated prime minister should set up a team of technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to include "politics" in it.
He said he was convinced that the new government would last until 2013, i.e. until the date of the next election.
Speaker Gianfranco Fini said the new government will receive the confidence of parliament by Friday.
After taking office, Mario Monti promised that he would act with extraordinary urgency and with a view to making Italy "re-becoming a strong article" of Europe.
European Commissioner Olli Rehn said: "With the new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy will not change."
The European Union is convinced that, despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, Rome will not achieve its budgetary target in 2013, and demands new tough measures.
Confindustria’s chief executive Emma Marcegagli, who will meet Monti on Tuesday, focused on the need to revive the economy “because a country that does not show growth can’t comply with deficit parameters”.
Mario Monti, former European Commissioner (1994-2004), recognized for his expertise and independence, is a "professor" who, according to the authors of the initiators, symbolizes "a challenge to seriousness" and "another Italy", represents an "epochal change" for Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism".
The time of his team's life will be unknown.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy must deposit <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 billion in government bonds by April 2012.
Soviet Scientist Helped Iran's Nuclear Program
Soviet scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator used for nuclear weapons, a U.S. non-governmental organization specializing in atomic risks said on Tuesday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents unique to the United Nations agency.
Last week, the IAEA expressed its "serious concern" about the "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to the ISIS Institute, widely extracted from the documents of the MAAE, V. Danilenko (born 1934) should have worked for three decades since the 1960s at the Soviet military research center in Chelyabinsk (Ural), where he should have been engaged in the production of synthetic diamonds by an explosion method.
In 1989 or 1991 he had to leave the center to set up a company producing "nano-diamonds" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company were to lead him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Prior to his return to Russia, he had to cooperate from 1996 to 2002 on the Iranian programme.
In its latest report, the IAEA recalls "clear data that the development of the detonation system carried out by Iran" was based on "the work of a foreign specialist who not only knew this method well, but who - as one Member State informed the Agency after informing the agency - worked on the program during a substantial part of his career".
Anti-Muslim Crimes and Crimes Up 50%
According to FBI statistics released on Monday, the number of crimes and crimes directed against Muslims increased by nearly 50% from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time other racial and religious violence fell slightly or slightly.
According to these figures, the total number of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. a 49% increase compared to the 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes against Jews, and a 14% increase in crimes against Jews, and an overall increase in crimes against Christians.
The total number of "hateful crimes" rose very easily to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After the loss in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes rise again," Human Rights First, a human rights organization, said in a statement, "the rise in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant."
"Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crime, must be considered a serious violation of human rights," said Paul Legendre, a senior executive of the organization.
“The U.S. government can and must do more to deal with these crimes,” he adds, estimating that this could be achieved by improving police reports of “hateful criminal acts.”
"Hateful criminal act" in U.S. federal law is the legacy of the civil rights struggle.
This legal order was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish the violence associated with race, skin color, religion, origin, and now even sexual orientation.
Twitter is changing and more like Facebook
Twitter’s microblogging site on Monday introduced design changes to allow its users to watch the activity of followers, somewhat resembling its Facebook services.
The new "activity" and "name" offers allow you to better and directly know the activity of other people who follow you or people whose responses ("tweets") you follow.
This lets you know if they allow you to track your posts, if they sign in to new accounts, if they have favorite posts, etc.
This new face of Twitter was tested "in August on a small percentage of users" before it was extended to the entire network on Monday, AFP spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told Twitter.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive functioning, with terms somewhat incomprehensible (RT for repeated dissemination of someone else's post, followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre user) making Facebook le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi un grand public plus public plus avec un objectif comparable et un maniement plus un objectif comparable des utilisateurs).
On the network, users immediately assess the importance of this innovation in their "tweets" differently.
“It’s unnecessary, it takes up a lot of space and it looks too much like Facebook,” <0x40>jemb123 wrote.
"The Activity feature will help me better track some elements of my Twitter," <0x40>dannykronstrom said.
Austrian
the inclusion of the Golden Rule on the Balanced Budget in the Constitution
The government of a large coalition of social democrats and Christian democrats, which is in power in Austria, decided on Tuesday to include a "golden rule" of fiscal policy in the constitution with a view to reducing the public deficit and thus avoiding a possible reduction in the rate of AA.
It was Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann himself who announced this decision at the conclusion of the Council of Ministers in a situation where Austrian public debt is 74.6% higher than the criteria set by the Maastricht Agreement, but much less than a country.
“If Austria’s solvency had been reduced by only one degree from AAA to AA<0x2B>, we would have to pay <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion more on interest each year,” said Christian Democrat Michael Spindelegger, the chancellor and foreign minister.
Austria thus follows the request of the Eurozone summit held in Brussels on 26 October 2011, where the Heads of State and Government have called for a reduction in the public deficit and a balance of public accounts to be recorded in the balance sheet by the end of 2012.
The instrument adopted by the Austrian government is approaching the "German model", Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the public structural deficit will have to decrease by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and from 2017 onwards, the federal government's structural deficit will not be able to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the federal government will have to divide, as well as
The objective is to achieve public debt by 2020/21 under the 60% criterion laid down by the Maastricht Treaty.
Strong only
Noda threatens new intervention in foreign exchange markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese institutions would have to intervene again in foreign exchange markets if they were to continue strengthening.
"We'll end up like we did last time if we find too much instability" at the exchange rate of the yen, Y. Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, he again climbed to the historical values that the Japanese authorities forced to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo sold yen for dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which only recently surpassed the record against the dollar in force since 1945.
But only since then has there has been a regular rise in the support of purchases by investors who consider it a "safe port" in times of uncertain global economic slowdown and the European crisis caused by debt.
The dollar again fell below 77 yen on Tuesday, and the euro fell below the symbolic 105 yen mark to close to the levels triggered by the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis in 2008-2009, the dollar was worth about 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
This rise in Japanese currency is detrimental to island exports, as it lowers the price of products Made in Japan and lowers the value of Japanese companies’ foreign earnings when they convert them into domestic currencies.
"Japan is recovering" from the damage caused by the March earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region in the northeast of the country, Y. Noda stressed, fearing that this irritation will not kill the yen in the eggs of fragile revival.
The world’s third-largest economic power resumed growth in the third quarter (1.5% compared to the previous quarter) for the first time in a year thanks to a survey of the growth in exports and consumption of households burdened by disaster.
But the prime minister believed that the high value of the yen did not reflect "the national economy of Japan".
Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Central Bank of Japan (BoJ), which launched a two-day meeting of its political and monetary council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the institution’s vice-governor Hirohide Yamaguchi warned that BoJ had already taken “adequate measures” indicating that no additional monetary weakening could be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the Securities Issuers Institute increased its purchases of State Treasury Notes by 5,000 billion yen (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>47 billion) and increased to 55,000 billion yen (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>519 billion) the ceiling of the amount devoted to purchases of various securities with a view to liquidity.
Eurozone:
Prices go up, stock exchanges fail
The risk of a debt crisis continues to undermine European indicators.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth rates in France and Germany, the rates of weakened countries continue to grow.
European exchanges, still concerned about the stability of the euro area, are falling to negative expectations on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, the CAC 40 index loses 1.4% to 3,064 points at 10:00.
The Dax Index loses 0.4% in Frankfurt and 0.1% in London.
“With the new tensions surrounding loans from eurozone countries in trouble, stock markets around the world continue to spend only a fraction of their recent profits.”
“Nervous investors are just too aware of the risk of infection,” explains Terry Pratt, a broker at IG Markets, quoted Reuters as saying.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed with a 0.7% drop, which suffered from concerns from market participants about Europe’s ability to cope with the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has eyes on Europe and the exchange will only continue in a narrow corridor of variations until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilized," said Mitsushige Akino, a fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resumption of uncertainty about the future of the euro area is damaging the currency itself, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro is at its lowest level since a month and a half ago.
At 10 o’clock, the European currency is worth <0x24>1.3570 at a withdrawal of 0.4%.
According to brokers, the currencies fell after CDU Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU party adopted a proposal at its congress on Monday suggesting the possibility of leaving the eurozone for countries in trouble without having to leave the European Union.
Italian and Spanish tariffs far beyond the 6% border
Interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
This morning, the return on Italian ten-year bonds is 6.85% and the return on Spanish ten-year bonds is 6.2%.
These tensions affecting interest rates in southern European countries, but also in France, continue to exacerbate market participants’ concerns.
The future Italian government chief Mario Monti has demanded time in the markets to correct the situation in Italy threatened by poisoning caused by the increase in its debt.
Greece’s new Prime Minister Lucas Papademos has confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on October 27 will be “the main task” of his government.
Spain is once again in the deliberate direct direction of the markets when elections to the House of Representatives are held in the country on Sunday.
The difference in rates ("spread") between Germany and Spain's ten-year bonds reached a new historic high.
Expecting figures indicating the growth of the euro area
Statistics say that France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, mainly due to household consumption, i.e. slightly better than expected growth of 0.3%.
However, the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) revised the figures down in the second quarter to a 0.1% decline in GDP instead of stagnation.
This is the fourth quarter of the year that most concerns the economy.
During the same period, Germany recorded an increase of 0.5%.
The first estimates for the whole euro area are expected at 11 p.m., while the European Commission has just pointed out the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must prevail over dogma.
If there is a topic that cannot be grasped on the basis of short-term balances or under emotions, then it is energy policy.
The availability and price of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and competitiveness of businesses.
It is natural that the meeting in the elections will be an opportunity to think about such deposits and the place that takes energy from the core.
The debate will only succeed if all the economic, social and environmental impacts of the proposed options are examined.
The French must base their stance on objective facts and rational data.
So far, there are 7 billion human beings on the planet, but demographic developments will double the demand for electricity by 2050 if we don’t want a significant part of the world’s population to get rid of important parts of life.
At the same time, it will be necessary to face the lack of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity, and not to forget the necessary need to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in order to combat climate change, which is a matter of urgency.
The Fukushima accident does not affect any of these parameters.
And that is why Germany is left alone in its decision to refuse nuclear energy.
However, this is not the case for Belgium, which subordinates its decision to find some other source capable of replacing itself, nor for Switzerland, which considers it appropriate to build only the next generation of power plants.
On the contrary, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to cite at least some countries, continue with determination in their projects.
After Fukushima, the United States decided to expand its park by one unit by rebuilding a power plant that had been disrupted after the Three Mile Island plant crash.
If a German model based on renewable energies is ever presented as an example, reality contradicts that.
The election of Berlin will be reflected in the rise in electricity prices, the increased energy dependence on gas imported specifically from Russia, the sharp increase in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of natural gas and coal power plants.
All these unpleasant effects will be felt within a few months.
The case of Denmark deserves to be thought of.
The European champion in wind turbines, of which 30% of its electricity is deprived, is also one of the largest consumers of coal and gas due to wind irregularities, resulting in CO2 emissions and the price of Danish electricity is 65% higher, respectively, than 50% of European electricity.
On the contrary, due to the immutability of our energy policy, our neighbors will pay 40% more for electricity than the French households pay.
While in a globalised economy, energy costs are a key factor in competitiveness and guaranteeing the maintenance of industry on the national territory, French companies enjoy the benefits of the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would result in a sharp increase in electricity prices, which would make the illusory beautiful declaration of the re-industrialization of our country and the defence of the purchasing power.
The price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay, just as they are not essentially opposed to this energy, as public opinion polls show.
Let us remind you that our country’s energy policy has enabled the construction of an industry with 125,000 direct jobs and with 410,000 continuing jobs.
The highly exporting sector is attracting a large number of small and medium-sized specialized jobs-creating enterprises to international markets, which cannot be transferred abroad.
If France decided to leave the nuclear power plant, it would sacrifice a small number of these small and medium-sized enterprises and lose <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 billion a year to export nuclear facilities and services.
Which plant owner would order a nuclear reactor designed to work for 60 years, while the fall of its producer would be planned?
In solving the energy equation, it is necessary to admit that there is no magical source for energy production, and there is no devil.
The development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable-energy facilities by the French industrial group AREVA demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is absolutely necessary to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have a State Agency for Nuclear Security, which carries out an uncompromising and transparent oversight of existing nuclear power plants as well as the construction of a new power plant in Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, have a sense of safety in the blood.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three major accidents.
The only one in Three Mile Island happened under normal operating conditions and remained without human sacrifice and environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, drama caused the concepts of the reactor and unforgivable human errors.
In the case of Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude, which caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will take lessons from this accident just as it did in the previous two.
The result of this step and cooperation between the French and German nuclear safety authorities, operators and engineers is that the EPR-type reactor is a concept capable of resisting such phenomena.
While all those interested in building a nuclear power plant consider it, halting its construction in Flamanville would be an excellent gift offered to AREVA and EDF competitors and paving the way for a leading position in the nuclear power plant.
It is necessary and legitimate to look for the best energy solution for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and machinations control the debate so decisive for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
Nicolas Sarkozy's immigration policy has been criticized from various angles - the police, courts and administrations subject to a number policy, the compatibility of this policy with the "land of human rights" status that France boasts.
Recently, it was an administrative harassment targeted by foreign students, which became a topical issue when the Minister of the Interior (see the May 23 Libération) declared that France "does not need foreign talents, walls and waitresses."
But so far, it has rarely been discussed from an economic point of view.
It must be said that there is a fairly wide agreement between the left and the right in this area.
To the right, in 1976, Jacques Chirac declared that "9,000,000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country with 2 million immigrant workers" and left-wing Michel Rocard, when in 1990 he said that France "can't accept all the misery of the world".
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
In 2005, fear of the invasion of hordes of Polish installers in French territory was shared to the right and to the left.
In both camps, immigrants are perceived as a burden to the economy and French society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that we are proud to give to immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande confines himself to banalities, stating that joint development will enable us to solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden and the problem may apply in elections, but economically it is very expensive.
As the economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in their recently published paper synthesizing the latest knowledge of immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, p.
Restricting immigration protects growth and harms employment.
Concerns about the impacts of migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace French workers, especially those less skilled, and create pressure to lower their wages.
But experience shows that, in fact, immigrants are much more complementary than French workers’ substitutes by doing work in sectors with a shortage of employees.
Few qualified immigrants in sectors that do not attract French employees, and those most qualified in dynamic sectors where education is not enough to offer jobs.
Positive impact on salaries
Just as the surgeon will have trouble working in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, these supplements between French and migrants cause the arrivals of immigrants to have a positive impact on the wages and employment of French employees.
Giovanni Peri thus calculated that a 1% increase in migration movements would result in a long-term increase in real wages between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And at the same time, it does not take into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a high proportion of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems in European countries, on average 1% of the total budget.
The World Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany one immigrant aged 30 will bring a net contribution (income minus expenditure) of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150,000 to the public budgets for the rest of his life.
Nicolas Sarkozy expressed at the beginning of his mandate his desire to achieve the missing percentage of growth "with his teeth elevated".
The teeth used to deter immigrants had the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, it remains to think about European democracy
Democracy is a rare and very fragile commodity.
The European continent should remember this, despite the fact that it was invented in Athens 2,000 years ago, experienced during the twentieth century the tragedies of world wars, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also France in Spain, Salazar in Portugal.
Some people might have believed that in order for democracy to triumph over its enemies, it would be enough to make an election and to make it as straight as possible.
However, it is already known from Napoleon that it was the ease of thinking.
General voting, although a necessary condition for democracy, is not a sufficient condition and can become a “instrument of repression,” as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organization of separation and control of power, education, enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis of Europe we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it has been the same since the beginning of the crisis of politics and democracy.
Admitting the error of the Greek referendum type yes-no will have in this sense the value of a double revelation: the revelation of the need for a great return to political power, but also the revelation of the worrying feeling of its impossibility, of its inadequacy.
This ambivalence must be thought out in order to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of democratic interference have shifted today and that many of the Republican fighters are no longer shooting in the right direction.
There is nothing we can gain if we demand a series of national referendums organised as necessary and disorganized.
Bianko exposed to a European absolutist monarch or a leap with his legs tied to an empty nationalist depth: what a choice for the citizen!
No, we don't want a gilet knife, but a joint, full-fledged, peaceful and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - or we would no longer know where to stop the list - because the crisis is in Europe.
It is, in fact, a whole Europe that is facing a dictatorship of markets and rating agencies, which suffers from its incompetence and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe, which is humiliated on the international stage.
We are disturbed by the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe, which is slowly losing its sovereignty and each of its peoples with it.
It is urgent to restore the management of the European project of democratic sovereignty.
For it is only together that Europeans will be able to reduce the burden of their debt, get rid of the governments of the markets, and by investing to prepare for the future.
The outbreak of the crisis will involve decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, otherwise it would lead us to disaster.
After we have long fought against this proposal by the Socialists and by Jacques Delors, everyone today strongly demands the European economic government.
Goodbye.
But to think about it without a stronger political and democratic integration, and experienced as such citizens, would be a new madness and a new blind street.
We must take on a new stage of European construction.
In order to form a republic in France, it was necessary to “be” Republicans.
The revolution in its interest could not be enough.
This lesson continues to apply.
We need to build a Europe that will be more economically integrated.
This can only be achieved by building a more politically democratic Europe and a genuine European democratic sovereignty.
Let’s become Europeans to build Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards are spreading
In an optimistic atmosphere, the world chip card fair will open on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris.
According to Eurosmart, the year 2011 is expected to end with a 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor cards (banking cards, SIM-card phones) to more than 6 billion units.
The most bearable is the segment of contactless technology, which allows you to pay in public transport or process purchases by simply bringing the card closer to the reader.
This year, 460 million chip cards are expected to be sold worldwide versus 320 million sold a year earlier!
Their share is expected to continue to rise in 2012 (an expected 580 million units) and reach about 10% of the total chip card market (6,925 million cards).
After a long time in APEC countries, Europe is gaining ground in contactless payments.
Approximately 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept them.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards have been issued.
But big business chains work for two.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million non-contact Pass MasterCards this year.
In order to rank a higher speed level, it is necessary for banks to equip their clients with them from now on.
“Two major French companies have committed to systematically distributing contactless bank cards to their customers in the future,” said Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing mobile payments
But this is only the first step towards the payment method of the future: a mobile phone.
The NFC (Near Field Communication) technology required for the execution of transactions is now only equipped with a small number of devices.
"They've been late."
"But their real break-up is expected to take place next year."
“For 2012, we estimate their worldwide sales at 80 to 120 million units,” explains Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks are already getting ready.
The Crédit agricole Bank announced yesterday the launch of a test in Caen, which will run from December to June next year.
Approximately 200 iPhone customers and employees will be equipped with a case that allows contactless payments.
Bank BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And also Société générale yesterday announced that it is preparing to introduce an offer allowing its clients to pay on their mobile phones without touch.
Terrorist Front Sahja from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about links between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Long-term suspicions of links between the Al-Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the Nigerian Boko Haram sect have been confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even admitted that Algeria had “acquired certainty” about it from now on.
"The way both organizations operate, and intelligence reports show that there is a great co-operation between them," he explained without further clarification.
Paris seems to have similar analyses.
Investigating the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger in January 2010 could help illuminate the connecting bridge.
After members of the AQMI were kidnapped from a restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day at the same time as several of their kidnappers in an operation carried out by French special forces.
In the aftermath of the attack, French and Nigerian investigators were to find several phones with chips belonging to terrorists.
Terrorist Axis
The analysis of the calls carried out leads to several persons in Mali, Nigeria and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in two figures: one leads to a Nigerian who has long lived in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria that is the bedrock of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who is said to have a BMI.
“It’s progress, but there’s no doubt that we need to wait for more convincing evidence before we start talking about operational cooperation between AQMI and Boko Haram.”
"But it's possible."
“We have known for years that the sect is enjoying external financial and intellectual support and is becoming increasingly active,” said Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian investigator.
In recent months, this "support" has been increasingly evident in the development and manifestations of Boko Haram or its operational practices, which now include human victims or increasingly complex explosive devices of the same implementation as those used by the AQMI.
The international community headed by Washington has since developed pressure on Nigeria to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have long considered the group to be a community of enlightened mystics of little worthwhile interest.
Fast successes.
The Boko Haram Sect was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around the mosque, school and fundamentalist Muhammad Yusuf. Boko Haram, which in the Haoussa language means "Western education is a sin", endorses the establishment of an Islamic Emirate in northern Nigeria.
In this poor region, such a connection has a rapid success.
The sect is politicizing and demands strict adherence to Islamic Sharia law, while its supporters are starting a fight against the central government.
These people focus first on churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, Boko Haram supporters became extremely active and have multiplied their attacks against police stations.
The government’s reaction, as usual, is still the same.
The army will encircle the city and result in 800 deaths.
The founder of the sect, Mohammed Yusuf, is captured and killed in prison.
Since then, the group has radicalized and is leaving its headquarters in the north.
At Christmas 2010, an assassination took place in Jos, killing 80 people, then another in the capital Abuja.
In June, it is again in Abuja, where Boko Haram attacks the police command in his first suicide attack.
And in August, the local UN office will be the first international destination.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which should lead from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, now worries all security specialists.
Now that Al-Qaeda of the Islamic Maghreb has encircled Mali and the Games and Somalis from the Al-Shabaab movement are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram emerges as a new threat to the continent.
Last week in Nigeria, in an interview with Goodluck President Jonathan Alain Juppé said France is in a state of emergency and is ready to "transmit all the information".
World by Presidential Candidates
When it comes to China, Iran or helping Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry are ahead in simplification and ignorance.
Can America manage the world through a weakened crisis with simple or even simplifying ideas?
In hearing the presidential candidates, voters might think so.
For several days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have been repeating gloomy statements and brief guidance on foreign policy, which is traditionally a strong point for Republicans.
Often unsubstantiated slogans about China, Iran, or helping Israel fuse with each other.
Mitt Romney, the best-looking candidate in the Republican Grand Old Party nomination race, threatened the Chinese profession before the World Trade Organization and accused them of "manipulating their currency", which is the main theme in America of the migration of entire Assyrians.
Even worse, if this must include the start of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama’s former ambassador to China and the only candidate with some sophisticated foreign policy vision, almost stumbled upon a stance that “accepts” emotions.
He demanded a hard but constructive dialogue with Beijing (President Obama’s current stance).
But Huntsman, who is in the last position in the election estimates, remains unheard of.
In the image of President Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop his nuclear program.
"If I'm elected, I'll imprison Iran," he said.
"If Obama is re-elected, they will have a bomb."
He also promised to increase military assistance to Israel, accusing Obama of disappointing in his obligations to this partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, demonstrates a shameful ignorance of documents.
Recently, he called for a sharp stance against the Chinese military threat because Beijing is "trying to develop nuclear capacities" - obviously unknown to the fact that China has had its own atomic weapons since 1964!
Texas governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, says he is ready to send U.S. troops to Mexico to fight the drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists banned by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Cain, Perry and another candidate Michelle Bachmann.
Everyone is far different from the 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president say Reagan also had simple ideas and yet won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he added water to his wine in the fight against terrorism.
They underline the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the urgent departure of the "boys" from Iraq, his excuses regarding Libya and thus attribute it to the sticker of the weak.
But the attack is not easy.
The population considers President Obama’s national security policy, which has removed Ben Laden, rather positively.
Iraq does not have confidence in military interventions that lead to aggravation.
And with the arguments that it is necessary to rebuild America economically in order to revive its leadership position, Obama is talking about the right place.
Nord Stream, the new Russian gas port of entry to Europe
The Nord Stream pipeline that connects Eastern Europe directly to Russia and runs along the bottom of the Baltic Sea began to operate.
It must supply gas equivalent to the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, a Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate this event properly.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, took part in the inauguration of the Nord Stream, a new gas pipeline that connects Russia and Germany directly under the sea.
Symbolically German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch colleague Mark Rutte have jointly turned the control valve of the Russian gas inlet into the Western European network.
With this new pipeline, an additional 27.5 billion cubic metres of Russian gas will flow into western Europe each year by the first 1,224 km long pipeline connecting the St. Petersburg region with the Mecklenburg-Pomeranian Commonwealth.
The second pipeline, to be completed at the end of 2012, will allow a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas to be supplied, which is the amount equal to the total French consumption.
And it is already recalled the possibility of building a third pipeline of the pipeline on the same route.
For Gazprom, the early completion of this huge construction has the character of victory.
Poland and the Baltic States strongly protested against the project.
In fact, Nord Stream will allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany without being flown through the country by any third country (Poland or Ukraine).
At the same time, these two countries are losing some power: the possibility of pressuring Russia with threats to block its access to western European markets is becoming more difficult for them.
Warsaw expressed this most strongly when it did not hesitate to compare Nord Stream to the "new German-Soviet Pact", with a reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin during the occupation of Poland in 1939.
It means to say that this is a politically sensitive topic.
With the support of this Russian project, Western Europe has gained greater certainty of its purchases.
But it is at the cost of weakening Europe's energy, because the project created gaps between the Europeans of the East and the West.
Only five years ago, Russia managed to implement its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich western countries with high gas consumption, whose camps are approaching their end.
“This pipeline is an integral part of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that organically connects us,” Fillon said at the opening ceremony of the pipeline, demonstrating at what point the major gas contracts of both political and economic matters are.
All this explains the wide smiles of Gazprom’s leading representatives present in large numbers in Lubmin, the gas supply site.
The construction of this pipeline is also an important technical act.
The undersea pipe is made of steel with a concrete coating to protect it from anchors of marine vessels.
It lies on the bottom of the sea at an average depth of 200 m.
During its construction, it was necessary to avoid mining fields dating back to World War II.
“For security reasons, almost a hundred of them had to be removed or destroyed,” said Jens Müller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to increase the protection of fauna and flora.
The pipeline itself is a long metal hose weighing like the 242 Eiffel, which is not interrupted anywhere by valves or maintenance stations.
One control platform was to be built near Sweden, but the project managers rejected it when the Swedes were little eager to see the Russian state-owned company permanently settled on their shores.
“In the event of a failure, we will stop gas flow in less than 1 minute,” says Jens Müller.
In the event of non-sealing, the gas contained in the pipeline will leak into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the builder, since welding was designed so that the opacity arose once every 100,000 years.
The state of the gas pipeline from the outside is checked by the submarine robot drawn by the ship, while the inside of the pipeline is checked by a device that circulates inside.
This 1 meter diameter cigar-shaped device is inserted into the interior of the pipe and is pressed by gas.
The target will provide accurate information about possible deformation of metal parts after three days of travel at 3 m/s.
The long-distance pipeline was designed to operate for fifty years without the slightest repair required.
The gas circulation is simply ensured by pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 bar at start and 100 bar at target.
Five companies have joined forces to implement this project.
Gazprom remains the leader of the group, which holds a 51% stake.
It was joined by German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch company Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have set up a joint venture called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the pipeline.
The company is based in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is extremely favourable.
Gazprom subsequently leased to the company all its gas transport capacities for a five-year contract which can be renewed.
“Gazprom will benefit from the total capacity, no matter how much gas is actually transported,” said Jens Müller.
The construction of the pipeline was financed by 30% of shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of work is expected to reach <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, the investment costs amounted to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure that their costs will be returned to them because Gazprom only takes the risk.
The pipeline originates from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on a sandy coast with pine forests.
Valves of 4.5 meters high form a gas outlet.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the incoming gas before it is transported to German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal receives one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
By reaching full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine - brand notebook
The Italian company Moleskine, which was founded fifty years ago, wants to bring back the joy of writing.
It brings the scent of adventure, hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable by its black rectangular boards and white sheets sent as if they were obsolete over time.
The Moleskine notebook, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan at the time, decided to launch a new design but distinctive notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant working for the company, is introducing a new product.
The notebook is inspired by the old production technique "moleskin" (skin imitation), which is used, for example, to adjust the surface of the benches.
This type of notebook was highly appreciated by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has returned to popularity an old and forgotten object that was an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the leader of the brand at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales rose by 26% to 12.7 million units last year.
The situation is a remote secret production from the first years, when only 3,000 notes were made.
Moleskine crosses Italian borders and is exported to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to compile some artificial portrait of the buyer, as the notebook will attract businessmen as well as students or professionals.
The image of Moleskine’s notebook includes that its owners are cosmopolitan, cultivated and open-minded people.
The small Italian company, which initially had 12 employees, now has almost a hundred of them and since 2008 has two offices, one in Milan and the other in New York.
He sends his notebooks to the bookstore and through the FNAC chain of stores to small shops in the city center, where he was able to promote his identity.
“We have followed the spirit of the time and this need for new writing, through the stormy development of emails,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of the Moleskine notebook: the brand recently opened the exhibition "Zaházka", where architects or artists exhibit their notebook.
In August, on the occasion of the film festival in Locarno, she also introduced new record labels reminiscent of a leopard.
Moleskine benefits from its success and this cultural aura and diversifies its products: bags, diaries, pencils, laptop case ... The brand extends to a wide range of carriers.
Success that sparked jealousy: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by investment funds SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is there such a high proportion of unemployed workers?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
Today is the 15th week for the employment of disabled people.
Despite the voluntary public policy introduced in 2005, the percentage of unemployed persons with disabilities is twice as high as the average, i.e. 19% versus 9% for the whole population.
Is it slippery?
"No," said Éric Blanchet, CEO of the Adapt Association, which organizes the Week for the Employment of the Disabled.
"The progress made in 15 years is remarkable."
“At the time, the percentage of unemployed was not twice, but three times higher.”
"However, there is still a lot to do."
It should be said that for the unemployed persons with disabilities, numerous obstacles persist before they get to work.
These are older people: 37% are over 50 years of age (17% on average).
They are low-skilled: 80% do not graduate and out of 2.3 million college students, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% of disabled people versus 38% on average.
In short, these are the criteria that make it particularly difficult to return to work and which are "the core of the problem," according to Christian Grapina, the general manager of the Tremplin Association, which was founded in 1992 to help businesses accept disabled workers.
As far as the lens brakes are concerned.
It remains unspeakable, ways of thinking that are certainly evolving, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the association IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité found that the managers questioned had a “weak level of knowledge of persons with disabilities” with an “exaggerated view of persons in a wheelchair and mental or mentally impaired”.
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the target of employing 6% of disabled workers set out in the Act of 1987.
The last known figures, dating back to 2008, indicate a state of 2.6%.
“We are now moving around 3%,” says Pierre Blanc, the general manager of Agefiph, who is responsible for collecting fees from companies that do not comply with this law.
The evidence is the number of "financed" undertakings, as well as the amounts paid, which fell from 59,000 incumbent undertakings between 2007 and 2011 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which increased contributions, created a strong pressure on businesses," explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also demonstrates real awareness, especially in large enterprises."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of enterprises with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared with 82% of enterprises with 100 to 199 employees.
Gambling: "What luck"
Before the French teams (Bleus), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens called out on Tuesday night, they did not hide the pleasure that this friendly match would bring them.
We will not go so far as to write that there was a union between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other at the Stade de France Theatre, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard were briefly reconciled.
Five months after his attacker’s angry gesture in a match against Turkey, the Belgian coach gave his player only words of praise.
“I am very pleased with Eden and his progress, and with the fact that he loves his country.”
"I want to move forward," assures the French Lille player.
As for the difference between his performances in club matches and national team matches," it's the same, it's excused."
"I'm in Lille all year, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I need to clean up my brand."
Hazard, who was investigated against Romania on Thursday evening because of this match against France, comes to the stadium in Saint-Denis to finally "flame".
The concept of “joy” cannot be overlooked.
Play against Bleus, which he encouraged from the age of 7, and in their winning draws in 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been a fan," he says.
This necessarily contributes even more to the "special" character of this meeting.
This is more because, in contrast, "they are Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) ", he recalls.
"We were immediately baptized."
"You can play against them, it's just a pleasure!"
Leekens kindly reminded me of "the pride".
"Pride" to fight"fight - holiday".
"Pride" also notes in the quality of "neighbors" that France has become a very high-level team a little more than a year after the trauma in the South African city of Knysna "again".
“Laurent Blanc did a great job,” he said.
Although Belgium will be missing at the next European Championship, a technical footballer would like to see himself in 2014 on a plane with the French... Brazil.
"Our little Belgians are going to be great," he said.
"We're building something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You'll know for the next game." Including against France.
Portugal is very self-confident
Portugal coach Paulo Bento is starting a bargain against Bosnia Bosnia with great optimism (22h00) this Wednesday in Lisbon.
On the way there, both teams lacked realism.
“At the end of those 90 minutes we will be a happy team and above all a happy country.”
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no shadow of doubt for him. The Portuguese football team, whose steering wheel has been since 2010, qualifies for Euro 2012.
Portugal is actually 90 minutes apart from luck.
There remains to be played one match and one opponent - Bosnia.
Being aware of Friday's score (0-0) in the Bosnian Zenice hell, it seems clear that nothing is won.
Portugal certainly had more than an hour of dominance, but it was not able to score such a rare goal that would ease it.
"It's a good result, but it's a risk, because we didn't score outside."
But at their stunning Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will move in front of the audience, which should create a boiling boiler there, even though the match definitely appears to be "very balanced", says the optimist, but certainly considering Bento.
"We expect a very balanced game, but we are absolutely convinced that we can have a top," said the 40-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012," Carlos Queiroze said.
The indecisive Friday match in Bosnia forces Portugal to score and win.
An indecisive match can be enough for Bosnians, who also need to score.
"It's a good result, but it's a risk, because we didn't score outside," Bento said.
"We will play against a team that has great technical qualities and that has players with great individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will have an interest in developing the maximum pressure on the Bosnian team from the very beginning so as not to give them time to think.
A good idea, provided that this time it turns out to be realistic.
