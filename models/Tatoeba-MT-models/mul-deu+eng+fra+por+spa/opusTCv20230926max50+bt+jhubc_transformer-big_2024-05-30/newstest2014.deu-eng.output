Gutach: More safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 meters away: on Tuesday in Gutach the new B 33 pedestrian ramp at the village parking lot was put into operation - in view of the old city hall.
Two plants so close to each other: intention or shielding?
Mr Gutach’s mayor answered this question clearly yesterday.
"The city hall sampling was installed at the time because it secured the school path," Eckert explained yesterday.
The Kluser lamps are safe for cyclists as well as bus passengers and the Bergle residents.
The plant officially launched yesterday is important for the intersection of Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße.
We have the museum, two churches, a spa park, a bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the <0xE2><0x80><0xBA>Grub<0xE2><0x80><0xB9> residential area.
"At the high traffic and pedestrian traffic, another light had to be produced for their safety," says Eckert.
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold of the Landratsamt Offenburg.
"According to current measurements, at the B 33 around 12,000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Gutach every day, of which about ten percent are heavy cargo traffic," Arnold stresses.
Therefore, the construction of another lamp is more than necessary: “Security is simply going on here,” says Arnold.
A total of four traffic inspections have been carried out, a circular traffic has also been envisaged, but due to the narrowness in the intersection of Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße again discarded.
According to Arnold, everything was tested before the location of the lampposts: "With an extra wooden transporter loaded with particularly long rods for us, we have tested whether these vehicles can get out of the Sulzbachweg to the B 33 without overturning the lampposts".
The approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15,000 lamp itself is “the most modern thing on the market at the moment,” explained Arnold.
The system is equipped with colored LEDs that light up so strongly that the lights from the drivers can be easily detected, for example, even in the deep sun.
And it’s also economical: the older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new ones just eight watts.
There are three lighting systems per drive direction.
Arnold explained the technology of the new plant: it is equipped with two radar sensors.
When the pedestrian pushes the light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
If the road is free, it will immediately come green for the pedestrian, if not, it will take about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be terminated for the pedestrian.
"If a group or people with disabilities cross the road, the green phase will be extended, so everyone will safely cross the road," Arnold said.
Of course, the driver has to think here as a partner and observe the road.
This was not the case yesterday: barely showed the lights for pedestrians green, a top-class vehicle came through - with bright red.
Josef Winkler has been writing about the needs of his childhood and youth for more than 30 years.
The disasters of his Catholic village childhood – speechlessness, the tendency to raw violence and stupid sexuality, the closeness and discomfort – have been described many times by the Carinthian poet.
The Büchner Prize winner is known primarily as a prose author, theatrical texts are rare in his work.
Collage made of prostate texts Gerhard Fresacher makes a collage made of prostate texts for his performance "Wetter lamps at the tip of the tongue", which can now be seen in the garage X at St. Peter's Square.
The theater maker combines elements from the autobiographical novel "Der Leibbeigene" (1987) with prosaminatures from "Leichnam, his family bewildering" (2003).
On the largely empty stage - an important requirement: a cracked sofa, on which is implicitly copulated and masturbated - the eight-headed ensemble hangs through the text material.
Director Fresacher seems to have little confidence in the text.
The 70-minute performance overwhelms the template with a plethora of directorial hits, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms of play.
Above all, the actresses sometimes come up with some questionable scenic performances.
They are hard touched, with their head submerged in water, tapped to the wall with their evening clothes.
Enforced in cellophane or mieder, they stagger at dangerously high kicks through the stage, either monologize them loudly or lie completely blurred on the stage floor.
However, the text is scarcely conveyed in this strenuous way.
The best moments have the evening when it is sung - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to folk songs.
It is not until the end that the overwhelming performance comes to a halt, and Winkler’s rear-ended absurd humour flashes.
A black box in the car?
U.S. road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the declining highway system, and believe they have found the solution in a small black box that takes place in each car’s armor board.
The devices that record every kilometre travelled and report the information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the federal planning offices to revise the outdated system to finance U.S. roads.
The usually rather boring area of road planning has suddenly triggered an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertarians have allied themselves with environmental groups and agree that the government can use the small boxes to record the kilometres traveled – and possibly where they were driven – and then use the information to calculate tax returns.
The tea party is scary.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of privacy concerns.
But while one cannot agree on a move in Congress, several states are no longer waiting.
They are currently examining how they can switch over the next ten years to a system where drivers pay per mile.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the driving recorders, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This is truly a must for our country.
“It’s nothing we’ll only use,” Hasan Ikhrata, CEO of Southern California Assn. of Governments, said in a statement, which plans to record all Californian drivers’ mileage from 2025 onwards.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology is there for that.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is funded from the taxes that Americans pay at the bargaining column, is pledging.
In America, however, it is no longer used as much as it used to be.
Cars consume less fuel.
The state mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 euros per liter) has not increased in 20 years.
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax by just a cent at high spike prices.
“The gasoline tax is simply not future-proof,” said Lee Munnich, an expert on traffic legislation at the University of Minnesota.
His state has recently equipped 500 cars with steering wheels to test a mile-based payment system.
“This is the most meaningful alternative in the long run,” he said.
Officers call it a mile-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea is sound to urban liberals, for example, because the tax could be used to influence driving behavior in such a way that lockdown and climate-harmful emissions are reduced.
The California planners rely on the system in developing strategies to achieve the state’s ambitious, legally anchored goals on climate change.
But Republican Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also stated that he sees the most common long-term alternative.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also motivated by the idea of letting drivers pay for the route.
“This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole,” explains Adrian Moore, Vice President of Policy at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers, who in a 2011 report called on Congress to move towards mile-based billing.
Last year, the U.S. Senate approved a <0x24>90 million pilot project involving 10,000 cars.
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the move and thereby responded to the concerns of MEPs from rural areas, who represent people who often have to travel many miles back to work or to the city in everyday life.
However, several states and major cities are moving on their own in this direction.
The most engaged is Oregon, which currently recruits 5,000 drivers for the country’s largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of the mineral oil tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering this.
Illinois tests it to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently exploring how the amendment could be introduced.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the equipment, drivers were skeptical about the government’s ability to track any of their movements.
“Concerning Big Brother and things like that was a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, Head of Strategy and Results Management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
The people didn't want it.
When the test started, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: “It would be relatively easy to turn the steering wheel into adult monitoring devices.”
There is no need to build a gigantic, disruptive technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data about the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology, with which the state can record the kilometres travelled, but not exactly when and where.
So, Khan said, the public would be quieter too.
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The company did not initially take part in assisting states in taxing drivers.
Rather, it was their goal to step into an emerging market for car insurance, where drivers were supposed to pay based on the mileage.
But the devices tested by her are also interesting for road planners, as they do not work with GPS and only provide limited information that is regularly uploaded via modem.
“People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded,” said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
In some of these public pilot programs, major mistakes have been made.
There are significantly cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.
In Oregon, planners experiment with giving drivers a range of options.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they do not choose a device at all and instead pay a flat-rate fee based on the average mile travelled by all residents of the state.
Other agencies hope to be able to sell the concept to a suspicious public by equiping the devices with more features than with less.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a taxation device that also allows parking fees to be paid, insurance only has to be paid for kilometres driven, and speed data collected from other vehicles in real time, thanks to which drivers can avoid stagnation.
“During the added value of the benefits offered by the system, drivers would be motivated to participate,” says a city planning document.
However, some traffic planners wonder if the whole talk about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area, officials said Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by raising fuel taxes.
An additional one-time fee or an annual fee could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little gasoline, so that they also pay a fair share.
“There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is enough,” said Randy Rentschler, the Commission’s head of legislation and public affairs.
When we do, hundreds of millions of drivers are worried about their privacy and many other things.
Königsfeld: Small team is waking up
The Volunteer Fire Department handled its autumn test despite staff shortages with bravour.
Only 11 men participated in the exercise.
Division commander Hans Kammerer had chosen in his exercise as the property of Feder in Burgberger Straße.
There is supposed to be a short-circuit.
Two people were injured by the resulting fire and smoke development, but one of them was able to send an emergency call.
After Hans Kammerer’s first inspection of the situation, two air defense officers of the Wehrmacht prepared to enter the building.
After a short period of time, he managed to find the first person and lead to the free.
The second person had to be worn.
This was not so easy, as there was also a narrow staircase to overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stalling for two horses, was not easy to secure.
It stored a lot of wood and also straw balls in it.
There were also electric machines for woodworking.
The first clearance attempt was carried out via the tank in the vehicle.
Another line was carried out via an excess hydrant at a distance of about 100 meters.
Now three deletion handles could be designed.
A hollow beam tube was also used in the building.
In the exercise, Hans Kammerer also went on to show what to do with little available staff.
In a serious case, support will be provided through the day-to-day use group Königsfeld.
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise.
Networking of universities and companies is important
During his visit to the Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald county, Landtag President Guido Wolf also made himself aware in Titisee-Neustadt about where the workers of tomorrow came from.
In the promotion centre Hochschwarzwald, he worked with the managing directors of the vocational schools and the district gymnasium and the chairpersons of the parental council on this important issue.
"Education is an important location factor," said Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans-Thoma School, which presented the interconnected school project Education Center Hochschwarzwald.
In doing so, Wolf was impressed with the model projects for training.
Since 2011, there has been a successful collaboration in the Walderstadt between the Förderzentrum, Kreisgymnasium and Vocational School Center.
He also praised the family friendlyness in the county.
“It is important not only to look at the family phase, but because of the demographic change as well as the phase of care for relatives,” Wolf said.
In addition, he pointed out that more and more employees took care of the care and care of their relatives.
"Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to the employment relationship," Wolf said.
But no one can afford to lose a qualified workforce, he continued.
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and businesses.
"For those who have already learned the advantages of the region during their studies, with their acquired knowledge and skills, will often retain the regional economy, which contributes to the strengthening of the region," said the president of the country.
For only if sufficient training spaces were offered, the needs of professionals could also be met.
According to him, the location advantage of the district is its advantageous location in the southwest of Germany, in close proximity to France and Switzerland.
In addition, on his train journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg, he experienced the already undertaken efforts to expand public passenger transport.
“Keep on being persistent and make sure that public transport improves,” he told the address of the local politicians in attendance.
Experience a fun afternoon with music
For 15 years, the Kaul family has been inviting Dieting seniors to coffee, cakes and then to a Vesper.
In the past, the elderly fellow citizens were returned to the resting place.
In the meantime, this afternoon takes place in the St. Josef nursing home.
The locals looked forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later there was sausage salad.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich were entertained with common melodies.
The more than 100-year-old natural stone wall as a frontal demarcation of the old school hall to Kirchstraße is to be added again to the renovation cost plan of the city of Bräunlingen.
In the days before the Kilbig, a small corner wall was installed for stabilization and static relief of the more than one hundred-year-old natural stone wall with balustrade during the first renovation work of the front school hall.
The next step is to include the Landsdenkmalamt in the planning and create a rehabilitation concept for the old wall, according to Alexander Misok of the Braunlinger Town Hall.
After that, a cost calculation will be made by professionals, which will then be put on the table for the municipal council to decide and decide on the next procedure.
A decision on this is expected to fall in the coming year.
After the renovation, plastering and tree planting of the old school yard within the two side wings of the school built in 1912, as a follow-up, the rehabilitation-needed confinement wall must be rebuilt from scratch and rebuilt in a new substructure.
The historic, one-hundred-year-old demarcation wall of the old school hall to the church street, is mainly due to water and frost damage, as there is no drainage, needs rehabilitation and has a bow tilt forward.
Deep cracks in individual stones are evidence of weather damage, but the wall is not currently at risk of collapse.
A stable wall is a prerequisite for a schoolyard used by students, which is done through the current fixing work.
Initially, school court rehabilitation was planned even in 2008/2009, but high unplanned expenditures brought a shift.
An important word in the historical school wall renovation, which has already been used for filming, will be addressed by the Landesdenkmalat.
If specifications come from this page, then the city of Bräunlingen hopes for grants from the monumental protectors.
Students of the Bräunlinger Primary School, who are now being taught again in a well-sanitized old school building with a new classroom, can soon use the old school courtyard.
<0xC3><0x96>zdemir wants jazz training in Stuttgart
Cem <0xC3><0x96>zdemir, Federal President of the Greens, has also been involved in the ongoing discussions about the future of the music schools in Baden-Württemberg.
"I think it's wrong to give up the holistic education at the Musikhochschule Stuttgart," <0xC3><0x96>zdemir told "Stuttgarter Nachrichten".
Jazz and classical music belong together at the jazz venue Stuttgart.
In this way, <0xC3><0x96>zdemir, who is considered a favourite for a direct mandate in the federal parliamentary elections on 22 September, opposes the Green-Red National Government.
Based on an expert study, this is forcing a restructuring of the five music schools in Baden-Württemberg.
Afterwards, the study program Jazz and Pop will be transferred from the Musikhochschule Stuttgart to the Musikhochschule Mannheim, among others.
U.S. Border: ‘Super Tunnel’ Discovered for Drug Smuggling
At the border between Mexico and the United States, investigators have discovered and shut down a “super tunnel” for drug smuggling.
According to the US customs authorities, the more than 500-meter-long pipeline between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, railroad and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were arrested, eight tons of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine were seized.
The tunnel had not yet been used, according to the data.
“These cartels are stupid if they think they could dig themselves under the radar,” U.S. District Attorney General Laura Duffy told a news conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where an end of the tunnel was discovered.
Addressing the drug gangs, Duffy assured: “If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make it a huge waste of your dirty money.”
Both the U.S. authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a lasting battle against the drug cartel.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico due to drug crime.
Designed by Experts
Due to the demanding equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was designed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year.
It was equipped in such a way that electric carriages could be used there.
On the Mexican side is the access to a building that is 80 meters from the border.
According to authorities, a conductor leads 20 meters deep to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross section of 1.20 meters high and 90 centimeters wide.
He would also have been able to promote illegal immigration to the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine fund.
The third, a Mexican, was arrested because of the confiscated marijuana.
All three threaten to be sentenced to life imprisonment, officials said.
Eight such tunnels have been discovered since 2006, it continued at a press conference in San Diego.
This is the first time that cocaine has been found in such a tunnel.
Usually, cocaine is smuggled in smaller amounts and not through tunnels.
This shows the “desperation” of drug gangs whose traditional routes have now been cut off, said Bill Sherman of the DEA Drug Enforcement Agency in San Diego.
They would do anything to get to the United States.
There were no details of the detainees, at least one being Mexican, it said.
You have to face up to 10 years in prison.
2014 will be Geisinger's holiday year
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of 1250.
The return of the first urdumental mention is getting closer and closer.
If the year ends in eight weeks, the jubilee year will end.
Geisingen and church houses were mentioned together for the first time in 794.
In churches, a document was made that mentions both places.
On March 15, there will be an official opening for the anniversary year, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, this opening event will take place in the place where both were first mentioned 1250 years ago, in Kirchen-Hausen.
As part of the anniversary, several events are planned in Geisingen as well as in Kirchen-Hausen.
Church Houses will be held in July on a festive weekend from 18 to 20 July 1250.
Celebrate again.
On Friday with a party, on Saturday and Sunday with a party around the church hall.
This weekend is also the Church-Hausener Church Festival.
City Music Director Rudolf Barth has written an order composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary, which will be performed on three dates.
On 21 June together with the celebration of the Black Forest Association, on 12 July in the arena with fireworks and on 13 December as the first concert of city music in the new Festhalle.
It is completed in the jubilee year and inaugurated, the official date is on the last weekend of September, on 27 and 28 September.
On the occasion of the Geisinger City Anniversary, a new chronicle will also be released.
"But it is meant to be a chronicle not only of Geisingen itself, but a printed work on Geisingen today, which consists of Geisingen, Kirchenhäuser, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen," said Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And also the singing of today celebrates 2014 birthday, 1974 the present space with the municipalities was fulfilled.
The new Chronicle will be presented on 21 or 22 November in the new Festhalle in Geisingen.
2014 is also another year with many jubilees.
The Narrenzunft Strohglonki begins on February 8th with an evening of worship on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, the Harmonie Gutmadingen will be 90 years old and on March 29th will have the festive banquet and will then celebrate the district music festival from May 1 to 4th.
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen will be 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been in the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May, the music association Polyhymnia Leipferdingen will be 150 years old and celebrates this as part of the fountain festival from 4 to 7 July.
The town of Geisingen was first mentioned in a donation document, which is owned by the Monastery of St. Gallen, in 764.
The document was made in churches (houses), which at the time was court place.
Therefore, both municipalities are mentioned in the same document.
As a reason for celebrating this 1250th anniversary in 2014, in addition, the municipal reform is still 40 years back.
Council Takes Glue Plants into Visibility
Should the "Am Hirschen" railway transition be extensively rebuilt in order to increase traffic safety?
Yes, the municipal councils have decided.
Schiltach has to take <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>220,000.
Deutsche Bahn intends to improve the Kinzigtal railway line next year.
In particular, the safety of rail crossings should be increased - there are regularly collisions of trains with other vehicles across the country.
If the municipalities agree to the amendment measures, they must participate by one third in the costs, the rest will be shared by rail and by the federal government.
Schiltach City Builder Roland Grießhaber explained to the municipal council the specialities of the railway transition "Am Hirschen".
There the city plans to build an excavation at the height of the tunnel to the west of the railway line.
Larger vehicles, such as those carrying long wood, could also be on counter-traffic without having to block the road.
Grieshhaber therefore proposed to construct a necessary support wall so that the city could spread the following road at a given time in order to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was controversial in the municipal council, as some councils questioned the need for street circulation: Thomas Kipp brought the critics’ mood to the point: "Should we take so much money into our hands because of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas disagreed: The railway transition "Hirschen" is regularly used for long wood transport.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area is partly transported over this route because the vehicles up to 20 meters long could not use the route at the Häberles Bridge because they could not turn there to the main road.
In addition, the route serves as a redirection for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is blocked, Haas argued.
Since it is foreseeable that the Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels should be rebuilt and renovated, as is the case at the moment in Wolfach, the "Am "Hirschen" railway transition could also be important for a longer period of time.
The councils agreed to investigate what costs would be caused by the planned expansion of the road.
Nonetheless, the redevelopment of the railway crossing was agreed by a majority with the measure that the necessary support wall will be built so that the city can expand the next road in the direction of "Bahnhofstraße" if necessary for meeting traffic to about 5.5 meters.
On the other hand, the conversion of the railway crossing at the Gerberei Trautwein could lead to a completely different problem, which concerns access to the highly increasing "Geroltzhäuser Weg".
The administration had to investigate the remodeling plans of the railway from the engineering office of Breinlinger, as it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhausen Weg would then be possible without further ado.
The investigation concluded that it could not be ruled out that the tilt conditions on the road could lead to longer cars sitting.
The responsibility for this, in turn, lies with the city as a road builder.
The restructuring can therefore lead to liability disputes.
Since both the timber flow and the bending functioned in the current state of expansion, one should not agree to the conversion of the railway transition, Haas argued.
Also at this point the risk of collision of the train with a vehicle on the transition is considerably lower than on the other rail crossings, because directly adjacent to the stop centre to which there is a good visual connection.
Even trains from the main train station would have to be braked at this point to the point where there is no danger of collision.
The majority refused to approve the redevelopment of this railway transition, as the city of Schiltach had to "examinate the problem with sedentary vehicles," the council said, as the railway could withdraw from responsibility after completion of the construction work.
The committee considers that it is unproblematic the reconstructions at the railway crossings "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach", for which crossing agreements with the railway have already been made.
Esa decides on major space missions: missions for billions
Remote planets, gravitational waves or black holes - European space agency experts must now agree on two major projects they want to start in the next few years.
There were 30 proposals to choose from, five are still in the race.
Far away worlds.
Astronomers have already found more than 1,000 planets in other stars.
Whether there is life on at least some of them, no one knows.
The choice is difficult: Should we look for gravitational waves?
Or do you prefer to explore the origins of the cosmos?
Or search for Earth-like planets and discover extraterrestrial life?
These questions are being asked by the European Space Agency (ESA).
For their Cosmic Vision program, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that are designed to decisively advance research.
The state for such "L-missions" is approximately one billion euros each.
The launch is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
In early September, the elite of European space exploration met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
Thirty ideas were debated, five of which have now come into narrower elections.
Numerous bodies reviewed the proposals, followed by the researchers.
In the coming days, a final decision will be taken by the Scientific Programme Committee.
In total, Esa has chosen four major questions to which the missions of the Cosmic Vision programme initiated in 2007 are to find answers.
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?
The exact processes in the formation of stars from large gas clouds – and thus the formation of planets that orbit these stars – are still in the literal darkness.
A large infrared telescope in the universe could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has a planet, under what circumstances can life be created there?
In order to address this issue, the Cheops Space Telescope is scheduled to launch in 2017, with which 500 already known planetary systems in our immediate vicinity will be investigated in more detail.
However, the possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, astronomers could image Earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres, thus looking for "biomarkers": gases that are considered to be an indication of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question is also meant to ultimately give an explanation of the conditions for the emergence of life.
An important role is played by the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as the particle radiation from it with the planetary system.
In our solar system, these processes can be investigated exemplaryly.
With the "Solar Orbiter", Esa has already approved an M-Class mission (where the budget is about half a billion euros) for this issue.
The probe is set to launch in 2017 and closely monitor the surface and activity of the sun.
Jupiter and its moons are also of great interest to the researchers.
They want to find out what role the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system.
This is the first of the three L missions of the Cosmic Vision program.
The Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer (Juice) is expected to begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later, it reaches Jupiter and is intended to explore the planet’s atmosphere as well as the ice moons Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The universe offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and to investigate whether the laws of nature known to us are still valid there.
Perhaps there are also variations that could show physicists the way to a new theory under which all known laws of nature can unite.
What is the origin of the universe and what does it consist of?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was formed by the Urknall.
In addition to the common matter of the stars, planets, and living beings like us, there is dark matter whose gravity unites galaxies and galaxies, and dark energy which accelerates the expansion of the universe.
So far, the researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first fractions of the Urknall, nor do dark matter and dark energy exist.
With "Euclid", Esa has already approved an M mission, which is scheduled for launch in 2020.
Using a special telescope, the probe is intended to examine the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time across the entire sky, thus allowing conclusions on the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could do the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection process.
The best chances of a license as an L-mission have, according to many experts, "E-Lisa", a sophisticated concept for the detection of gravitational waves.
Physicists understand changes in the structure of spacetime that Albert Einstein predicted nearly 100 years ago.
They have not been proven to this day.
Elisa could do this, hope the scientists behind the project.
The mission provides a detector consisting of two or three probes, which is stationed in space.
Unlike plants on Earth, it could also prove gravitational waves that originated in the Urknall, thus providing new insights into the formation of the cosmos.
Four other proposals are still competing for the second L mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena", which is intended to explore black holes, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Find Prism", a mission to measure the outermost planets, and to measure the outermost planets.
Proposals have already been excluded, among other things, for sample back transport from Mars, for exploration of the moon, Venus and asteroids, as well as for solar physics.
Snowden is ready to "cooperate" with Germany on U.S. surveillance
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of the U.S. Intelligence Service, said he was willing to travel to Berlin and say before the German Bundestag if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director, Keith Alexander, do not give answers about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he received asylum, to discuss the statement with him in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, presented by Ströbele to the media in Berlin on Friday, he writes: “Even though the result of my efforts has been proven to be positive, my government continues to treat a divergent opinion as a breach of allegiance and attempts to make political statements with threat of punishment.”
To tell the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community could convince the American government to drop the charge against him.
The charges raised by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Time Online: “If Mr. Snowden is willing to talk to German representatives, we will find ways to make it possible.”
Relations between the U.S. and Germany are strained by allegations that the NSA has heard the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the MP who heads the parliamentary committee responsible for the intelligence service, said the opportunity should be taken to listen to Snowden as a witness, if possible, "without jeopardizing him and completely ruining relations with the United States".
Ströbele, a Greens MP, posted a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Ströbele said that according to the lawyer of former NSA employee Snowden, he could not return to Russia if he left the country.
When Snowden speaks in Germany, he needs assurance that he is “safe” there, the MP said.
In his letter, Snowden explains that he is exposed to a “serious and ongoing” persecution campaign that has driven him out of his homeland.
However, he is affected by the global response to “my act of political expression”.
Citizens around the world as well as senior politicians – including in the United States – have described the revelations of an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a merit to the general public.
In his letter, Snowden makes an offer to the German authorities to cooperate “if the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been solved”.
Frontier Airlines charges fees for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to demand up to <0x24>100 from passengers who want to store hand luggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to <0x24>100 for a piece of hand luggage and <0x24>2 for coffee or lemonade, although the announcement on Wednesday said passengers were allowed to keep the whole can.
The new fee applies to hand luggage in the luggage compartment above the seat, small bags under the seat are still free.
Frontier said it would cost <0x24>25 if the fee was paid in advance, and <0x24>100 for passengers who only paid on board.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the <0x24>100 fee aims to move travelers to take care of the payment in advance.
“We don’t want to calculate that amount,” she said.
In 2008, airlines began to charge fees for the first and second baggage that was given up.
Passengers who tried to circumvent these have, therefore, stuck as much as possible in the hand luggage, which results in the luggage compartments often over the seat being overcrowded.
Fees are a way to move passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said the new fee is not really about making money.
It’s about Frontier’s most loyal customers, who would have made it clear that it would be increasingly difficult to find a place in the office above the seat.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline’s website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger may be able to carry a piece of luggage free of charge at the frontier flight, but the next person must pay <0x24>100 for a comparable piece of luggage.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's website and check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers would be informed about the fee before arriving on board.
Frontier’s new baggage fee will not come into effect until summer, there is not yet an exact date.
Passengers often shy away from baggage surcharges and other fees, but airlines like to resort to them.
They argue that transporting the luggage costs money and passengers should pay for this service if they wish.
Many on Wall Street consider the new baggage fees to be a sign that airlines are taking enough money to cover the cost of flying after years of losses.
However, so far, most of them leave their fingers on fees for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. claimed first fees for hand luggage three years ago and later followed Allegiant Air, also a low-cost airline.
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said Airline Advisor Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the additional fees.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that Spirit’s hand luggage fee was <0x24>50 million a year.
Sorensen, who previously held a leadership position at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and was curious about what he would expect on board if passengers faced the company’s unusual baggage fee.
“The boarding process was one of the most smooth I’ve experienced in my aviation career,” he said.
I expected to see toothbrushes and handy discussions on the flight.
“The plane was full,” he explained, “and the boarding ran like lubricated.”
Frontier also follows Spirit for the <0x24>2 required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company stated that passengers who bought lemonade or juice could keep the whole can and coffee will be refilled free of charge.
Water is still free.
In 2008, US Airways briefly tried to demand money for refreshments, but resigned seven months later after passengers had complained and no other major company had pursued them.
Frontiers’ move to collect fees for hand luggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to guide customers to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz <0x24>10 to <0x24>25 per ticket sold.
This provides an incentive for all companies to move passengers to direct purchase with them instead of via an online travel agency.
Frontier, however, has gone the most far in this area.
In September, the company began to issue only half as many multi-flying miles when booking via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the mileage was again reduced to 25 percent of the flight route.
A flight booked with a third-party provider with a frontier of more than 1000 miles, therefore, only 250 miles are available to customers.
Passengers can also reserve seats exclusively when purchasing directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its Denver headquarters, but the business shrinks and the company loses money.
Earnings fell by 9 percent and flight capacity shrunk by just 13 percent in the first quarter, according to the financial report released by the parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc. on Wednesday.
Republic has attempted to get Frontier’s finances in hand as part of the sale of the company.
Proverbs come from the Bible
About 40 women attended this year’s last women’s breakfast in the evangelical church of Bisingen.
The theme of the day at the town hall was "Speaks from the Bible" and "Rememberings from the Middle Ages".
After breakfast, Zita Köhler, the chairman of the church council, gave a lecture on the Bible proverbs.
"Speech words contain life-wisdoms, regulations, or warnings," she explained.
She compared several proverbs to the corresponding Bible passages and explained the meaning.
She called proverbs such as: “Beware of timber, as crumbs fall from the eyes, tossing an eye on someone, giving his own to the Lord in sleep, washing his hands in innocence.”
On several occasions, the speaker also allowed her listeners to guess what the proverb was.
Christel Dehner, the church councillor of the Middle Ages, said: All good things are three, making blue, making something omitted.
She explained the meaning and origin of the phrases she called "bridges into the past".
In the end, a tombola was released.
The prizes were covered on a table and were humorously rewritten before being handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors to the breakfast round was also Mayoral candidate Roman Waizenegger.
Learning instead of unemployment: Pilot project for untrained people in tourism
At the Mecklenburg Lake Platte, a pilot project for the tourism industry was launched.
Under the direction of the Federal Labour Agency, 49 women and men, who already work as untrained in the industry, will be qualified as specialists for hotels and guest houses over three winters.
"The new thing is that the six-month courses end with graduations," said Carmen Wiechert of the Labour Agency Neubrandenburg.
The benefits are varied: the participants would not be unemployed, the companies would get trained professionals, who are increasingly lacking in hotels and hostels, and the agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The industrial and trade chambers in Neubrandenburg and the German Hotel and Gaststättenverband (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern are also involved in the project.
NSA declares an “internal error” and not a hacker to be guilty of the site crash
The shady National Security Agency said late Friday that a bug smashed its public website for a few hours and not hackers, as claimed online.
“NSA.gov was unavailable for a few hours tonight because an internal error occurred during a planned update,” the spy agency said in an emailed message.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack was not true.
Early in the evening, online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was unavailable for at least six hours, and this is still not the case for some users.
Earlier, a spokesman for the NSA told ABC News that the sensitive internal network of the agency was "no way" compromised.
Secret information is not in danger, the spokesman said.
At least one group of hackers claimed to have smuggled the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target site is flooded with page calls until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
The cyber tactics are relatively simple and the attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former supersecret NSA, once nicknamed No Such Agency, is now in the light of the public, and looks after the revelations made known in recent months about its extensive surveillance program, which has been elaborated in-house and overseas, and has been subjected to severe criticism.
The growing controversy over the intelligence service sparked initial speculation that the incident today was the result of a targeted Cyper operation.
The number of people without jobs dropped slightly in October by 22 to 1,307.
While the quota is 3.1 percent better than last year and also better than in September, “we would have hoped for more,” says Monika Felder-Bauern, Deputy Managing Director of the Labour Agency in Sonthofen.
Since so far, many companies have reacted to settings.
One reason for this is according to Felder-Bauer: "We have hardly any specialists in crafts, health care and care for the elderly".
Since September, job offers for staff in the hotel and hospitality industry have also been reopening due to the season.
In mid-December the winter season starts there.
The full background report for this can be found in the Allgäu bulletin of 31.10.2013 (page 33).
Bombardier’s profits after decreasing delivery and orders
Canadian aircraft and rail manufacturer Bombardier Inc. reported a 15 percent decline in net profit on Thursday after it was under pressure from downward orders and deliveries to aircraft in the third quarter as well as contract problems in the rail sector.
Bombardier, headquartered in Montreal, also did not release flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information on whether the aircraft could go into commercial use in accordance with the ambitious schedule for next September.
Only three more launches followed the test aircraft’s virgin flight a month and a half ago, which makes it questionable whether the test phase is running as planned.
The results remained behind forecasts and led to a price drop of over eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, on Thursday lowered his rating from “outperformance” to “sector performance” in view of the fact that the stock has a limited exchange potential in the next one to two quarters.
“While weaker deliveries for aircraft were largely expected, we are clearly disappointed by the development of margins in the transport sector,” Doerksen said in a customer letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the test program for the aircraft progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical of the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft series can catapult the company into the lower market segment, which is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flew after months of delays for the first time in September.
However, so far, binding orders for the CSeries with 177 are moderate, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and want to see if the company’s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost-saving potential of the new nozzle transport aircraft are true.
Currently there are a total of 403 orders and promises from 15 customers and companies.
CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will reach its target of 300 mandatory orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jet.
The management also assured analysts and media on Thursday that the program was on schedule.
"The test aircraft hasn't stayed on the ground longer than expected," Beaudoin said at a telephone conference, adding that during the aircraft's stand-alone, ground testing and software updates have been implemented.
Each manufacturer plant differently.
We have decided to take a first flight and then attach a revision period, which we have also done.
This happens throughout the entire flight program.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to launch in the coming weeks, the rest shortly thereafter, the company said.
However, analysts remain skeptical that 12 months after the virgin flight, the first customer can take on a CSeries aircraft.
Bombardier said it will review the plan for commissioning (EIS) and will update it in the coming months.
“The slow progress of the flight test – even if it obviously corresponds to Bombardier’s internal planning – reinforces our view that commissioning is shifting to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to <0x24>147 million or <0x24>8 cents per share of <0x24>172 million or <0x24>9 cents per share the previous year.
The adjusted gain per share is unchanged 9 cents.
Revenues declined slightly and fell from <0x24>4.2 billion to <0x24>4.1 billion.
Analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of <0x24>4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer says it delivered 45 aircraft this quarter, down from 57 last year.
Net orders dropped from 83 aircraft to 26.
Orders in the Aviation and Space Department were <0x24>32.9 billion on September 30, and thus remained unchanged from December 31.
“In the field of aviation and space, the results were within our specifications, but the low order input and overall market conditions were disappointing,” said Beaudoin.
Sales in the aerospace sector fell by 13 percent to <0x24>2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this division have risen by almost eleven percent to <0x24>2.1 billion.
The order inventory in the transport department was <0x24>32.6 billion on September 30, and was thus slightly increased compared to December 31.
The profit margin in the transport sector has been affected by settlement problems in some major contracts.
According to company management, there will be new specifications for the fourth quarter.
In the afternoon trading on Thursday, Bombardier's share fell by 8.5 percent, at <0x24>4.83, after it was also announced that Google's financial director Patrick Pichette would become the board of directors.
Brazil’s Embraer SA, the world’s third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bomber, reported a 10 percent decline in quarterly earnings on Thursday.
USA: Shots at Los Angeles Airport
An unknown man fired shots at LAX airport on Friday morning (local time).
While the airport management said via Twitter that the shooter was in custody, the Los Angeles Times reported that the man was dead.
A security guard was also killed.
The media also reported several injured.
U.S. President Barack Obama will be continuously informed about the situation, White House spokesman Jay Carney said.
Eyewitnesses said they saw a shooter with a gun in one of the flight halls, according to several media reports.
A traveler told CNN that many people had sought protection in panic.
Travelers would have been crying and children would have been crying.
There was panic among the waiters, many of them hiding behind chairs in fear.
He has heard two shots, says a traveler of the Los Angeles Times.
An employee of the TSA security agency suffered a foot injury.
The scene was “like in a movie.”
After that, he himself was taken to a security area, the man reported.
The shots are said to have fallen near a security control area.
Airport buildings evacuated
Many ambulances and police cars were driving in front of a terminal on TV screens.
Hundreds of people were brought out of the building.
Users posted photos on Twitter of a special deployment command and a gun lying on the ground.
According to the airport administration via Twitter, the incident began at 9.30 a.m. (local time).
The access roads were blocked, resulting in long-running delays, according to CNN.
Until landings, air traffic has been temporarily suspended, it said.
However, several flyers were also seen on CNN during the launch.
Terminal 3 is served mainly by smaller U.S. airlines.
Los Angeles LAX Airport is one of the largest airports in the United States.
Cocaine-dependent lawyer who warned drug boss of police investigation must go to jail
Basharat Ditta, 42, passed on information to underworld size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction might come to light
He was sentenced by Liverpool's Crown Court to three years in prison.
A well-known criminal lawyer who warned a drug baron of a major police investigation for fearing his secret drug addiction could be uncovered was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided underworld-sized Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about investigations into his drug trafficking activities after he was compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The lawyer, praised by criminals as "first-class" under the nickname "Bash", was arrested in his home in 2011 after Scarborough police oversaw him in a previous drug trial.
Officials watched Scarborough, 32, deliver three bags of cocaine to the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was with colleagues at a bar dinner.
The investigations showed that Ditta regularly consumed Class A drugs after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, wallet, and credit cards.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he attempted to unauthorizedly obtain information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by police as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people, they were later arrested after police secured <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million worth of heroin and cocaine as well as <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 in cash during a series of house searches.
Ditta, 42, forwarded information to the criminals because he feared his drug addiction could be made public.
Today, Ditta, who works for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found guilty after a three-week trial at Liverpool’s Crown Court in two counts for obstruction of justice.
He admitted possession of cocaine in an earlier interview.
The lawyer was transferred after police found out in their investigations against Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta’s house and put the drugs with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove under the lawyer’s garbage.
Shortly after delivering the drugs, Scarborough regularly telephoned Ditta, who was at dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, picked up the drugs, and then nine messages were exchanged between the two.
Ditta was known to be a “regular consumer” of cocaine after tests of Class A drugs were discovered in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but declined to take cocaine and said he had spoken to the alleged dealer because he was his client, claiming that his discussion was subject to the "law secret".
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and a hair sample was taken from him.
During the police hearing, he stated that he operates an office both under his private address and in the workplace, and clients would call him at home for legal matters.
It was announced before the court that he had summoned key drug traffickers, some of whom he had previously represented, after significant arrests and informed what the investigators knew about them.
Attorney Anne Whyte said: “A criminal law attorney should know better than anyone else that you don’t break the law.”
Ditta is accused of misusing his position as a criminal defender because he has agreed too much with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not just that of a drug dealer, but of a drug dealer who supplies his lawyer with drugs.
Part of his statements were undoubtedly legitimate, as he was the lawyer of these people.
But that went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He countered the police investigations as far as possible, so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta thus brought his professional status to the fore.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta pointed out every misbehavior of her own: “If I were a corrupt lawyer, what I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, then I would not wait 15 hours, but do it immediately.”
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said, “Mr. Ditta took the step from a criminal to a criminal at the time he began to acquire drugs from organized criminals.”
His dependence on cocaine led to hopeless compromise and made him receptive to the motives of leading members of organized crime who commissioned him to gather valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure public trust and trust.
Ditta has broken that trust and is trying to hide behind the facade of his profession.
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigations against Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three cases for possession of cocaine and a judicial disability, which underscores our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We will find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after pleading guilty to the conspiracy to traffic in heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five more people involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta published an area of questions and answers about himself, stating that his dream job is to represent lawyer clients in the death cell in America, his ultimate guest at dinner, and inequality is the motivation for his work.
The Revolutionary Work of Church Music
To conclude the celebrations on the occasion of its 160th anniversary, the Dunningen Crusade will frame two religious services with the "German Messe" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which enthralled the audience in the spring of this year, the singing clergy at the end of the jubilee year will enrich two services with the performance of the German Messe by Franz Schubert.
On Saturday, October 26, this extraordinary Mass will be heard during the evening Mass at St. Martinus Church Dunningen and on Sunday, October 27, at 10:15 p.m. at the Divine Service at St. Johannes Baptist Church in Lackendorf.
The so-called German Mass with the original title "Songs for the Celebration of the Sacred Sacrifice of Mass", D 872, is a spiritual musical work by composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of its creation.
The Mass is presented in the context of the services of God, as the client Johann Philipp Neumann meant.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the fan group of the music association Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ.
Haslach: Skepticism softens trust
With the elections to the parish council in 2015, for example, the Haslach (SE) soul care unit will change fundamentally.
There is then only one common parish council for all six parishes.
In a joint meeting on Saturday, the bodies from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
For the basic decisions of the diocese have nothing to change and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactory as possible.
Over the course of the day, it became particularly clear: the skepticism towards the new is vacillating but in terms of confidence.
From the ideas and expectations for the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council, the highly constructive discussions of the six bodies with the chief officials of the psychiatric team range.
Regional Dean Georg Schmitt explained, through a presentation, the newly drafted guidelines for psychiatric units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg.
After that, SE Haslach, as a church municipality, will form a body of public law, which enters into the rights and duties of the six individual church municipalities so far.
There will be only one common parish council and a foundation council in which the parish office is represented.
Each parish should have at least two elected members, in which six parishes are formed locally so-called congregation teams.
Its task will be in the future to promote the ecclesiastical life in the area.
The question of the finances of the individual parishes then showed a significant need for dialogue.
The novelties provide that the accumulated funds in the parishes will remain purpose-bound.
The liabilities, on the other hand, pass on to the community as a whole.
Especially with regard to the large planned investments, the commitment of which all parishes then meet, there were great concerns.
“In the past, too, only projects were invested that could be handled by individual parishes alone,” Haslach’s parish council chairman Bruno Prinzbach said.
Practical experience with a joint committee for five parishes described Barbar Knight, the chairman of the committee in the Schutterwald-Neuried psychiatric unit.
They had made the task of "become one, stay five" in 2006 and had to find that it was not so easy at all.
The organs of the Haslacher Soul Care Unit then decided to answer questions about the future composition and size of the joint parish council as well as the practical work of the community teams.
The drafting will be clarified in further sessions and will be decided at a further joint meeting of all six bodies in the coming spring.
In the end, parish councillor Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the soul care unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf, electricity becomes more expensive
The citizens of Pfullendorf must adjust to higher electricity costs.
As the managing director of the city works, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed in front of the S<0xC3><0x9C>DKURIER, a four-headed Pfullendorfer family costs between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>90 extra per year.
The main reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEG turnover from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This shift is redefined each year in October by the four operators of the major electric roads.
These determine the additional costs incurred by them from the energy transition, which they can raise by a change over the electricity price.
The urban works of Pfullendorf form the last member in this chain.
In his forecasts, the energy company’s supervisory board even assumed a higher turnover, as Jörg-Arne Bias reports.
Now the concrete figures would have to be calculated before the city works could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week.
"We're assuming an increase of 1 cent plus x," Bias said, with the number more likely to be close to 2 cents.
Lamps on permanent red: Watch for waiting time
Sometimes a lamp just doesn’t turn green.
The contact loop in the road does not respond, or the light sign is defective.
So what to do - driving in red?
If a person has waited long enough for a red light and the crossing is free, he can go on, explains Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad".
However, the waiting time must be "reasonable", which can be interpreted differently from case to case.
Becker advises to endure for at least five minutes before starting from a malfunction of the lamp.
However, whoever continues the ride despite the red lights must be clear that he is fully responsible for an accident caused by it.
If you are patient for less than five minutes, you may not wait long enough, Becker warns and refers to a ruling by the Supreme Court of Hamm.
In the negotiated case, after about three minutes of continuous redness, a driver had ignored the lights and had to take responsibility for a negligent red light violation.
The lamp was not defective, but soon turned to green.
A driving ban remained for him because of the special situation - but the fine did not.
City Council welcomes a sound budget
When it comes to budget meetings, Mayor Ralph Gerster laughs.
The municipality in Herdwangen-Schönach is well-filled and the administration has not known the debt since 2005.
In this sense, the financial year 2012 can also be counted as a full success.
This was evident in the presentation of the 2012 financial statements.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget of around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.6 million has fallen over <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1 million higher than planned.
The surplus of the administrative budget is also around one million euros above the approach, with about 1.8 million euros.
The surplus is mainly due to higher commercial tax revenues and the municipal share of income tax.
The asset budget was also clearly above the planned values.
Instead of the planned <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.5 million, it was <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.5 million last year.
"This is mainly due to the higher supply from the administrative budget," says Rothmund.
As fewer investments have been made than planned in the 2012 financial year, the return on investment has also been higher.
Overall, the overall reserve could be increased by around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.1 million to a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4.9 million now.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work.
"You don't just shake a work like this out of your sleeves," said Gerster with a view to the annual accounts.
He and the city councils were clearly pleased with the good figures.
It may sound paradoxical, but these very good figures could soon be expensive for citizens.
Due to the good financial situation, the municipality in the past was able to give up high levies.
As a result, however, according to Gerster, subsidies from the country have been cut more often.
For these grants from various countervailing positions, there are conditions.
Among other things, the cities and municipalities that apply for grants must have certain leverage rates.
“We have to look at the issue of leverage, as investments are coming in the coming years, for which we would like to have subsidies,” Gerster said in a statement.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter has been in the choir for 60 years
At 60 years of age as a singer, Hubert Wermter’s history at the men’s ensemble Cäcilia is almost twice as long as that of the autumn festival in which he was solemnly honored.
Hubert Wermter stood on stage as usual in the colors of his men’s association.
Even after 60 years, he still enjoys singing with the now more than loved choir.
Wermter was also active in the association, including as a member of the committee for 28 years.
He received several awards for his commitment and loyalty: Jörg Kohr, pastoral speaker on behalf of the Rottenburg-Stuttgart Association, handed him - since the choir is also a church choir - a certificate of the association and one of Bishop Gebhard Fürst.
His singing colleagues handed him the certificate of the German choir association as well as an engraved interest plate.
In addition to the honor, the 31st Autumn Festival took place in conventional tracks: with the MGV Betra, the vocalist Salzstetten, the singing department Baisingen and the local music association, the full margins had a colorful mix of different choirs and singing styles that entertained the around 400 visitors.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with moody songs such as "In Wine Paradise" and "Lustig, ihr Bruder".
In honor of their honorary singer Hubert Wermter, they prepared a small stand - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied".
The men's choir association Bettra also sang classical choral songs such as "Jägerwerben" by Julius Wengert, "Left, far away" by Hubert Goisern, as well as the folk song "When you pass through the valley".
With its mixed choir and its women's group - the "impulse choir" - the singer-songwriter Salzstetten provided the women's quota of the festival.
The mixed choir kidnapped Antos Gus with the Neapolitan folklore "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" in foreign countries, while the "impulse choir" also went back to foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were part of their program.
The Baisinger Sportverein's singing department returned to home fields with Hans Süssmuth and Robert Papert's "Bierlied", where the Vollmaringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical graduation.
For the children there was a small side program - "Grandma Hanne" alias Hannelore Stollsteimer performed a Kasperl theater and read a few stories that the children were busy about lunch.
Children's dreams become reality
The kindergartens and kindergartens in Zollernalbkreis receive mail on these days.
The Schwarzwald Bote, in cooperation with Bauhaus and the Zollernalb Sparkasse, wants to support the facilities in the realization of their construction and decoration wishes.
Does the kindergarten need a new sandbox?
All kindergartens, daycare centres and children’s cribs from the entire district can participate in the action.
If you have a desire to build or beautify your facility, you can apply with this Black Forest Bote.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the action kindergarten construction site.
A jury, consisting of representatives of Black Forest Bote, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, selects three wishes from all submissions.
What are the conditions for participation?
The desire should be realized with construction material worth up to 2000 euros and on a (action) day.
In addition, the winner must take care of many diligent builders himself.
What does it have to do with the day of action and the helpers?
Bauhaus provides the material with the support of the Zollernalb Sparkasse.
It will be delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and will then be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, associations and of course the educators and children themselves.
Kenyan Press Disapproves of Controversial Media Act
“We are in a frightening situation and one can ask oneself: what prevents Parliament from simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow?” was read in the newspaper, which considers the bill unconstitutional.
“The law is dramatic and very punishable and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group, which also includes CapitalFM, one of Kenya’s most reputable independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media court "will always be premeditated because it is an extended arm of the government", and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
“I hope the president will listen to us and we will appeal to him to reject this bill and send it back to Parliament,” he said.
According to The Star newspaper, the government, by means of the new law, "takes the media effectively into a burglary", but writes The Standard, Democracy and Freedom of Speech in Kenya had suffered "a severe blow" and called the draft "draconical".
The adoption of the law is part of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of the attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping mall in September.
Kenyan media drew on the anger of the authorities for publishing footage of security cameras showing the units allegedly robbing the luxurious shopping mall.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded by hiring two journalists and a leading media representative to be interviewed, even if the press briefing was withdrawn after a media outlet called.
According to the new law, media houses can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists with up to a million, as well as the risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The court also has the right to confiscate the property of the persons concerned if a fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “even a single penalty can push most radio stations into bankruptcy.”
In addition, the newspaper considers that these measures could have a devastating impact on those of Kenya's "living blogosphere".
If they keep the media silent, politicians can do whatever they want with impunity.
“No one will ever know,” Mutuma Mathiu, a nation journalist who calls the Kenyan media a decisive control factor in public life, wrote.
“If you leave politicians to themselves, they will lead the country into bankruptcy and us back in the time of hunters and collectors,” he commented.
In the past, Kenyan legislators have already brought on public trouble.
In May, they agreed to reverse the cuts ordered by the National Compensation Commission and put their current salaries back in force of about 532,000 schillings tax-free per month – they are among the highest in the world.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream come true for FC
The importance for the city and the football club was not affected by the official opening ceremony for the artificial grass sports ground despite the cold weather and the rain.
Last Saturday, everyone had wished for a more pleasant celebration, but Peter did not want to participate in it.
So all those who came without a umbrella could not hold one for any reason.
This went to the musicians who framed the party, as did some speakers.
Wet also became FC chairman Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream.
His thanks went to Mayor Walter Klumpp, who was very committed to the implementation of the project, to the municipal council, the companies involved and the members of the association who participated.
Here in particular Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The rugged pensioners moved 400 square meters of plasterstones for the new roads.
This remarkable voluntary commitment was also honoured by Landtagsabgeordneter Karl Rombach.
Other greetings were for the city sports committee Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the South Baden football association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the planning office, who announced a donation for the youth department of the club.
Mayor Klumpp reminded that the repeated weather-related influences in the spring and autumn added to the original lawn in such a way that it could not be played.
Already 15 years ago, there were the first thoughts on solving the problem, when it was thought about the construction of a third place on the grounds of the football club or at the real school at Lake Salinen.
Both were rejected again.
Six years ago, ideas came about setting up an artificial grass sports ground, which was generally considered the ultimate solution.
Concrete plans were made two years ago when the FC took over the Schabelstube in Erbepacht, promised a cost contribution of 100,000 euros for the construction of the square and the country approved funding of 104,000 euros.
In October 2012, the municipal council decided to take over the remaining <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>356,000 at the total cost of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>560,000, summarized Klumpp.
The construction of the 68-metre 108-metre Kunstrasenplatz took place on 4 June.
During the three-month construction phase, 3000 cubic meters of land were removed, half of which was used for the construction of a dirt bike track.
Union and SPD have continued their coalition negotiations on internal and judiciary issues.
This is what the responsible working group met in Berlin this morning.
Among other things, it involves direct democracy, the conquest of deputies and the federal police.
In the morning, the Working Group on Migration and Integration wanted to continue its discussions.
This should involve, among other things, dual citizenship, where both sides have opposing views.
The SPD wants to end the compulsion for immigrant children born in Germany to choose one - the Union rejects a double passport.
In the case of traffic, which is not on the agenda on Friday, the SPD supported its "no" to a car fee requested by the CSU.
A vignette is a "flat rate for multi-driving and thus ecologically counterproductive", Florian Pronold, SPD negotiating director for transport, said in a letter to his group.
There was a threat of avoidance of traffic on roads, which are already major accident points.
The introduction of a tailgate for all cars would also be a first step from Pronolds’ point of view.
"There is a risk that compensation for Germans will be cancelled at a later date," he said.
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart: The Singing Furnace on the Outdoor Stage
Stuttgart - "When will it be summer again?" was not really the question on Friday night at the Killesberg outdoor stage.
It was a tropical night in Stuttgart.
The best conditions for Schlagerstar Dieter Thomas Kuhn and his band.

Driver seriously injured in accident
A 37-year-old driver from Aachen was seriously injured in an accident on Thursday night.
According to police, a 41-year-old girl from Müsch was driving her car on the Kempen Outer Ring towards Grefrath around 9:15 p.m.
When she wanted to turn to the left on St. Töniser Straße, she oversaw the 37-year-old’s coming car.
The carriages collided.
The Aachener suffered severe injuries and had to be taken to the hospital for treatment.
Constance: Lockdown after accident on the schänzlekreisel
According to police, the accident occurred when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss Seat Ibiza on Thursday evening, around 8 p.m., on the left lane of the two-track Reichenaustraße, drove out of the city.
Shortly before the traffic at the Schänzle, he noticed that he was on the left sabbies track towards Stromeyersdorfstraße and switched to the right track.
This led to a collision with the BMW of a 23-year-old constable driving there.
The 19-year-old’s VW Passat driving behind the BMW was also damaged.
A total of about 15,000 damages occurred, the police said.
The road had to be blocked during the accident, he said.
Vienna Airport to create Passenger Calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
Saying such things will no longer exist at Vienna-Schwechat Airport in the future.
Most of the loudspeakers fall away as a result - the noise level is supposed to be so sharply reduced.
Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation.
As airport spokesman Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Wien, Vienna Airport follows an international trend with the closure of passages relating to individuals.
For example, airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai are already abandoning the noisy calls.
Due to the omission of these statements – on average, about 200 personal calls are made in a day by the speakers – it is expected to go quieter at the airport in the future.
"It has also been shown in experience that these individual passages have been relatively little perceived, but at the same time all other information about altered flight ascents or departure times is slightly undermining here," Kleemann said in a conversation with the radio station.
Highlander Games on the Coldenhof
In addition to the braking carriage with tractors, there will be a second competition at the agricultural autumn festival at the Kaltenhof from 6 to 8 September.
On Saturday, September 7, the Highlander Games will start at 13:30.
Although they have a Scottish tradition, they are swabishly raised on the Kaltenhof.
Teams and individual fighters measure themselves in the disciplines of tree stem throws, stem throws and water smears.
The tree trunk is four and a half meters long and weighs 25 to 30 kilograms.
"It's not about the breadth," organizer Peter Saile explains.
The stem has to be discarded vertically, to overlap once and then just come to the bed.
This is assessed with the most points.
When it comes to shoveling, it comes to target accuracy.
Eight meters away is thrown on a pile.
Skills and strength must be demonstrated by the participants when carrying water more than 50 meters.
The amount of time and water in a bottich is measured at the end.
From each "Clan" or team, then two are allowed to participate in the individual competition.
The winners of the team and individual competition will receive prizes.
Training can be done from 10 a.m.
Suitable clothing is desirable, for example, the competitors can compete in the Scottish skirt.
Swabian dressing is also allowed.
For "Outfit", the jury awards a few more bonus points.
You can register up to one hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish-Swedish Highlander Games and the tractor pulling, which starts half an hour earlier, a lot of action is already on the festival ground on Saturday.
In the evening, the blast music friends come at their expense.
At 7:00 p.m., the Birabohmian blasmusic from Schömberg shapes the great entertainment evening.
The chapel plays floating polkas and marches.
But their repertoire also includes sensitive rollers and a satirical big band sound.
Heinz Koch, known as the singer host and Black Wurst Baron, will be among the runners.
In Dornhan, he appeared at the Christmas market and at the Narrenzunft.
On Sundays, the music association Leinstetten hosts breakfast, from 2 p.m. Böffingen’s peasant chapel is a guest, and the “Oldies” then make the party go out.
On Friday, the stoppelacker party with DJ Ralf starts.
Other programme points include the Oldtimer and Tractor Meeting on Saturday and Sunday, exhibitions by companies on the topic of agriculture and forestry.
Other attractions on Sunday are the maize labyrinth, the crafts market and the sheepsharing.
Specially for children there is a stroller zoo, stroller hippburg, tractor rides (under guidance) and tractor surfing.
The organizers are the multipurpose hall, the ski club and the tractor friends "Zündkäpsele".
Milk and egg alternatives at a glance
Vegan diet requires plant alternatives to eggs, milk and dairy products.
Purified tofu with plant seeds is, for example, a quark substitute.
The Association of Vegetarians calls it World Vegetarian Day on November 1.
On the occasion of World Vegetarian Day on 1 November, the German Vegetarian Federation proposes a number of vegan alternatives:
Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter, yogurt is replaced by soy yogurt.
Instead of milk, soy, oats, almonds or rice milk can be used.
Retractable plant seedlings replace conventional seedlings.
There are also plant alternatives to eggs.
For example, a half-brown, ripe banana can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
Also 50 grams of apple mushrooms or one tablespoon of ground flaxseed plus three tablespoons of water are suitable for this.
For example, a mixture of one teaspoon of baking powder, one teaspoon of food strength and three teaspoons of mineral water are looser instead of eggs.
But also 50 grams of soy yogurt or silk tofu can fulfill this purpose.
According to Vebu, around 800,000 people in Germany are currently eating vegan, that is, purely plant-based.
Sleeping in New York
On the way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, Black Forest High School students met the American city of New York.
After eight hours of flight, it went straight to the Brooklyn Bridge, through which the heart of the city, Manhattan, was reached on foot.
A fascinating view of the world-famous skyline was already offered here, which in the evening light is a special stimulus.
Due to the time shift, the students were on their feet for almost 24 hours, but faithful to the motto "The City Doesn't Sleep" was decided on the day at Times Square.
Despite shutdown, on the second day, the Statue of Liberty could be reached by ferry and climbed on foot.
Then it passed through the financial center around Wall Street as a memorial on September 11.
On the third day, students were able to get an overview of the fascinating large city from the 373-metre-high viewing platform of the Empire State Building.
Afterwards, it went through the hectic drive of New York’s streets over the Rockefeller Center to Central Park, which offered an ideal opportunity for short stays in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have now arrived in their host families and experience the school day at Weymouth High School.
Also this year, a Hubertus Mass will be celebrated on St. Hubertus’s Name Day in the parish church of St. Marien on Hülsbergstraße.
St. Hubertus was a fairly ruthless hunter who was converted by a vision and was later appointed Bishop of Lüttich.
The hunting horn blower group of the Westphalian Hunters under the direction of Brigitte Kluth plays on parforce horn (natural horn in the mood Es) according to old, original French melodies.
The blowers wear equestrian clothing because they mainly accompany riders, horses and dogmen musically on trailing hunts.
The solemn fair will take place on Sunday, November 3rd, at 11.30 a.m.
The newly designed shelf shines with a new cafe.
One that invites you to stay and come back.
One that wants to make the name the program.
According to the lexicon, Déjà Vu is a psychological phenomenon that manifests itself in the feeling of having experienced or seen a new situation before.
In the case of visiting the café of the same name at the stop in the district town of Kleve in view to the Rhine-Wal University, it does not have to remain with the pure Déjà Vu feeling.
After all, the cafe with the beautiful name has exactly that goal: not only to make an actual stay thoughtful, but hand-fixed and repeated.
Because it's just fun and it's just beautiful.
A glance into the inner life of the bumper 8 gives the viewer a good feeling on arrival.
The state-of-the-art but not cool cafe atmosphere looks like a place to feel comfortable.
Here, the team with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top will spoil the guest with a variety of coffee or cocktail variants.
To do this, there are delicious cakes or individually prepared fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, have already made a name for themselves as gastronomists before the opening of the jewelry café at the store: in Kranenburg they conducted the "Art Lounge".
From moving to Kleve at the stop, the sympathetic cafe lovers expect more audiences.
Last but not least, by college.
“We don’t have a specific target group,” said Daniel Büttner.
Rather, the two young students here want to address the same as seniors and all age groups in between.
About coffee-lovers.
The sympathetic couple of owners is behind the coffee genius.
Enjoys the scented hot browsing in a variety of variations even.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is more of an expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stell is the cappuccino drinker.
"A baguette - that's my thing," she told the NRZ.
There were two events in the light cafe.
Better to say one.
Because the harbour festival was more likely to take place outside - the Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the ringing night.
"Beautiful, successful and funny," the two 33-year-olds found.
But it's not everyone's business.
Perhaps that’s why Daniel Büttner is not a big fan of Event Evenings: “You can’t do it all right.”
And with an event, I always talk to only those who are interested in the special event.
Events will be the exception with us.
"We want to disrupt the very normal operation as little as possible".
It should be said that Já Vu also stands for reliability.
Regarding the quality of the products offered here, as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at the stop in Kleve.
The road that is becoming more and more a gastronomic area.
To the delight of many glues, the guests from near and far, and the students who discover the gastromeile and thus also the Café Déjà Vu for themselves.

A Day of Thanksgiving at the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th foundation festival to which the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" had invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, were happy to come.
In the meeting room of the guest house "Witteborg" in Dinker all enjoyed the harmonious co-operation entirely in the sign of music.
Traditionally, the foundation festival is also always the appropriate festivity to perform honors.
This time, writer Rolf Wagener was delighted with the special award “Songwriter of the Year”.
"You have not only written a lot for us, but you have also done so many rounds for us, our heartfelt thanks for that," said the Choir Chairman Erich Slotmann.
The awards for participating in the performances and choir samples by means of activity streaks went to the choir leader Dieter Schulze this year with 44 entries, followed by the honorary chairman Horst Pier-Ribbert, the chairman himself, and the last year's "songwriter of the year" taking part with the "Winrichler" of the year.
The fifth place was occupied by Notenwart Artur Brücker.
A special thanks was given by the board to the team of teammate Ange Pier-Ribbert, who had once again enchanted an extra-class menu, and to Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" meets at the club premises every Tuesday at 19.45.
"New songs are welcome to us at any time," says Schlotmann.
UN announces new targets in the fight against poverty
The United Nations is starting to develop a series of new targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals announced twelve years ago to combat poverty.
On the eve of the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for “sustainable development goals” to replace the 2015 Millennium Development Goals.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world political leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the summit that the time had come to “think beyond national interests”.
“I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch a process with which universal, sustainable development goals should be agreed,” he said.
“These targets will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will not hesitate to implement this mandate given to me by the Member States in order to realize our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals, which are based on the success of the Millennium Development Goals."
Although the SG Achim/Baden has been without a win for four days, there is still a good mood in the top handball league.
Trainer Tomasz Malmon has no doubt about this.
Everyone is fully motivated on the matter.
But I hope we can finally win again.
"Because I don't know what a victory like that tastes like," Malmon expects a successful experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even though Fredenbeck’s third-league reserve has not yet cut out trees, Malmon warned ahead of time.
I have trained many players in my A-Youth.
Therefore, they will certainly be especially motivated against their ex-coach.
"In addition, it has to be expected that there will be reinforcement from the first one," explains the SG-Coach.
In order to finally return to the track of success, the Malmon team must definitely increase in comparison to past appearances.
Above all things in the cover work and in the switching game, it last but not least was huge.
Opportunities must also be improved.
That’s why I hope my players finally got their heads off during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique grow due to clashes between influential figures
Thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo under the watchful eye of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder of Mozambique and the first president of Mozambique, to vote for peace in a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace again, we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment company.
For fear of the future of the country, she exchanged her business clothes against a T-shirt with the inscription “We demand security” in Portuguese and on Thursday joined the crowd on the capital’s Independence Square.
For two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, which are among the worst fighting since the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, initially supported by white-run Rhodesia and later by the apartheid government of South Africa in an effort to destabilize the country's independent government.
Following the 1992 peace treaty, she became an opposition party.
Analysts believe it is unlikely that the country will fall back into a growing conflict, but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals.
The fast-growing economy is at stake because the discovery of huge gas deposits off the coast and coal deposits in the northwest could bring more than <0x24>50 billion in investments from companies like Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the US to the country in the coming years.
The ruling Freelimo party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in Sofala province, a traditional high fortress of Renamos, on October 17.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated as government forces attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group’s leader, Renamos spokesman told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to ease concerns about instability.
Speaking to AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama sees himself as a “loser” who “will use all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government.”
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid a war.
However, concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted with the words, Renamo giving up the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that Frelimo no longer respects the agreement.
“Our vision is to resume negotiations seriously,” Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have contributed little to alleviating the tensions fueled by a series of clashes this year.
“We have two adult men here (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who collided with their heads,” says Joseph Hanlon, a professor at Open University and Mozambique experts.
None of them are good at negotiating and no one is willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which is pushing for electoral reforms, has already declared that she will boycott the municipal elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt by a disturbing movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamo’s election success has been shrinking since 1992, while a newer party, founded by a former member of the Movimento Democrático de Mozambique (MDM), is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation is due when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country’s democracy.
“He doesn’t want multi-party democracy, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to give up presidential office,” Mazanga said.
It is unclear what capacities Renamo has, but she has undertaken unrestful attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important north-south connection.
Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo, where Beira is located, the port, mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale to export coal.
In June, Rio stopped using the railway for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the route.
Mazanga responded reluctantly to the question of whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique,” Mazanga said.
The instability has increased the frustration over the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, as many people have already been worried about corruption, dragging progress in development and a recent wave of kidnapping.
“People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems,” he said.
Omar Sultane, a protester, said people just wanted stability.
“Nobody cares about Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and usable roads again,” he said.
Children should be taught myths and legends as “models for life,” according to one author.
Thor’s stories showed that “brutal force has no chance against clever tricks,” and the Artus legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream.
Many of the myths, however, are “too wild, too insulting, and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools,” which is why Crossley-Holland advocated a “careful selection” of age-appropriate works.
“I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I have proposed this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that among authors and teachers who are "overly didactic" children would be "completely shut down" because in entertaining stories the messages would be "submerged".
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, explained: “You can pursue certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background as much as possible.”
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an author who writes for children is the need to convey hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to the happy end, but there is an immanent sense of good and evil.
This must be submerged, revealed through history and not explained.
This is the old story of showing rather than telling.
Hansjakob moves again in Freihof
100 years ago, Heinrich Hansjakob took his retirement seat in Haslach, and on Sunday his last years were living in the "Freihof".
Many spectators were thrilled by the extremely brief stage game.
From the arrival of the award of honorary citizenship to his death, screenwriter and Hansak actor Alois Kraftzcyk had designed an entertaining piece, which received a lot of applause under the direction of Cornelia Volk.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker through the ten different scenes, explained connections and bridged time leaps from youth to near retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hansjakob returns home to his children’s heaven, to his open yard.
And then the stage play began, in which Alois Krafczyk once more shined in his parade role as the great son of the city.
Stylishly he drove with the "Black Forest Fuchsen" by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach.
Not only was he received with a lot of applause from the audience, his sister Philippines welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann understood incredibly well to take on the role of the sister and gave her immense life in mimic and gesture.
Between the individual playing scenes, the Mühlenbacher Farmer’s Chapel played appropriately selected pieces of music and thus rounded off the performance.
Heinz Winkler, the mayor of Haslach, was given the honour to be honoured, who, together with a part of the city council, made his maintenance in the name of the then official Hättich.
Their upkeep was then made by the three-king singers, who prompted Hansjakab to shout: "How beautiful it is, then youthful memories of my own three-king period will come alive again."
With their song "O Jesulein", they delighted the audience in the open yard as well as the Storchentagkinder with their loud "Herau, Herau".
His criticism of the official church at the time had expressed the same concerns as his concerns about the outbreaks in agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of the war.
In the homeland, behind his tomb chapel on fire at Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
"A restless spirit had finally found his peace and had gone home forever," he said at the end of the play.
There were many applause and many praise words from the audience for the performance.
Basketball: The hope of Neckar Giants grows
The odds of remaining in the league of the sporty Ludwigsburger Bundesliga basketballers have increased.
If there is a wildcard procedure, then there is now less competitor for the Neckar giants.
The Hamburg Towers Basketball project is waived from applying for a possible back-to-back position.
"We will not participate in the wildcard process," said former national player Pascal Roller, who has been setting up the concept for a professional club in Hanseatic City since 2012.
However, a first breath from Ludwigsburg could not be understood.
“We did not deal with the wildcard procedure, as long as it is not clear that Düsseldorf does not get a license,” said Neckar-Riesen boss Alexander Reil of our newspaper.
Until 23 May, the Düsseldorf Baskets can still submit documents to the arbitral tribunal and prove his economic timing of the Bundesliga.
So far, the Rhinelands have been denied the license twice.
The arbitral tribunal is the last instance.
Haigerloch: Abendmahlskirche gets to the point of view
As a contribution to the city’s 150th anniversary of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the city’s Office of Culture and Tourism dedicates the last of its this year’s public theme tours on Sunday, October 27, to the evening church.
After the visit of the Atomic Keller Museum, the Haigerhole period should be considered after 1850, when Haigerhole came under Prussian rule.
The crowning end point is a visit to the evening meal church.
There, the guides will tell the story of the building of the church and gain insights into the development of the evangelical community in a Catholic area.
Last but not least, in the church is also the view of the evening paintings created by Friedrich Schuz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter.
It is an original faithful reproduction of the famous Milanese model by Leonardo da Vinci.
Meeting point to the second half-hour guided tour is at 3 p.m. at the Atom Keller Museum.
Cards are available at the nuclear cellar museum.
For questions and information, the tourist office of the city of Haigerloch is available.
Snowden could also say in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in the U.S. court case in his Russian asylum.
Representatives of the Federal Prosecutor’s Office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia.
This was reported by Interfax, citing unnamed circles familiar with the situation.
Such a question could be clarified interstately, he said.
A departure of Snowden from Russia is virtually excluded.
"In this case, he will lose his refugee status," the agency quoted its source as saying.
Because Germany is an ally of the United States, Snowden threatened the extradition there, he said.
Long Breath Gets Paid
Six men's teams fought in the league's tennis tournament for the title.
In the end, the endurance of the team Maier/Bronner decided the last match.
A dream weather had received the tennis department of the sports friends Rohrdorf for the tournament of local clubs and friends.
The fun of playing tennis was at the forefront of the tournament.
There were five games per team on the plan, each playing against each.
Played in double mode with a long set of up to nine points or a maximum duration of 45 minutes.
Anja Schlichter leads the tournament
The tournament management was in the hands of Anja Schlichter, supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with pasta, the tournament went into the decisive phase.
The favourites Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner were point-by-point with Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic (both teams of SG Rohrweiler), so the last two matches had to make the decision.
Carmen Müller was finally able to pass the Walking Cup to Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the goal line.
The second place was double Michael Klippel/Sadmin Osmicic.
Rainer and Bernd Maier of the Asphalt-richer team reached the Bronze Triangle.
During the late afternoon sun and coffee and cakes, the tournament was successful.
On the last weekend of August, the Schwarzwald Freilichtmuseum Vogtsfarmhof in Gutach near Hornberg is again firmly in children’s hands.
Traditionally, the museum welcomes visitors on Saturdays and Sundays, 24 and 25 August, as part of the summer holiday program, to a colorful children’s and family party with numerous participations and events.
"Big and small can learn different old crafts on two days," it says in the press release.
Whether making soap, turning candles, filing or making ropes, for any age the right thing is there.
Regional craftsmen help the children from 11am to 5pm.
The museum workshop is also being worked on.
When building cockroaches, water bikes or circles, the young guests can demonstrate their craftsmanship.
A lot of fun also promises the many old games, such as push-cart racing or sled runs.
Speed and coordination are required here.
For all small detectives, the open-air museum offers a puzzle tour through the museum on Saturday and Sunday, at 12:00 and 2:00 p.m. each.
On a walkway, the children must guess which stories correspond to the truth or are still lying.
In addition, visitors will have the special opportunity to get to know the open-air museum during a walk with black forest foxes.
Not only horses, but also many other animals such as sheep, goats, cows and chickens are to be found and admired on the site.
In addition, on Sunday, all children can enjoy the Clown Otsch, who runs his snack with the museum guests from 11 a.m.
Meanwhile, Hermann Büttner is a cozy and fairy tale.
The storyteller takes the little guests to the wonderful world of fairy tales at 11, 13 and 15.
In addition, the children’s dance group from Gutach will perform traditional dances at 11.30 a.m.
In addition, on both days of the event from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., numerous craftsmen such as the Besenbinder, the Neighbor, the Spinner, the Weber and the Baker can be seen over the shoulders in their traditional work.
Even before the end of the summer holidays in Baden-Württemberg, visitors to the open-air museum await a varied holiday program.
In a small New Zealand town, Burt Muro is considered a worthy Caucasian for taking part in a race in America with his motorcycle, built in 1920.
In spite of a heart defect, Burt is not to be taken away from his dream.
With his savings, a few donations and a mortgage on his old workshop shelves, he transfers to Los Angeles by ship.
After the film, there is coffee, tea and cake.
Schrilles Piepsen disturbs residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily in land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the harbour.
The company has several irons on site in the fire.
In addition to coal imports, Rhenus Midgard invests in wind turbine logistics, among others.
Black shimmers the coal on the warehouse in front of the dam.
Two huge blue halides and rechargers distribute or discharge the coal here as needed.
With each movement of the sweepstakes, a loud warning sound sounds across the ground.
"The signals are for security purposes and are required by law," says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, in the case of unfavorable winds, this is widely heard - and there have already been some complaints from people from the city council.
He takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore taken contact with the affected people, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, it is now possible to keep the warning signals with technical measures quieter.
In the future, he will also focus on the open dialogue with the neighbours.
Matthias Schrell has a lot of things ahead of the scene.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on coal imports for power plants and is one of the largest in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the 18.5 meters deepening stove in front of the terminal, Capesize-Bulkcarrier can also be manufactured here for a long time.
“This year we want to crack the 3 million-ton mark at the envelope,” Schrell said.
In addition to the on-site Eon power plant, the imported coal goes to power plants in the countryside.
If the GDF-Suez power plant is still connected, 5 million tons of coal imports per year will be realistic.
The three ship loaders on the bridge as well as the second conveyor belt could create up to 10 million.
Bayern basketballer optimistic despite first defeat
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not stifle the huge optimism among the basketball players of FC Bayern Munich.
"No one can prevent us from believing to win even against the best team in Europe in the last two years," Bayern coach Svetislav Pesic balanced after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday night with title defender Olympiakos Piraeus.
We have sent the message: Basketball exists in Munich too!
At their first third appearance in the European royal class, the Munichers sold themselves very well for a long time, but were simply not clear enough in the crucial phases.
The guests first managed to turn the artwork, a 15-point stand 13 minutes before the end into a guided tour, before Piraeus gave the game a turn again.
"We've been incredibly fighting back against the two-time Euroleague champion, but then again made slight mistakes," Bayern pro Yassin Idbihi said.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful pitchers of the Munichers, who in the first two matches had marked victories against Italian series champion Montepaschi Siena and Polish title-holder Zielona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten Years New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: almost a century ago, variety artist Frank Fay, who worked as a lecturer at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, started telling the crowd directly jokes in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fays Innovation has been expanding, as recently at the New York Comedy Festival.
Established and led by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the Stand-up Institution Carolinas, this year the festival celebrates its 10th anniversary with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
“Most of these headlines started at Carolinas and then became more and more successful until they were too familiar to perform at a club,” Hirsch said.
We have designed this festival so that we can continue to work with them.
This year’s event features performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher as well as “Stand Up for Heroes”, an annual music and comedy charity event for army veterans at Madison Square Garden, including Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, and Rogers Water.
With the festival, the world of comedy has also grown.
A number of the comedians attending the festival this year have become known through rather unconventional ways, such as broadcasts on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll was known for a sitcom on cable television (the ironically-slip fantasy football series "The League" on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the band's "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation", although she is best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, race-focused W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest visitor magnets of the festival is an interview: David Steinberg talks to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but has become a respected television and film director as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007 he moderated a television show entitled "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" at TV Land.
The meeting takes place at the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
“The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry’s entire work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that when he's here, he sometimes walks through the streets between two buildings and thinks, "Hey, if I lose all my money, then maybe I live here."
Iran Satisfied with Nuclear Negotiations Process
A week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN veto powers, Iran and Germany are satisfied with the negotiating process.
“After years, we now have an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency to address the differences in recent years,” Foreign Minister Mohammed Dschawad Sarif wrote on his Facebook page.
Although it would be a long way to go, the nuclear dealer is satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that both sides will eventually come to a solution.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys kill game camcorders with machete
Two children have confessed to the murder of an 11-year-old in Uruguay.
The two 14- and 12-year-old boys had invited their victim to go bird hunting with them.
Armed with machetes and knives, they hit the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the body into a well, the newspaper "El País" reported on Thursday.
Afterwards, they would have played football in front of their apartments in a working-class neighborhood.
The body was found the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometers north of the exclusive beach resort of Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five-year-old half-sister of the teenage girl who had taken her with her said she had been sexually assaulted by the boy.
However, when the girl described the tathering before the police without mentioning an attack on her, the two boys admitted the 11-year-old's intentional killing.
As a reason, the elder called, among other things, a rivalry in football.
He was temporarily admitted to a psychiatric youth facility.
Contributors must go to jail
The county court has sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three-and-a-half years in prison for exploiting human trafficking, supply, threat, insult, and dangerous bodily injury.
The former Federal Army soldier, who worked as a doorkeeper after two operations in Afghanistan, made a confession in a trial speech.
According to him, he met women in five cases via internet or telephone contacts, which he sent to the police after a few weeks against their will.
He continued to resist with violence and threats.
He retained the income of the women who had been earning for him for many years.
By confiscating phones and SIM cards, he made contacts of women with the outside world.
Together with a colleague who mediated the women, he brought them to various brothels in the southwest.
There he let them partly monitor her to control her income.
In court, the defendant initially claimed that he was suffering from severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan were killed next to him in an explosion.
After a psychiatrist had large doubts about the psychological limitation and thus a limited culpability, the 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession.
The court no longer needed to understand the injured women.
According to a Kripo official, at least four additional cases of human trafficking were detected by phone surveillance after a first ad.
The interviews were marked by a high level of aggression.
In later hearings, the injured would have confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness, in which one of the women had discovered blue spots all over the body, has not made a statement to date.
It is a “completely broken personality” that violence and exploitation in this profession are considered normal.
The defendant regretted his behavior yesterday.
“He has broken out from these circles and wants to lead a normal life after his arrest,” he said.
Oil price continues to rise to 96 USD per barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday after concerns about high supply overestimated a report that China’s energy-hungry manufacturing sector is growing.
The reference oil pipeline for deliveries in December fell by 14 cents to <0x24>96.24 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange in late morning in Europe.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, a price drop of 5.8 percent in October.
The large range of crude oil has taxed prices in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said on Wednesday that the U.S. supply increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over the course of five weeks, the supply had increased by 25 million barrels.
But on Friday, there were indications of stronger demand by two reports of increased activity in Chinese manufacturing.
This indicates a continued recovery of China’s economy, which grew to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after it reached its lowest level in two decades in the previous quarter.
Brent crude oil, a benchmark for international crude oil also used by U.S. refineries, fell by 26 cents to <0x24>108.58 per barrel at the ICE Exchange in London.
Court blocks decision on NYPD’s Stop-and-Frisk Directive
A U.S. Federal Appeal Court blocked a judge's order on Thursday that had requested changes to the New York Police Department's stop-and-run program, and disbanded the judge from the case.
The 2nd U.S. Court of Appeal stated that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended until an appeal to the city was decided.
In August, the judge ruled that the city violated the constitution in the way the program was implemented to arrest and interrogate people.
The city appealed against its assessment and ordered remedial measures, including the decision to set up a supervisory authority to assist the police in amending its directive and the corresponding training programme.
The appellate court heard the arguments for the requested suspension on Tuesday.
The appeals report stated that the judge had to be disqualified from the case because she violated the U.S. Code of Conduct for Judges by stipulating that a judge should avoid the appearance of partisanship; this was partly done with a series of media interviews, and she responded to the public statements.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they inappropriately targeted black and Latin American men with the Stop-and-Frisk program.
She appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of major changes, including policy reforms, training and service supervision, and ordered a pilot programme with body-bearing cameras in neighborhoods where most controls were carried out.
In August, the city of New York declared itself ready to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were released after a police check back.
An oral hearing on the appointment of the city is scheduled after March 14, 2014.
The Stop-and-Frisk tactic has been criticized by a number of civil rights defenders.
Controls of this type have been available in various forms for decades, but the number of recorded controls during the term of the partyless mayor Michael Bloomberg rose to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men, who belonged to all minorities, filed a lawsuit that evolved into a collective lawsuit.
Proponents of changes to the NYPD’s Stop-and-Frisk program say the changes will end unfair practices and create a more reliable and effective police and affect the way other police presidencies use the regulation.
They are opposed to the view that the changes would mitigate the morale of the police, but not the criminality; they would also waste money and not solve the wider problem of a police, which is under pressure after the disappearance of thousands of positions in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that she did not end the Stop-and-Frisk practice, which is constitutional, but only reforms the way the NYPD implements the controls.
From the luck of the dreaming camels
Happiness is an oasis that only dream camels manage to reach
With this Bedouin wisdom, the first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association "Helping Hands".
On Saturday afternoon, the association’s tenth birthday was celebrated, which can already have significant successes.
The first chairman, Henne, reported in detail on the work of the association.
He himself was first in Mauritania in 2004 at Cheijk-Zayed Hospital in Nouakchott.
As a result, a further cooperation developed, and the gynecologist Henne performed numerous operations on several trips on the site.
During the speeches, images of the interventions were shown on a large canvas, so that the guests of the anniversary event could take a picture of the aforementioned actions.
The club's desert vehicle was also shown.
It is a former Federal Border Guard Vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had made the proposal to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and is now planning to work as a consultant at the association, according to Henne.
In 2008, the Zimmerei Schleeh from Baiersbronn created the hospital in Socogim, a poor neighborhood on the outskirts of the capital, in the record time of almost a week - voluntarily.
Henne also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Particularly interesting in times when the birth clinic in Nagold is to be nationalized.
You learn a lot in Africa as a doctor, says Henne, for example, de-escalation against burn-out.
Due to the political unrest in the country, it was not possible to make as many trips as planned, but for this many doctors came to Germany to hospitalize here in different areas.
In addition, containers with material are regularly sent to Africa, so in March of this year medical devices, medicines, banding materials, hospital beds and glasses.
Mitinitiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself provided plenty of local colour by telling about Mercedes cars rebuilt from Mauritania to the mobile goat stand and describing the experiences of the Stammheim musicians who traditionally support the association on their Mauritanian journey.
As his personal motives, he called his work in the field of accounting as a young deputy.
When it became clear to him how much money was lost on the road, he decided to help Africans control a budget by the people.
In addition, Moftel stressed that the global economy also demands global human love.
It should also be noted that Africa is closer than some think.
It is not far from Gran Canaria to Africa.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a tip
Former News of the Word publisher Andy Coulson allegedly used “telephone hacking, monitoring, and confrontation” in an attempt to confirm a false tip about a case of then-Inner Minister Charles Clarke.
Attorney Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey court in May 2005 News of the World had heard a false rumor that Clarke had a relationship with his "attractive special adviser" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper commissioned private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby's voicemails, and followed them, but Coulson also called them and left messages as the court learned.
“In the opinion of the prosecutor’s office, Coulson, who is now the publisher of the NotW, is not someone standing in front of people’s apartment hoping to catch them on fresh action, but someone who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction,” said Edis.
He said NotW used three methods to investigate stories investigatively: phone hacking, monitoring, and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows of the second, the surveillance, otherwise it can't be.
What does the first look like?
Does he know about phone hacking?
He argues about it, but we say, "And if he knew about it."
Rumors about a Clarke affair were first picked up by NotW’s feature editor when a source who was sexually interested in Pawlby was told, “Don’t waste your time, she’s with Charles.”
A band with voicemails from their phone of at least three occasions was secured in August 2006 in Mulcaires apartment.
The investigators also found records on the detective’s computer, where Pawlby and her sister were stored as “projects”.
At the time of the investigation, Pawlby’s grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about them, Edis explained.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw the monitoring of the movements of Pawlby.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content: "I have a story we want to release tomorrow that I would like to talk to Charles about."
Edis explained that Coulson’s activities in this story followed the same pattern as with other important personalities, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jurors heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett had faced an affair with a married woman when he himself was in a relationship with co-accused Rebekah Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks argue that they have sworn to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted the phone hacking.
As a result of protests against the planned Reichssteuern, the French football will in fact carry out the first strike since 1972.
A simplification meeting ends without results.
In the conflict over wealth taxes, the government and professional football in France maneuvered into a corner after a failed settlement meeting.
President François Hollande received representatives of associations and associations at the Élysée Palace in Paris on Thursday and heard their complaints.
However, he refused to save football from the planned 75 percent tax on income of more than one million euros per year, which all companies in the country are expected to pay for two years from 2014.
The other side also remained hard.
The strike announced at the end of November will also be carried out, the head of the Association of Professional Clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel, said.
The game days set between November 29 and December 2 in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 are thus out.
Gechingen: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the residents in planning early," Mayor Jens Häußler opened the Citizens Information Event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Approximately 80 participants had come to the town hall to explain the planned actions, to ask questions, to express concerns and to bring ideas.
Hößler made it clear: "The final decisions fall to the members of the council".
The floodwaters, which hit Gechingen on May 15, 2009, unprepared, had been a cutting-edge event that raised the question of protection for the future, Häußler said.
A river area survey was commissioned with the neighbouring municipality of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
“The protection of as many built plots as possible is the goal,” Häußler said.
Based on the planning of the protection in front of a German weather service statistically every 100 years to be expected floods.
Climate change is accounted for by a 15% surcharge.
In specialist circles, this is referred to as "HQ 100aKlima".
The water masses that caused significant damage in Gechingen in 2009 corresponded to a 1,000-year-old flood.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement," Häußler said.
In order to achieve the protection of HQ 100aKlima, around four million euros must be invested in gechingen, with the municipality able to expect state grants of around 70 percent.
Häußler pointed out, however, that there will only be support if an overall concept is implemented.
To this end, the community relies on the participation of the citizens.
An elaborate planning and approval procedure must be completed.
At best, 2016 can be started with implementation.
Among other things, the protection concept, which was presented already last week in the municipal council (we reported) provides for local measures in the flow of the river Irm from the Stammheim Valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took the opportunity to raise their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why no more dams and reservoirs were planned to protect the site.
Gregor Kühn, expert planner of the commissioned engineering office Wald and Corbe from Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, stressed that the interplay of all the measures presented is necessary to achieve the desired goal in the sum.
In addition, the most economical solution was found, according to Joachim Wald von Wald und Corbe.
Unrest prevailed in the caretakers of the altar, who, even in the case of normal thunderstorms, suffered from overloading of the canal network.
The problem is known in the administration and first measures have already been taken.
Häussler pointed out, however, that the guidelines for channel systems are different than for flood protection and should not be mixed.
The municipality is obliged to interpret the channel network in such a way that two to three-year regeneration events could be exacerbated.
Dimensioning the sewage ducts larger would swallow millions.
Severely injured after collision
Two drivers were seriously injured in a frontal collision on Landesstrasse 44 near Revensdorf on Friday afternoon.
The police immediately blocked the road completely, but could not say much about the accident at first.
However, there are various testimonials that should be evaluated first.
The 19-year-old driver of a VW Golf was driving towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her with his Hyundai.
The two vehicles collided, the woman being so tightly clenched that the fire department took almost half an hour to get her out of the wreckage.
The actual cause of the accident was initially unclear.
The two deceased arrived in nearby hospitals.
The track remained completely blocked for about two hours.
You could call him the Dostoevsky of the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a God-seeker, a metaphysicist, his novels and stories also have something serious.
Amazing the kinship on the outside: the stunning eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And so, as Fyodor M. Dostoyevsky can be understood with his massive work as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul, you read Philip K. Dick as an American prophet, who is quite important in his own country.
Some titles have appeared in the Heyne publishing house, the Haffmans cassette with the 118 narratives distributes until the second millennium.
Dick explains America - the empire of stunning technical progress, coupled with paranoia, security concerns and the belief to be chosen.
Dick had God experiences, his later books read like a mixture of the Revelation of John and a computer manual.
Maybe he was insane, adding drugs to his brain.
He realized early on that the calculators were divinities.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a man from a machine, the creator from his creature.
This is the Blade Runner problem.
The killing.
A Master of Science Fiction.
A Fantastic Writer.
His stories have inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is now particularly significant.
The "minority report" dates back to 1956, it smells of the Cold War and the McCarthy courts.
The principle of "pre-crime" is developed here, "pre-crime", that is, what is now more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's world, which resembles ours terribly, mutants look to the future - and the police are approaching.
“We are capturing individuals who have not violated any law,” the head of the agency said.
"We'll catch them before they can commit a violent crime."
And: "In our society, there are no serious criminals, for that we have a criminal camp full of criminals."
They assume that bad things happen, and prevent the criminal thought from being put into practice.
Dick’s narrative works like the blue pause for the anti-terror laws and the NSA’s interrogation noise.
Anticipation of the attack: This is how Obama’s drone philosophy and practice works.
But Dick's story isn't over yet.
The chief of police complains that there is no more division of power, the military controls everyday life – and what is left of the state.
Then the watchman himself is monitored and transferred to a future crime.
The system rotates.
It's perfect, but it's lying.
It invents its own prerequisites.
It not only takes mistakes and sacrifices to buy, but builds on them.
The system creates the danger it fights.
Reading Philip K. Dick means always getting closer to the truth.
Talking about Merkel in Russia <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden may also make statements in his Russian asylum case in the U.S. court case about Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German federal prosecutor’s office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia, Interfax reported.
Earlier yesterday, Greens MP Hans-Christian Ströbele was the first German politician to meet Snowden in Moscow to talk to him about the matter.
NSA Disclosures Increase Company Paranoia Due to State Surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew deep across the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt am Main, Germany’s financial capital.
At the direction of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Counter-Terrorism (BVT), the German Interior Intelligence Service, he should photograph the roof of the US outpost, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Federal Bank.
According to German media, the BVT wanted to prove the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a word-change between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, once again insisted in September that the U.S. did not use the possibility of foreign espionage to “steal the business secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies so that they could expand their international competitiveness or their profits.”
But since Edward Snowden, the former employee who became a whistleblower, began publishing his full-horned U.S. surveillance secrets, European governments and corporate leaders are no longer sure whether they can take the lead.
Reports, according to the U.S. National Security Agency spying on Brazilian oil company Petrobas and acquiring data from U.S. cloud providers including Google and Yahoo, have pushed the company’s paranoia due to state surveillance to a new high.
The craziness to overtake brought the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone was related, possibly for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can come to the fore, then company management are also potential targets.
Snowden has made the intensive cooperation between U.S. intelligence services and companies transparent.
I believe it is conceivable that this data will be used for mutual benefit.
“Germany needs to wake up,” explains Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, who represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe the U.S. now poses almost the same risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by advisory firm EY.
However, there is no evidence in Snowden’s documents so far that the U.S. has disclosed the business secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and Internet capabilities and should reduce its dependence on the United States.
The companies are skeptical about this.
In the Bundestag it was proposed that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
“That’s not how it works,” says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you had wanted a strong European IT industry, you wouldn’t have let it go out 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything, including the IT industry.
However, the range and technical sophistication of the US spying authorities discovered by Snowden’s revelations have shocked firms who had previously seen the greatest spy risk in China.
Cloud computing is undergoing a major change because European business leaders are now aware that data stored in the US is subject to its jurisprudence and are therefore potentially endangered.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trading institution, after disclosures about U.S. data mining activities with a prism of about ten percent of non-U.S. members are planning to use an U.S. provider.
Jim Snabe, deputy CEO of SAP, says: “We see a new question from customers that didn’t exist a year ago – it’s: Where are my data stored and can you guarantee that they will stay physically in this jurisdiction?”
Many German business leaders represent the view, the recent reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore must be guarded at all costs.
The fact that economic espionage is taking place is no surprise.
It's always been like that.
“It has been a topic for many years and has not changed fundamentally through the current discussion,” says Kurt Bock, chairman of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us at the commercial and industrial level, just as we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
Corporate governance usually does not brag about the countermeasures taken, as this will provide advantages to attackers.
In large companies, employees have long been told that it is not advisable to bring a free USB stick to a fair or to leave an unattended laptop in the hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberk, a board member at Audi, says it has been a standard practice for years to collect mobile phones before a board meeting to prevent them from being used as hearing aids.
The German BVT advises executives to use simple prepaid phones when traveling abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid phones are thrown backwards.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are world leaders in their respective niche.
“Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets from unauthorized access,” the BVT warns in a report.
The United States warns its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post, the U.S. National Intelligence Estimates ranked France, Russia and Israel behind China in second place among the countries that used to acquire economic data from the hacking.
A member of the board of a German blue-chip company agreed that when it comes to economic espionage, “the French are the worst”.
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French intelligence service DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview with the following words: “The intelligence services know very well that all countries, even if they work together in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
Hechingen: Messe gives answers to wedding questions
“Marriage is the most important journey of discovery that man can make,” said philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips on how at least the wedding celebration succeeds, now gave a special trade fair in the domain in Hechingen.
Representatives were important providers around a wedding.
One trend: The retro look has kept going again.
It starts with the wedding dresses.
White is must, best covered or in cream.
At the front, the dresses are often embroidered and embroidered, often with a veil, at the rear, they go down the back and often end up in a draw.
However, the ghosts differ, as Stefanie Koch emphasizes from the fashion house Kledermüller.
For men, the suit is dominated by vest and plastic, but it is also possible to choose creamy or brown combinations.
Important is the choice of the location, was explained.
Jewelryless side rooms are not optimal, the atmosphere should be special.
Here the domain drew attention to its own offer in the remission.
If you want to go ahead with the cushion, Uwe Link has an offer for you.
"But cushions are also popular for boys ladies farewell," he says.
Romance is also in demand for invitation cards, flower arrangements and also for wedding pictures.
The "after-wedding photo" is becoming more and more fashionable - i.e. shooting series in special places, preferably waterfalls, a few days after the party, but in wedding dresses, explained Elisabeth Keidel.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented in the domain on Sunday.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding table, cake and also a wizard, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests stylishly.
Don’t forget the right cosmetics and nail care.
All for an unforgettable party.
Dog Friends Successfully
For the repeated time, the athletes of the dog-friendly Bitz were successful at a rally-obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Kandel with two dogs; with his puppy Sandy he scored 94 points in the beginner class and secured fifth place, and with 15-month-old Marley he brought it to 12th place with 87 points.

Parents of a Georgian teenager who died in a tragic accident believe in murder
The teenager’s parents, whose body was found in a rolled ring mat in his high school gym, are convinced that her son was murdered, the family’s lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11 in a raised carpet behind the stands in the school gym.
Lowndes County Sheriff's investigative officers concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, which the 17-year-old's family suspected.
“They are convinced that their son was murdered,” Benjamin Crump, the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They would never have believed that he had died as the sheriff concluded.
“They believe that it deprives any logic, violates the laws of physics, as well as the common sense,” Crump said.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth will be concealed to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
“Your son went to school to study and came back in the body bag,” he comments.
U.S. Attorney General Michael Moore said on Thursday that there would be a formal investigation into Johnson’s death as a number of important issues remain unclear.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
This was stated by Moore at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts in which direction they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
“I represent the view that there is sufficient basis for a formal investigation,” he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy indicated that Johnson had died as a result of a "position-related strangulation".
However, a second autopsy resulted in another cause of death, Moore said.
“There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed,” he said.
Moore added that if there is sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson’s death, he will commission the FBI to carry out the investigations.
A representative of the County Sheriff's office was not immediately prepared to comment on our request on Thursday.
A court in southern Georgia on Wednesday ordered authorities to release all surveillance videos that the investigators have checked.
The teenager’s parents said they hoped the videos contained clues as to how he died.
CDC Publish Allergy Guidelines for Schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of guidelines for dealing with food allergies from children in schools.
These are the first such guidelines issued by the U.S. government as the number of school-related children with food allergies increases.
One in 20 children in the United States is now allergic to food.
The prevalence of food allergies among children has increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007, according to the CDC.
The guidelines provide information for schools to raise awareness of food allergies in the faculty and staff and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrine available – the auto-injection of the EpiPen brand is most commonly used – to meet a potentially deadly hypersensitivity reaction.
Legislators in the states have recently changed the regulations so that schools can keep epinephrine more readily available.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms referred to by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, “It feels like something is pressing on my tongue,” “My tongue feels like a hair is lying on it,” or “My tongue is crippling.”
Parents of intersex children can choose “gender indefinitely”
Germany is the first European nation in which a third gender is recognized for children born with unambiguous genitals.
Newborns are no longer assigned rigidly male or female.
Under the new law, parents are no longer required to explain gender to such children, but can indicate “indefinitely” or “undefinedly” on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to take the pressure from parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions regarding sex-assignment operations in newborns, and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
An intersex person said years later, “I’m not a man or a woman.”
I remain the flickering work created by doctors, stunned and full of scars.
An estimated one in 2,000 children a year is not born as a boy or as a girl.
They belong to the intersexuals, a group that falls under the diagnosis of “Sexual Differentiation Disorder” (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, thyroid glands (ovals or jaws) or unusually developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the U.S. recommend using the best available information on gender assignment, if a determination is not possible, and not waiting for the psychological and physical development of the child – if you are expecting an opera before you get married.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the problem of gender identification, said the new German law “sinks after a good thing.”
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgery, but most children don’t,” he said.
You can perform a sex assignment without surgery and then wait for the identity to evolve.
The scientific data on how a child develops his/her sexual identity at all are not very accurate.
No one knows why it's happening.
It’s like the secret why people are gay.
A 2011 report to the European Commission states that intersex persons are different from transsexuals or transgender persons because their status is not gender-related, but because of their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively masculine nor feminine, but typically not defined as either or clearly defined at the same time.
These properties were shown in subordinate sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breast and stature, priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination that intersex and transgender people are exposed to in their professional lives, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys not matching the gender picture now have a special camp.
In Australia and Nepal, it is now possible for adults to indicate male, female or “third gender” on official documents.
In June, Australia’s Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the world’s first “sexless” person after a court granted lifelong retention of an “undefined” gender status.
In addition to M and W, German passports will have a third assignment, X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news release on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French deputies from the strictly Catholic country signed a petition to remove the “gender theory” from school books.
The U.S. website Catholic Online has also spoken against German law, stating: “If the world is torn into a new state where gender is a decision but sexual activity is not, then we twist two other pillars of civilization.”
The mother of a newborn from Maryland told Baby Zone, she found it better if babies are assigned a gender at birth.
“Parenthood is already stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if you don’t know the gender of your own child,” she said.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female genitals were referred to as hermaphrodites, after the attractive Greek god, who had both sexes.
Even ten years ago, medicine saw sex as something that could be erased and then rebuilt.
But in the meantime, the ethical foundations of an operation are questioned, since it is now known how complex the sexual identity is, and that doctors may also be wrong because they do not know how the child feels when growing up with the sex assigned to them.
“In the middle of the 20th century, this was called a ‘psychiatric emergency’,” Drescher said.
When such a child was born, they did not call the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory of treating children with unambiguous genitals goes back to Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who argued that the gender is formable.
He characterised the term “gender identity” and argued that social and environmental abuses – as parents raise a child – interacted with a child’s genes and hormones and characterised whether a person considers himself to be male or female.
However, in a case known as “John/Joan” from 1966, his theories became controversial.
He instructed the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated in a cramped cut to castrate the child completely and also to remove his head and then to draw him up as a girl.
“Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, but it was not,” Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15, he switched back to male and married a woman.
At the age of 38, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
However, in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these sex operations were made public who were “not happy with the result”.
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old Montana author who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous genitals.
The doctors were unclear whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a “satisfactory life” as a man.
So his external organ and hips were removed surgically shortly after birth in 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should receive a vaginal plastic.
But since he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he demanded his medical records.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized when I was born – and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop the genitals.
After learning the truth, he switched back to male identity, received testosterone injections, and allowed his breasts to be removed.
Because of the operation, it has become infertile.
Today, he is fighting for others in an organization called Interface Project to see intersex people as normal.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director of the California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, ensures that the German law can “encourage stamping and stigmatizing”.
“Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and assign the child an ‘undefined’ decision,” she said.
We are afraid that this will favor interventions.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female gender and then wait.
But we still don’t know how the law will work, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law, as it “enables adults to be recognized as a third gender.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex,” she said.
German law deals with the assignment at birth.
This is not a struggle to force small children at this time.
When you grow up, you can decide for yourself about your body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh breast radiologist who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says the German law is “powerful” for both parents and children.
Katie, Baratz’s daughter, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Because of the receptor defect of the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today, Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a psychiatrist.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to be able to have a child through adoption or a nursing mother.
“The law gives parents room, so they don’t have to make overturned decisions,” Baratz said.
It gives them time to do different tests and clarify things, and thus gives them time before they write “male” or “female”.
In this way, everything is fine – you draw the child and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the parental happiness.
And you don’t have to rush into an operation that can no longer be reversed.
“This includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fears that parents drive around because they think they wouldn’t do the right thing,” she explained.
Ultimately, the child decides on the gender that best suits him – and that’s wonderful.
This will enable children to make the decision themselves.
Unknown Injures Girls by Car Shot
A 12-year-old girl in Saxony-Anhalt was injured in a car fire.
The perpetrators allegedly fired at a group of children with an air-pressure weapon on Thursday night in Ghent.
This was reported by the police in Burg.
The girl was slightly injured on the left wade.
Rescue workers took the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car, which was passing by a group of six children and had suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop.
A disc broke.
Then they drove it away.
The police were investigating it, he said on Friday.
Until now, the police inspectorate can look back at Kempten on a quiet Halloween night.
Officials were only called twice to egg-eating children, who threw them against house facades.
Since the homeowners recognized this in a timely manner and removed the egg residues equally, no actual damage was expected.
In addition, some Sylvester bulbs may have been inflamed in the city area, but no damage has occurred here too.
A resident at the Bishop-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car was wrapped in floating paper and his wheelchairs were turned around.
However, until the arrival of the police, the man has rediscovered his radar blinds in the immediate vicinity, which is why the police did not have to continue to operate.
Living with a Future Perspective
Actually, Waltraud Ries lives dreamy.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of greenery, an old tree stock, nice neighbors and also not too much traffic.
The city is only a few minutes by public transport.
"You hope you're not afraid of spiders?" asks Waltraud Ries, pointing to a fat spider on the door frame.
I have been looking for a new home for my husband and me for a while now.
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not spider phobia, but the concern of not being able to cope with the many stairs to the house and in the apartment anymore, she explains.
In addition, since meniscus surgery, the mid-fifty had to learn on her own body what it means to move from floor to floor with a handicap.
Recently, a book from her has been published on the theme ‘Happy living in old age – what kind of living is best for me?’.
‘Our apartment is the best example of what is not going on in old age,’ she begins to tell.
When she moved into the Maisonette apartment with her husband more than 20 years ago, it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the greenery.
Today, at the age of fifty, Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it.
However, she also knows that she is one of the few people who deal with the topic of ‘residential ageing’.
Most people push it as long as it goes.
“Always the others get old,” she says shudderingly.
It is only when the pressure of suffering is really high that one thinks.
“It may be too late,” Ries said.
In her book, the interior designer presents 17 residential models for self-determined living in old age.
“But what kind of housing you choose is always an individual decision,” she explains.
There is no solution for age.
Even those who can afford the retirement seat in Tuscany or Brittany should always think that they can get sick too.
And: 'Without a good knowledge of the national language, one can also unite in the Dolce Vita,' the author of the book considers displacement volunteers.
Among their models are classic care models, alternative forms of living or the often cited pensioner-WG.
In old age, everyone has their ticks and makeup.
'For me, it would be such a housing community but nothing,' she says with a twinkling of eyes.
Not at all like in a student toilet with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
“At age, you just need your retreat spaces,” says Ries.
However, the author does not want to exclude that a senior housing community can still work.
However, this must be done differently than in the classic student-wg.
And sometimes you just want your peace of mind, she believes.
With this view, at least she is not alone in the capital.
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment as long as possible', is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the civil service living in the age of the country capital.
Your service advises people around the topic of ‘becoming older’.
That’s why just older people would often also buy inconveniences and limitations just to be able to stay in their usual environment, which is also the experience of the Foundation’s product test.
Today, there are many ways to make the house or apartment accessible.
Ries recommends that anyone who is involved in the age-appropriate remodeling of their house or apartment should first be thoroughly informed and not hire the best craftsmen.
Today, there are also specialists for age-appropriate remodeling.
Even in the rental apartment, this can be realized one or the other, and if it is only the increase in the toilet seat, the interior designer clarifies.
But the existing apartment can not always be remodeled according to age and thus barrier-free, even if it is still so beautiful.
This experience had to be done by Waltraud Ries.
While one could install a stairlift inside the apartment, the path also paved with stairs to the apartment door would be the much greater obstacle.
She will continue to search until she finds the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before moving, she grinds more than before the spider at her door.
The U.S. wants Snowden to be prosecuted
The United States has not changed its stance on former U.S. intelligence officer Edward Snowden.
He will continue to be accused of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.
That’s why he has to face criminal proceedings in the United States, said U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki in Washington.
Even the recent statements by Snowden would not change that.
Earlier, German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had called on the United States to stop threatening him with punishment after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow.
Psaki stressed that Ströbel’s statements were those of a parliamentarian and not those of a member of the German government.
Intelligence secretary Edward Snowden is basically ready for a conversation with the German authorities.
First, however, he wants to know his situation.
This has been clarified by the former NSA employee sought by the United States in a non-addressed letter published by Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday following a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the Federal Government, the Bundestag and the Federal Attorney General.
The following wording is used after a translation by Ströbele:
To the Competent
I was asked to write to you about your investigation for mass surveillance.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and I was previously employed by contract or through direct employment as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the United States Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA).
In the course of my employment in these institutions, I witnessed systematic violations of the law of my government, which caused me to act out of moral obligation.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I was exposed to a serious and persistent hesitation that forced me to leave my family and my homeland.
I currently live in exile and enjoy the temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation in accordance with international law.
I am encouraged by the resonance on my political actions, both in the United States and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world, as well as senior officials – including the United States – have seen the disclosures of an all-inclusive surveillance system, which is not accountable to anyone, as a service to the public.
These espionage disclosures drew many proposals for new laws and directives aimed at the previously hidden abuse of public trust.
The benefits to society from these findings are becoming increasingly clearer; at the same time the risks acquired have been visibly reduced.
Although the result of my efforts has been proven to be positive, my government still treats dissent as a breach of loyalty and strives to criminalize and prosecute political opinion.
Yet, to speak the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the Government of the United States, with the support of the international community, will reject this repulsive attitude.
I hope that, when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are enclosed, I will be able to make myself accountable to the facts regarding the statements made in the media, in particular with regard to the truthfulness and authenticity of the reports.
I look forward to having a conversation with you in your country as soon as the situation is resolved and thank you for your efforts to preserve the international law that protects us all.

Kindergarten found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Winterlingen's mayor Michael Maier.
The former kindergarten in the Gartenstraße has been sold by the municipality to a private person.
The municipal council agreed to the sale in the non-public part at its most recent meeting.
The building changed its owner to a "reasonable" price.
“The community is satisfied,” Maier stresses.
The budget was <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100,000.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the previous kindergarten.
It is right for the mayor that Winterlingen has handed over the responsibility for the building before winter to someone else and thus no longer has to stand up for the entertainment of the house, like to warm up, to look at the garden and to clean the walkway.
“This effort is now gone,” Maier says.
Concert at high summer temperatures
The Musikverein Hammereisenbach gives a place concert on the terrace of the guest house Hammer.
When conductor Bianca Willmann lifts the batch at 7:30 p.m., the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
Approximately 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of Hammrich musicians.
President Manuela Honeck explains the music.
In this context, Honeck thanked everyone who had helped manage the first musical hock successfully.
Report: Obama campaign considers replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama’s closest advisers have secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden in the 2012 election campaign with Hillary Clinton, the New York Times said.
The revelation is the most remarkable surprise of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's long-awaited work on the 2012 election campaign, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times is facing a copy of the forthcoming book, and it reported on Thursday evening that the president’s top advisers would have conducted “extensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011” to find out whether Obama’s hopes for re-election would be better off.
According to Jonathan Martin, a national political correspondent for the Times, the book thoroughly traces the history of efforts of leading campaign and White House employees, namely the former White House chief of staff Bill Daley, to measure the effect it has on the survey values of the former ex-ministers of the United States.
The potential change was a strictly kept secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president’s closest advisers — including Daley, former campaign leader of Obama, Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisers, David Axelrod and David Plouffe — knew about the planned change.
In "Double Down" it is claimed that Daley was at the forefront of the efforts to exchange Biden despite her "no, personal relationship" before finally deciding against such a chess move, after the data showed that Clinton's candidacy would not be able to "perceive" Obama's chances.
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
“I said a whole series of things to consider, and that was one of them,” Daley told the magazine.
It should be remembered that the president had terrible survey values at the time, so we thought, “For God’s sake, what do we do?”
While Daley referred to the investigations as "mandatory care," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that during the campaign for the re-election, considerable effort had been made to find out whether such a train paid off in terms of the election hours.
“In campaigns, not so much money is spent on surveys and focus groups if you don’t seriously think about something,” Martin told AC360.
It is unclear, however, whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin told CNN that he had asked Daley if his then boss had known about the potential change.
While Daley said he did not believe that the president was “conscious” of the possible change, the former chief of staff admitted it was “possible” that Obama had known about it.
Martin added that “Double Down” did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether the political polls had reached Obama’s desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thinks Obama knew nothing of the investigations about whether to let Biden fall in the election.
“Maybe,” Martin replied.
What happens to my e-mail on the go?
E-mail is actually an electronic letter.
Has the mail secret been technically implemented in the design of the Internet service, similar to the traditional mail?
In the conception of early internet services, it was at the forefront of making communication possible.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols did not pay attention to creating a stable foundation for a hearing-proof correspondence exchange.
Therefore, a conventional email corresponds to an open postcard rather than a sealed letter.
If the user "Anna" sends an email to "Benni", are the computers of the two directly connected?
In the first step, Anna’s email program or browser sends the email to the mail server of her service provider.
For example, if you have a GMail account, it would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses.
On the route, the mail can run over several other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content at his provider.
Will conventional emails be read along their way through the network?
Most emails are read several times on the go by software robots.
The sender’s provider is usually checked to see if the mail carries a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the receiver systems.
In addition, the providers check if this is an annoying and unwanted spam email that is deleted immediately or at least is sorted out into a spam folder.
Do the robots have any other tasks?
For systems such as GMail, the robot also identifies the information Google needs to place context advertising.
If Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their upcoming holiday trip, Google may display corresponding links to holiday offers.
Do strangers also read the e-mails?
The likelihood that unauthorized people will read an email is extremely low.
Theoretically, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read e-mail.
Criminal prosecution authorities and intelligence agencies also have legal means to retrieve or notify e-mails.
This includes possible illegal smuggling operations.
Is it possible to protect emails from reading?
With an OpenPGP standard encryption, an email can be effectively encrypted against messaging.
With high technical effort, it is also possible to hide the metadata of an email communication, so that it is not even possible to recognize without further notice who has communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google in the e-mail market in Germany?
In the mailboxes used mainly privately, Yahoo and Google play only a subordinate role, according to an August 2013 survey by Convios Consulting.
While the shares of Yahoo Mail had last fallen, GMail was able to make it clear from Google.
Mother locks up in the woods and collects pension
When his dated mother died, a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to collect their pensions and care money.
A 67-year-old Wolfsburger has buried his dead mother in the woods in order to continue collecting pensions and care money.
At first he concealed the death of the 89-year-old, then he stole the money for more than a year and a half.
Now the 67-year-old must be held accountable for fraud, as a spokesman said on Friday.
Accordingly, the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was already suspected in May: At the time, it was noted that no drugs were needed for the nursing mother.
The retired man told the investigators that his mother had traveled to Spain.
Because it seemed strange to the officials, they continued to investigate.
It turned out that the two had lived in a joint apartment for more than 15 years and he had last taken care of them.
The 67-year-old finally admitted the death of his mother.
An autopsy, according to the police, did not provide any indications of a capital crime.
Want ice cream that glows in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first ice gleaming in the dark – using Quallen.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of marine animals and created a sparkling treat.
The idea came to him after he had read a research paper on quails and was able to convince Chinese scientists to artificially produce the luminous protein.
The ice cream reacts when consumed with the tongue, thereby increasing the pH in the protein and triggering the lighting.
Chris explains that the ice cream reacts to the heat in the mouth and shines – so the more you lick, the brighter it gets.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious," says: "The product is incredible, but still in a very early stage of production, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH.
When the mouth warms the protein, the pH increases and the ice lights up.
We have tested it in the last few months and it seemed ideal to bring it to market on Halloween because it has this wonderful lighting effect.
It’s probably the most expensive ice cream I’ve ever made, because the candlestick is four times more expensive than gold.
Each bullet costs me about 140 pounds.
But it tastes good for it.
Charlie's experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavours, which include beer, cheese, beef and leaf gold.
But his latest creation is to be even more ambitious.
He says, “I would like to develop an invisible ice cream.”
This is in itself impossible because of the breakdown of light caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream; but I suppose we find a way to create it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a calf artificially produced by Chinese scientists.
The TSV Morsum is still without any points in the handball league after six days of play.
Calculated now, it is for the team of Ingo Ehlers tomorrow to derby against TSV Daverden, who celebrated his first win last weekend.
With this game, the season starts again for us.
"I hope we finally have the head off," Ehlers' attitude is optimistic.
He has finally got his full picture available, except for the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme.
Daverden also bets on speed games.
Therefore, we need to keep our error rate low.
First of all, however, it is important to increase the coverage, which has left nothing but a safe impression.
Daverdens coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after the first season win against Nordhorn.
The game was, of course, a house number.
But that’s why we’re not the favorite for a long time, because in derby everything can happen.
However, Panitz now wants to relegate to Morsum to start a series.
Jan-Malte Yodat will be missing.
For this purpose, the A-Jugend Joost Winduß, who is active with double-playing rights at the A-Jugend Bundesligisten HC Bremen, is celebrating his season debut.
Anyone who is not hot in such a game should stay at home.
Halloween 2013: In Figures
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay late and dress up for the neighborhood.
Today I'm more like a Halloween muffle.
In the last two years I have not declared myself willing to distribute from my apartment of sweets, and will probably not this year.
But according to statistics, I am a black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be exact – are celebrating Halloween this year, spending a total of <0x24>6.9 billion on sweets, costumes and decorations, according to the U.S. Retailers’ Association (NRF).
One thing I look forward to every Halloween is the trend values.
The costumes will make up about 1.2 billion of the <0x24>6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, the last cry is the thrilling, inanimate objects.
Women no longer have to dress in sexy clothes, they can now also embody seductive food like pizza, hamburger or carrots.
As for men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft Punk world dream men will make it into the Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most sought after costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I don't think there's anything wrong with tradition.
We dressed our dogs last year and weren’t alone to my surprise.
In fact, Americans spend <0x24>330 million this year on costumes for their pets, according to the NRF.
That’s a lot of “hot dogs.”
When it comes to sweets, we are not chimpanzees.
Americans will spend <0x24>1.9 billion this year, according to The Nielsen Company.
That’s about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars, slicers, candy and rubber bears.
So good news for the U.S. Department of Commerce, 41 million people dragging through the quarters with the saying “sweet or savory.”
In fact, we’re going to buy over 40 million pounds of chocolate for Halloween and — let’s not worry — eat.
The only thing we don’t want to consume is sugary candy corn; yet 15 million kilograms of it will be sold around Halloween, according to the National Association of Confectionery Manufacturers.
That's about nine billion corn grains.
It's a mystery that I haven't solved yet.
Nothing belongs more to Halloween than houses where it explodes.
They have great names such as "Terror Behind the Walls" (which, by the way, stands in a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized scaffolding houses in the United States that make <0x24>500 million in revenue, says America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos you’re looking at right in your pants and putting your friends on Facebook like you’re standing up for a comment, you’re not going to drop them, and then you’re going to get rid of them.
But let’s finally get to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown familiarized us with the big pumpkin when we were kids, and cutting a pumpkin latte is like decorating the Christmas tree – something we’ve made from a small age.
Fortunately, the “baby in the pumpkin” trend didn’t start until last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us have grown up cutting the pumpkin and not sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend about <0x24>106 million on cucumbers, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lattes, which are slowly rotting in the foreground, probably come from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested this year.
If you want to score the right points, then call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and cut some cute from her 921 kilos of pumpkin.
Home fire in Helmbrechts: Rescue forces mount frozen corpse
Firefighters had to exit in Helmbrechts late Thursday night.
A three-family house in the county of Hof catches fire at night for Friday.
Rescue forces store a chilled body from the house.
Rescuers have found a chilled body in a three-family house in a fire in Helmbrechts.
Whether it is a resident is still unclear, as a police spokesman in Bayreuth said.
Late Thursday night, it had burned down on the ground floor of the house.
When the fire department arrived, the flames were already blown out of a window.
The deputies went into the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room burned out completely.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All other residents were not at home during the fire, the police spokesman said.
The building is no longer habitable.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unclear.
Germany’s largest national church has launched an offensive to promote the pastor’s profession.
There is a potential shortage of priests: The Evangelical Lutheran Landskirche of Hannover expects to halve the number of its currently around 1,800 pastors according to the current situation by 2030.
For today’s young people, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in an interview with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the work and day-to-day flow itself.
With Burfien, for the first time, the Church has commissioned a pastor in a full-time position to inspire young people to study theology.
Currently, fewer and fewer young people choose to study theology after graduation.
Burfien brings this back to the process of de-Churchification: "God's voice is silent, the world is loud".
The profession is characterized by great freedom and diversity.
I am the master of my schedule and can put my focus where it is important to me.
Pastors could be very close to people as a pastor.
They earned as much as teachers and could live well out of it.
Of course, the free economy will pay more, but theologians would have a safe employer for it.
This comes to the young people of today, who are not just about careers, but about a humble job.
According to the National Church, which comprises three quarters of Lower Saxony, about 60 pastors are currently retired each year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology study begin their vicariat.
In suburban areas such as the resin, the Emsland or the Wendland, it may be difficult to occupy jobs in the future.
Burfien aims to organize study days for young people and also invite celebrities who have studied theology.
The theology studies offer a wide range of education.
You can even become a federal president.
Land Rover Rally Series Announced
Inside there are racing seats and six-point belts as well as a free speech system.
The options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with support from Bowler work mechanics and logistics support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, CEO of Bowler Motorsport, explains: “The rally customers who come to Bowler have changed.”
They are not all experienced racers, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure as well as for an accessible way to world-class events.
We are pleased to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new opportunities to experience the various Rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and to prepare newcomers for the Strapazen and the reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge cart – it will be an entertaining championship.
In addition, there is a training and testing day in February at the Defender Challenge, as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighter called to rescue a puppy who was trapped 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock leap in a stone crack
Cockerspaniel dog Ruby ran away after a minor traffic accident
Three days later, she was discovered by a walker in a stonebreaker in her misplaced position.
Firefighters sailed on rock wall and saved the dog from safe death
The firefighter managed to secure a puppy who was trapped in a rock wall on a 15-metre-high leg.
The nine-month-old Cockerspaniel dog Ruby ran away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before being rescued from a stonebreak on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20, to whom the dog belongs, came to the Flappit quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to welcome Ruby back and thank the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service firefighters.
They had desperately searched for their missing dog and posted calls for help on social networks when she ran into the stonebreak after the small traffic accident.
Around 14:15 on Wednesday, a walker who performed his dog saw the beached ruby on the 15-metre-high slope in the rock.
The Cleckheaton Fire Station’s technical rescue team hurried to the spot and sailed to rescue Ruby, which was then transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, specialist of the technical rescue team, said: “She was in a dangerous situation.
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She did not move any muscle during her rescue – she was like frozen.
But now she's fine.
She then ate a few dog cakes.
That was a rather unusual use.
The fact that the dog was discovered is unbelievable.
Peter Lau, specialist of the technical rescue team, said: “Ruby had a huge luck.”
There was the possibility that she was very seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for examination, but he found nothing but exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “Looking at the rescue was scary.”
I couldn't believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep her in the arms again.
The veterinarian explained that if the exhaustion had become too large and it had collapsed, it would probably have collapsed.
The firefighters have done great.
It was really courageous what they did.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson of Keighley added, “We were afraid she would fall, but she stayed up.”
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger says he never married Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said she has worked as a background singer on Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard".
Perry explained that she had dinner with the old man, and that “he dumped me when I was 18.”
She added: “It’s been a long time and he was very nice to me.”
In a statement, a 70-year-old Jaggers spokesman said on Thursday he “categorically denies that he has ever attempted to approach Katy Perry.”
The representative added: “Maybe she confused him with someone else.”
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance on this year’s Rolling Stones tour.
Her new album "Prism" landed at No. 1 this week.
George Kerevan: European detachment gives Scotland the choice
A new day, a new horror story about independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland is required to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a barbed wire secured border along the Adrian wall.
In fact, the Strathclyde template pointed out the possible economic benefits that would bring more travel freedom in the rest of Europe, but this – as expected – did not play a role in the headlines.
Also, no one has mentioned that EU Member States often turn to their strict rules when it is more favourable for them.
Since Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, continuing non-observance for Brussels would only be a small concession in return for what one really wants from the Scottish people.
Actually not a story.
And one that has come in so many years that it already resembles a fossil: the first time I heard the “Independence Means Passport Controls” entity at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient history.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to dance after the European pipeline?
Why is the London yoke swapping against the Brussels yoke, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great post-war plan for the unification of Europe has come to an end.
With the Euro crisis, the project Europe has officially died.
Everywhere in the EU, parties are gaining ground that are EU-enemy or want to throw the euro as a Community currency overboard.
Even in Germany, the Euroskeptic party Alternative for Germany, founded this year, was able to raise almost five million votes in the September federal election and thus effectively expel free democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic resistance against the plan to create a federalist Europe.
However, the current economic crisis turns out to be a turning point.
Due to the strict austerity policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in conjunction with the compulsory jacket in which the respective national economy is forced to stick to the common currency, many people believe that the project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments are causing excessive budget deficits – that was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has set its members on exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – and German politicians would like to do so.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the local currency, southern Europe will find itself with a built-in productivity deficit against Germany.
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – driven by Berlin.
Behind the current state and currency problems lies a deeper problem of European productivity.
As a result of the ‘green’ energy directives prescribed by Brussels – a code for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as the United States.
This is a detrimental cost night, as we could see in Grangemouth.
All of the world’s salary records do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap American slippery gas.
As a result, a revolt, especially in France, attracts the former cheerleader of the EU.
After the war, the political elite of France saw the EU as a vehicle with which to keep Germany in check and raise Paris to the eye with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy, and Europe has pushed up its own economic policy, with which the French economy has to fight.
The result: Marine Le Pen’s right-wing, EU-enemy Front National has just won a decisive re-election, thus referring the ruling Socialists to number three.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume a split in the right spectrum would automatically be advantageous for the left.
What does Le Pen do with its newly gained popularity among the white French of the working class?
She wants to use the next year’s EU elections to forge an anti-EU, anti-community currency block in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties are doing well in these elections – and that is very well possible – then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I want to go beyond: in the near future, the growing resentment against the EU and the common currency will come together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will rather become something like the "Europe of (sovereign) nations" that General de Gaulle favored.
Germany and some of its satellite economies may hold onto the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of interfering with the United States.
However, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where is Scotland in all this?
We can decide to be a region of (in the last consequence) Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including telling Berlin and Brussels what they can hide from where.
I assume that Scotland could be doing very well in a more relaxed European union, provided that we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other countries with similar thinking is easier in a non-federated Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider doing the same for Norway and retaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – remarkably – the most successful political movement against austerity policy in Europe and won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed (and implemented) cuts that Labour finance minister Alistair Darling has made in response to the responses of the Labour finance minister to Koli-ten and the following:
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to decide now for independence only to have a austerity policy imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: growing up faster
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white counterparts, as research shows.
Physical changes do not mean puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible.
Experts believe epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be worried if her daughter grows breasts and sham hair at the age of seven or eight?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics Association this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and represented a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time calming parents – usually that’s not a sign that puberty is coming soon,” Kaplowitz explained.
Obvious indications of development, such as growing breasts, sham and axle hair, as well as body odor, appear earlier in girls.
However, there was only a slight shift in the age of the menarche (the appearance of the first rule bleeding) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
“When breast development begins, it takes at least two to three years for menarche to develop,” said Kaplowitz, also author of the book Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Advice to Deal with This Common Problem.
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses.
It is controversial, which is actually the beginning of puberty, but it is “early” when breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth boost before the age of eight.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates – something that a pediatrician can closely monitor.
With faster progress, tests may be indicated by an endocrinologist so that serious problems such as tumors or cysts can be excluded.
There are methods of treatment to delay an early menstruation and prevent another consequence: premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for medication or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is restrained when it comes to medications, but he admits: “Repressing puberty can alleviate behavioral problems and feelings of girls being different from their peers.”
The other big problem is understandable: parents just don’t want their very young daughters to have the period.
“They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygiene side,” Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls a woman whose daughter got her days at the age of ten.
Although there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was emotionally unprepared.
She came home scared and excited from school because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media are causing.
Boys are similar to girls in puberty.
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine, which created a link between body fat and entry into puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white counterparts.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, early puberty seems to be influenced by all sorts of things, from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another mystery: Although boys’ facial and scalp hair grows earlier, the trend towards a full-fledged earlier puberty is not as pronounced as with girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference underline the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and sham hair is common even in babies and toddlers.
“We need to be careful how we identify the true beginning of puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to consult their pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
“This can mean that you have to have a conversation earlier than expected,” Kaplowitz said.
When you stay calm, the child usually reacts well.
Girls who bloom early need the assurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it occurs earlier than thought.
Jumbo manufacturers argue over seat width in the face of large orders
Among the leading aircraft manufacturers, there has been a debate over the breadth of tourist-class seats on long-haul flights, which sounds like a bitter collision at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute is about the seat width that passengers are offered on long-haul flights in the tourist class – not always the ones that the airlines are most striving for, but this designated space is the key to the efficiency claims of the latest aircraft of Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus called for an industry standard this week that prescribes a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but U.S. rival Boeing says it should be decided by the airlines.
The dispute comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-haul aircraft, and expect record orders at the event from 17 to 21 November.
As the rear of the aircraft is designed – especially if there are rows with nine or ten seats – it is crucial for the stated economic results that the new “mini-jumbo” design is supposed to deliver.
Boeing claims its modernized “777X” holds 406 people in tourist-class seats that are over 17 inches wide and thus allow ten per row.
Airbus says the competitive version of the A350 carries 350 passengers in 18-inch wide tourist-class seats, with nine per row.
Aircraft giants often distribute leverage over technical details by means of advertising in the specialist press.
Now, Airbus is appealing to the public before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to do the race with over 100 orders.
Recently, the company presented an ad that could be the beginning of a new ad war and showed money donors a picture of three people sitting together in a restaurant, with the title, “Would you accept that?”
“Boeing proposes long-haul flights in seats that are narrower than regional turbo props,” said John Leahy, Airbus’ chief sales officer.
Given changes in eating habits, people are getting thicker, but airplane seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined modern long-distance travel, and the end of the century, the weight of the average male American between the ages of 40 and 49 increased by ten percent, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.
The waist circumference of the average male American in the 21st century is 10.8 cm, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says its rival adheres to a seat concept from the 1950s when the average body circumference of the freshly dipped “Jet Set” was narrower.
According to Airbus, studies have shown that an additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat increases sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing is contesting Airbus’ figures on seating dimensions and says it is not in the manufacturers’ discretion to decide how airlines shape the balance between air fares and facilities.
The company also explains that, according to investigations, the experience on the plane depends on more than the seat width.
“It’s really about giving airlines flexibility so they can do what they think they need to be successful,” explains Boeing’s airline expert Kent Craver.
They don’t want us to dictate what makes them profitable.
You know your business better than anyone else.
For passengers, it is about more elbow freedom, but for manufacturers, it will become an increasingly important issue that can have an impact on sales.
There is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least <0x24>700 billion at list prices in the coming decades, which could have a sustained impact on the export balance of the United States or Europe.
As Reuters first reported in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the dispute over the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long-range designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
Boeing’s statements on the results depend in part on the fact that the 777X is compared with its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased cost per unit is still lower than the machines currently used with ten seats per row.
“Boeing is therefore squeezing more seats into its aircraft to make it more competitive to our products,” said Kevin Keniston, Head of Passenger Comfort at European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say full cabins with ten seats per row at the existing 777s indicated that many passengers opted for the narrower arrangement, which could come with cheaper flight fares.
“Eighteen inches of seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, the Airbus range is controlled by the threat from the 777,” says Mary Kirby, Cabin Installation Expert, Founder and Publisher at Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The world-traveling jet salesmen even carry band size to measure the facility in the competition.
Even if they appreciate comfort, all manufacturers also offer high-density jets for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seat rows, but has not yet sold one.
Until recently, Airbus has emphasized the importance of more adaptability of the cabins and offered wide seats on the slopes for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the reputation for a new industry standard is likely to fade, but could distract from the wave of 777X sales.
New anti-nicotine vaccine could make the pleasure of smoking the garaus
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice for a lifetime from nicotine addiction.
Human testing requires further trials, which may take a few more years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results were good.
“We are very hopeful that this kind of vaccination strategy can once help millions of smokers who have tried to quit while trying all the methods available on the market, but had to experience that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches,” Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified so that it contains the genetic information to produce nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt down the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which means a smoker does not experience a high nicotine level.
In experiments, vaccinated mice who were given nicotine maintained their normal activity levels.
Mice without vaccination, on the other hand, would have taken a “time out,” the researchers explained, a sign that nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
Vaccinations had to be given so often to maintain antibody levels that they were expensive and impractical.
However, the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be considerably lower as it transforms liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for humans could be given to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine addiction.
More likely, however, smokers would use it to quit.
“They know then: if they start smoking again, they no longer feel pleasure because of the nicotine vaccine, and that helps them break the habit,” he explains.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that further research was needed.
Tripods resist being influenced by both
Former Labour Party minister Joe Tripodi from New South Wales is being investigated by the state oversight of corruption.
The former NSW minister is opposed to amending maritime shipping regulations at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden stakes in three lands on state-controlled land.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigations on Friday on whether the two ministers of state had influenced the agreements at Circular Quay, where the two operated two restaurants and a café, without a call for tenders after their August 2005 expiration.
Now it is determined that Tripodi was aware of Obeid's hidden interest in the property, after Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff Lynne Ashpole said on Thursday.
In years of talks that began in 2005, the government had pushed for public tenders for the contracts.
The guards were against it and also wanted longer periods of service.
In 2009, the contracts for the companies at Circular Quay, which brought the two <0x24>2.5 million annually, were extended without a public tender.
Tripodi, who served as Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally voted for public tenders.
However, he disagreed that the changes had been made at the request of both, who, as Tripodi confirmed, had pushed for a restructuring of the government's patch arrangements.
A telephone record submitted to the ICAC showed talks from August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had moved to the port ministry after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Authority.
“Was the issue discussed in these telephone conversations the development of commercial package arrangements?” asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
“No,” said Tripod.
I can’t remember what was discussed, but it definitely wasn’t.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli fighter jets attack target in Syria, official sources say
Israeli fighter jets attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night, a senior government official told Fox News.
The official did not explain what the target was, but said there was at least one.
According to the Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125 missiles.
Israel has already airstriked missile deliveries in Syria at least twice this year.
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to ‘authenticity test’
In the context of extended measures, the government is considering a “authenticity test” for foreign workers with a 457 visa.
If the test is to be introduced, it will be used using a criterion to prevent the 457 being used to occupy unqualified jobs or as a backdoor for bringing family and friends to Australia.
A government discussion proposal was released today after former Labour MP Maxine McKew condemned comments made by the government on foreign workers because they could be seen as insulting by Australia’s neighbors.
“Noisy statements like ‘foreigners are set behind’ and ‘Australians are set first’ are a very unpleasant decline in times when trade unions are demanding a protected labour market,” she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region had an echo of this historical artifact, I wouldn’t be surprised.
The discussion proposal outlines twelve measures that were once envisaged by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who spoke yesterday about human trafficking in Sri Lanka, has implemented five of the recommended amendments, the others are still being considered.
If the ‘authenticity criterion’ is adopted, then anyone applying for a visa could be verified to see whether ‘the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is related to the holder or a relevant person of the supporting undertaking or is personally related.’
Companies could also be obliged to account for the number of 457 visa holders, after in the past companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers finally hired hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum-seeker is believed to have died of a heart attack after arriving this week on a refugee boat on the Christmas Island.
The troubled nine-year-old son of the man who had come with him to Australia has been taken care of by an adult cousin who was also on board since his father’s death on Wednesday.
Australian authorities took the man to the Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
The UK government has announced a study aimed at increasing the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
HS2 Ltd’s work proposes to establish high-speed connections between Scotland and the North of England from the start of Phase 1 in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project "will bring the UK closer together".
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the British government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed train connection between London and the West Midlands.
After the completion of Phase 2, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government adjusted the estimated cost of building the high-speed highway between London and Northern England from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6 billion.
The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to look for further route capacities and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a trip time of last three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is a truly national route network that brings the UK and its cities closer together.”
We are moving forward with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits.
Without it, we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it is also about the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Carmichael to “indisputably” pursue Scottish involvement in the HS2 network.
Brown said: “The high-speed rail connection has the potential for enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time also provides Scotland’s economic power with an argument for fast rail connections across the UK.”
That is why we are pleased to work as a partner of the British Government and to explore the options for a high-speed rail connection in Scotland that creates benefits for everyone and complements the Glasgow-Edinburgh connection that the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the inquiry report with the British ministers next year and deciding together on the next steps.
Regulations on electronic devices in aircraft will remain in force in Australia for the time being
Australian air passengers will still have to switch off tablets and smartphones at launch and landing, despite efforts in the U.S. to loosen the rules for such devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows U.S. airlines to change their specifications so that passengers on their devices can read, watch or play e-books during critical flight phases if they are in “flight mode”.
Passengers are already allowed to do this during most of the flight, but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-books when they take off and land.
Australian airlines are observing the decision that the U.S. airlines must implement innumerable amounts of work, but do not pursue immediate plans to change their regulations.
The air safety authority CASA also stated that the announcement will be reviewed, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases in Australia continue to apply.
“CASA currently has no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic devices on board the aircraft,” it said.
The subject matter is subject to provisions which require airlines to maintain safety at all times and passengers to follow the safety instructions given by the cabin staff.
Virgin has already held talks with CASA about an extension of its Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights and has stated that it is open to changes, but these need to be initiated by the legislator.
“We would welcome a review of the approval of electronic devices by CASA because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience after we now offer (wireless entertainment) during the flight,” a spokesman said.
Qantas has stated that it will remain in compliance with current regulations until further notice.
“Our current guidelines provide that electronic devices are not allowed to be used during start-up and landing, and we currently have no plans to change that,” the company said.
The FAA regulations apply to U.S. airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that passengers can benefit from, and we will certainly look closely at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision is different for U.S. companies depending on the age of the fleet.
You need to prove that your aircraft can tolerate radio interference by mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, handbag programs, and customer instruction.
“After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lighter electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones of any height,” the FAA said in a statement.
In rare cases, in case of poor vision, the crew will instruct the passengers to turn off the equipment during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier equipment should be safely stored under the seat or in the compartments above the seats when starting and landing.
Before the Revierderby against Schalke, several BVB supporters with light rackets had taken care of ugly scenes in the Veltins arena.
Borussia Dortmund then announced severe consequences.
Before Friday's Bundesliga game against VfB Stuttgart, the ultras reacted with a silence - first of all.
It was an unusual, almost ghostly acoustics that offered the viewer until shortly before the start of the Bundesliga game between German vice-champion Borussia Dortmund and VfB Stuttgart in the Signal Iduna Park.
Most of the guests were listening to their songs.
The Southern Tribune, on the other hand, where the most loyal – and loudest – BVB fans stand, initially presented itself exceptionally quietly: no songs, no battle calls.
The Capo’s podium, which otherwise coordinated the joint fire, remained unoccupied.
And right in front of the stands was a large flag with the inscription "Stadion Ban Section".
Only as the goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller, as always the first BVB player to take the place, burned up short-term joy.
As his teammates followed, there was loud singing and wailing clams – but not everywhere for a long time.
There was nothing in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the South Tribune.
Also, the fact that stadium spokesman Norbert Dickel once again enumerated the positive experiences of the last days - Derby victory, victory over Arsenal, contract renewal by coach Jürgen Klopp - did not provide a celebration.
Only five minutes before the whistle, the capo climbed up his podium – and the tension that had been tangible with his hands so far was unraveling in a loud scream as the mood on the ranks of the stadium was, as usual, dickered.
Lastly, as always, the Southern Tribüne was on its way – and finally here was again, as usual, the loudest place in the stadium.
And at the latest, when the loud call "Derbysieger is up" came from the South Tribune, everything was back, as always.
The silence in the past was probably a reaction to the events of the past few days.
Just before Revierderby at FC Schalke 04, some of the most expensive BVB trailers had fired light railings into the spectator’s rows and onto the square – with almost goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller hitting.
The game was delayed due to the chaotic scenes.
BVB boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the tip of the Dortmund Ultras in his office – and if you believe Watzke’s words, this was a rather uncomfortable date for the fans.
"There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra-movement," the BVB boss announced at a podium discussion in Frankfurt on Thursday night.
As an immediate measure, Watzke banned the Ultras from choreography for the home game against VfB Stuttgart.
"I have forbidden that," he explained.
We cannot give up the zero-tolerance policy in terms of pyrotechnics.
In addition, the ultras were shown different ways of punishing - by Tuesday, they now have time to decide on one.
Otherwise, says Watzke, the BVB will impose a sanction by the end of next week.
"That's going to be cut-off," Watzke assured.
You may be wondering how the reactions on the South Tribe will be.
Plumbing houses boom in Singapore as the crisis in the middle class has arrived
Janani Amirthalinga wears a gold bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings in a parlor house in the Bendemeer shopping center in Singapore to pay the school fees for her daughters.
“My husband and I just bought a house, that’s where all my money is in it,” says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns <0x24>3,000 each month as an administrative employee and her husband also works, her monthly family income is not enough, she explains.
In fact, demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is increasing – is so high that ValueMax, where it traded, became the third brewery listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Finding jewelry is not only a quick way to get money – <0x24>1,300 in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, mortgages in Singapore require an effective annual interest rate of 17 percent, which is just over the 15.4 percent required by the United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping mall.
However, mortgages offer the advantage that there is no credit check or income certificate required here, which is why loans are possible faster than with banks.
For this reason, millions of people in the region turn to pancakes, after families feel the pressure from rising living costs as well as rising household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and low-cost loans due to a loose financial policy in developed economies, low- and middle-income families are looking for mortgages to compensate for the difference in a shocking economy.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor’s growing household debt, mainly due to rising mortgages, was identified as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest domestic debt in Asia in terms of gross domestic product, according to the Agency.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 percent of GDP, an increase of 60 percent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high consumer debt in Thailand, which almost emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continued export weakness and a decline in consumer demand.
“In the end, this means that in view of rising costs, people in the middle to lower segment (the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible,” says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical peaks in gold prices over the past two years have further strengthened the trend towards locking personal items, as people take advantage of the opportunity to turn family jewelry into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the items incurred are gold in the city state’s 200 mortars.
People say to each other, “The gold price looks good, let’s get Grandma’s gold chain and get it back next month.”
Thailand’s largest pancake house operator, EasyMoney, has experienced a 20 percent customer growth in its branches in recent months.
ValueMax, which operates its branch in Bendemeer and another 15 in Singapore, wants to expand not only to neighboring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, managing director of Valx.
The company finances it with 60 percent of the <0x24>66 million it took this week with the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some lenders have been caught in the crossfire due to high interest rates, Yeah explains that Pfandhäuser not only fined more favourable interest rates than other lenders, but also did not directly increase debt.
“Customers are harassed by items they already own, and the liquidity of personal valuables does not increase budget training,” she explains.
The loan business is increasingly socially accepted as short-term, secured financing.
Also, not all people who use loans are in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come to the stores of ValueMax to borrow gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Customers from all walks of life come to us.
“This includes wealthy people borrowing something for a business or an investment in the short term, or small businesses that need to bridge gaps in the cash flow,” says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
NSA sucks data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
Intelligence detective Edward Snowden has a fundamental interest in helping Germany to unravel the ever-brittle NSA spy cases.
According to Hans-Christian Ströbele, a member of the Greens Bundestag, at his surprise meeting with Snowden in Russia, it was about the conditions under which former intelligence officers would testify at a German prosecutor’s office or before an inquiry committee.
Snowden has referred to his complicated legal situation, Ströbele told ARD magazine "Panorama".
Rescue package of over <0x24>325 million for Tasmanian health care
The Australian government insists on the harsh conditions linked to the rescue package of over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian health care, to ensure that the federal government cannot waste the money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take "immediate action" to avoid a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic diseases and systemic restrictions.
The funding for a four-year period was decided after consultations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has drafted an emergency relief package that, in our view, addresses the unique challenges facing the state,” Plibersek said today.
The <0x24>325 million package includes <0x24>31 million emergency assistance for election services.
A further 2,600 surgeries, including orthopaedic interventions and treatments due to grey star, are to be eliminated.
In addition, there is money available for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better post-patient care, specialist training, mental health services and the introduction of an electronic system for recording health data in local hospitals.
“These investments are in line with the ideas that affected clinic staff told me they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system,” said Tanya Plibersek.
The minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability obligation of the Tasmanian government.
The state must maintain the current level of funding in order to receive money from the Commonwealth, and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A three-headed Commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides health services as efficient and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie explained today, the <0x24>325 million would only be of little use if “they are not accompanied by real reforms that will bring the Tasmanian public health system to a more sustainable course.”
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his urgent request for help, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
“I am confident that federal aid will make a big contribution to taking the state’s public health system from the concern list,” Wilkie said.
According to the federal government, these elections will largely compete with the recent cuts.
But the health policy spokesman of the opposition at the federal level, Peter Dutton, believes that today’s announcement is only a “plaster solution”.
“We are in a situation today because the lab government has withdrawn <0x24>430 million from the health system,” he told ABC TV.
It can’t be that a state government pulls almost half a billion dollars out of the system and the Commonwealth gets 300 million in and then pretends to be the good news.
Dutton called on Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the bailout package will be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux's adaptation of the novel by Denis Diderot convinces with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details, but is also more expensive than necessary.
Playing in France in the 1760s, it tells the captivating story of Suzanne, a young nobleman sent to the monastery by her family.
When she rebels, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic top and becomes the object of an erotic fascination of another.
The film never slips away in luxuries or sensational loss – and that’s the problem.
The solemn serenity with which the film is told also makes it a tortured t-shirt for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons, according to a surveillance group
Syria has destroyed key chemical weapons and poison gas ammunition manufacturing facilities, the Global Chemical Weapons Monitoring Group said on Thursday, while there were serious clashes in the north of the country near one of the sites where allegedly toxic substances are stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed three years ago since the start of the civil war.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came a day before the date.
1 November, the organization established in The Hague, Damascus, to destroy or “inoperable” all chemical weapons manufacturing facilities, including all machinery for mixing chemicals into poison gas and replenishing ammunition.
The completion of this process, which essentially represents the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone of an ambitious timetable aimed at the destruction of all chemical weapons in Syria by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus must still begin to destroy the existing weapons and supplies.
It is estimated that there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came at a time when fighting took place in the city of Safira on Thursday, by the experts saying that there was a chemical weapons production facility here as well as warehouses, according to the United Kingdom-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
The activist group, which tracks the death toll through a network of activists in Syria, said on Thursday that 122,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 children.
On government sides, 29,954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 were government-friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Also among the dead are 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since March 2011 at 100,000.
This figure has not been updated yet.
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country.
Assad’s troops have been fighting in Safira for weeks against the rebels, many of whom have links to al-Qaeda groups.
The observatory said there were losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not mention details.
The fights underline the danger posed by the chemical weapons inspectors, as their mission to free Syria from its toxic arsenal of weapons is a race against time amidst a tumultuous civil war.
According to the OPCW, which is working closely with the United Nations, the team is “now convinced that it has seen all the important production and mixing/filling facilities mentioned by Syria and co-existed with their destruction.”
Therefore, “no further inspection activities are currently planned.”
Earlier this week, the inspectors had declared that they had completed the first round of inspections and visited 21 of the 23 places indicated by Damascus.
Due to security concerns, it was not possible to visit two facilities, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPWC stated that the two sites had been “abandoned . . . and the chemical weapons program objects there had been moved to other listed facilities that had been inspected.”
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month.
“I draw the hat from the courage and courage that you have all shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization,” said Ahmed Uzumcu, the Director General of the Surveillance Organization, in a statement released by OPCW.
For three years now, mainly Sunni Muslim rebels have been fighting in this civil war against Assad’s government and its security forces, many of whom are members of the Alawites, a division of Shi’ite Islam.
In view of further developments, the head of the observation group, Rami Abdurrahman, said on Wednesday there was a strong explosion in an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is not known, he said.
Anger over judgment for Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who were killed in the Bali bombing in 2002 reacted angry at the judgement for the last of the founders, who was brought to court after Umar Patek, in her opinion, should be shot legally.
Patek, who had been on the run for nearly ten years as one of Southeast Asia’s most wanted people, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in building explosives.
He could be sentenced to 15 years’ imprisonment.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for attacking two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many others were injured.
A charge was also filed in a number of terrorism-related allegations, including a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutor’s office had demanded a life sentence, even if it could have applied for the death penalty for the man who was also referred to as “Demolition Man” because of his reputation as a master bomber.
The decision has aroused painful memories at June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the devastation that Patek and his co-conspirators caused nearly a decade ago.
Fighting with tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I mean, he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
“You should put him before a shooting command,” Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day so that I will not have any other grandchildren and I will never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was equated to the ground when on October 12, 2002, shortly after 23:00, a huge bomb exploded in a small truck parked in front of the nightclub.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar, where just 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber exploded a bag full of explosives.
He fell into a coma for a month after the attack and “died” three times while hung on a life-sustaining system.
Hughes said Patek deserved the same fate as the other three members of the Jemaah Islamiah terror cell – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodshed and were executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty in front of everyone else.
Letting him live – no, there is no reason to let him live.
To have 20 years after he killed 202 people and wounded many hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last Bali bomber to face trial.
He retired from the detention for nearly a decade, but was eventually arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden just four months later.
During the hearing, an FBI agent said intelligence reports reported that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the link between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
“He didn’t sit down,” Corteen said.
Until recently, he has not shown remorse for how much suffering he has added to other people.
The verdict was preceded by the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which will be commemorated in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of tears this year,” Corteen said.
Patek can still appeal against his judgment.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices in planes (but don’t make phone calls)
Air travelers can now use their electronic devices to read, work, play, listen to music and watch movies from departure to landing, but not to phone with their mobile phone, according to the new guidelines issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
How quickly they would be implemented depends on the respective airline, FAA employee Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
The airline must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the flight personnel’s training manuals as well as the rules for the storage of equipment in accordance with the new regulations.
The FAA said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
“Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon,” the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers have to turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the airplane doors are closed.
They are only allowed to restart when the plane has reached an altitude of three kilometres and the captain gives green light.
When entering the landing flight, the passengers must turn it off again and must not restart it until the plane has landed.
According to the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are secured against electronic interference could allow their passengers to use the devices even on start-up, landing and on-field, FAA said.
Most new transport aircraft and other aircraft that have been re-equipped to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the professional flight attendant association, welcomed the changes.
“If the new regulation is implemented safely – and we are working closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit from it,” Glading said.
To be honest, we are sorry to have to be a caretaker on this issue.
However, Internet connections for surfing, exchanging emails, text messages or downloading data less than three kilometres remain prohibited, the authority said.
Passengers are asked to move smartphones, tablets and other devices into flight mode.
So still no "Words With Friends", the Scrabble-like online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he had to leave a jet of American Airlines for public reasons because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked on board.
And heavier devices such as laptops still need to be hidden, as there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin.
Cell phone calls during the flight are also still prohibited.
The regulatory competence for telephone conversations lies with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not with the FAA.
FAA may lift ban on certain electronic devices at launch and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national traffic safety expert on CBS News, said mobile phones would still be considered a risk.
“Handys are really a problem not only because they could potentially cause interference with navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that transmission from the air can also interfere with transmitters,” Rosenker said.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to investigate this issue last month recommended that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure has increased on the FAA to ease restrictions on use.
Critics like Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri say there are no valid reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to implement because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous.
In some studies, it is the case that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore turning off the device.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by air passengers in 1966, after reports of disturbances of navigation and communication devices were made known by UKW radios carried by passengers, which were the latest technology trends at the time.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that they don’t care about electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi for several years when the altitude has been reached.
The flyers adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more insensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the stronger use of electronic devices under the new directives, Huerta said.
Today’s electronic devices generally emit significantly less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-readers, for example, only emit minimal radiation when blurred.
However, when downloading or sending data, the transfer values are stronger.
Amazon.com is one of the advocates of easing restrictions on the use of devices by passengers.
In 2011, employees of the company purchased a passenger plane full of Kindle e-readers and made a test flight to identify problems, but could not detect them.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk associated with the use of equipment.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he believed the disruption caused by the aircraft was real, even though the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said that there are only individual reports of pilots talking about a disruption of aircraft systems by the devices, and most of them are very old.
The Committee, however, recommended that the FAA allow pilots to arrange for the passengers to switch off the equipment in case of instrument landing under poor visibility conditions.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a reasonable adaptation for travelers who would be extensively equipped with technology today.
“We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not at odds with safety,” said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Released Bird Rescued by North Sea Borinsula Air Rescue Service
A bird flying by air rescue service to the coast, which had been found exhausted on a North Sea drilling island, was released back into nature.
The water slider was flown to Aberdeen last month by helicopter, where it was dumped by the Scottish animal welfare organization SPCA at its rescue centre in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the center, said: “This water raft was probably a wintering train bird from northern Europe that was stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea.”
Apparently, the exhausted bird was seeking refuge on the welling island.
He added: “He could no longer fly further, which is why we were contacted with the request for help.”
When she was released, the water wheel was fit and healthy again.
Is Europe’s elite ready to do business with the UK?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those who want to bring about prosperity and work in the UK want to change our relations with the EU.
To this end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey among British economic leaders and asked them what they thought about the UK, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 leaders from the economy, representing approximately the sizes, sectors and regions of the UK.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the overwhelming majority of companies now export outside of Europe and focus on countries that are modernizing and growing while the countries in the EU are stagnating.
They want the government to promote new trade ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than stopping the long and energetic process of reforming the obscure EU institutions.
Asked about certain legal issues – from cartel law to product legislation – the majority of economic leaders believe that control over these key competencies should be regained after Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the internal market, as according to the companies, the costs of the Brussels regulations would now outweigh the advantages of being part of the European trade zone – even 40% of large companies agreed with the most traditionally European-friendly ones.
Finally, and that’s probably the most, our survey of economic leaders found that a clear majority of the United Kingdom wants a course towards changing the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not politics.
This insight, found in companies of all sizes and leading companies, shows that the economy is pushing for a “significant change” that brings the leaf of trade back to the UK.
It’s about a lot – a change to the agreement and better conditions for the UK would lead to a 16 percent change of opinion in favour of staying in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: This survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan to renegotiate British conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a significant shift in power ratios back to the UK from a renegotiation.
A better deal for the UK economy is possible and increasingly necessary as the eurozone is now moving towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the result of our survey shows, which means for companies a stronger focus on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulation.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom Calls Bulgaria's Pipeline the Beginning of a New Gas Era
The construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria is the start of one of Europe’s largest energy projects, the Gazprom Board of Directors said.
“Today’s event is a milestone: construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun,” Gazprom’s CEO Alexei Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream aims to ensure more diversity in Russia’s export routes across Europe.
A contract dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, where most of Russia’s gas is stored for Europe, poses an increased risk on conventional routes, as can be heard from the official side.
Miller said the direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were “forever” excluded.
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at discounted rates when the entire project goes into operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work in other subordinate countries will begin on the planned route by the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
For national and international investors, there is no way to pass the real estate location of Germany.
The economic framework data are correct, and the funding options are excellent.
This was the tenor of the 9th real estate store of the stock market newspaper.
The German real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and the good economic conditions in the country compared to Europe.
Christian Ulbrich, CEO Europe, Middle East and Africa of Jones Lang LaSalle, pointed out this at the 9th real estate day of the Börsen-Zeitung.
According to Ulbrich, looking at the volume of transactions is what German commercial real estate is looking for.
In the first three quarters of this year, it increased by 31% compared to the previous year’s section.
In the UK, the plus was only 6%, in France it was 19%.
"Immobilier investments offer an attractive interest rate," said Ulbrich.
The yield gap between real estate and federal bonds is at a historically high level.
The FAA is easing restrictions on the use of electronic devices on airplanes – even if phone calls are still prohibited.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA employees charged with charges against Jonathan Lord for sexual offences
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) have been charged with sexual offences related to children before charges were filed against childcare worker Jonathan Lord from Caringbah in 2011, according to the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children.
However, in the opening statement before the Commission, the YMCA had stated that “the organization has never had to deal with an incident of sexual child abuse.”
Chief Executive Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which one YMCA employee had been charged with child pornography offences, and another in which a sports teacher at YMCA Caringbah Hall had been convicted of abuse of children entrusted to him in 1991.
Hare said Gail Furness, an assistant lawyer to the Commission, knew about the first case but did not know the second.
He admitted that the YMCA’s opening statement to the Commission was also inaccurate in the claim that “there have been external inspections of the YMCA, in which the YMCA was recognized as the leading front in child safety”.
Evidence before the Commission rather shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest possible assessment of four in a quality audit by the Department of Education and Communities in August of the year.
Hare, who started at YMCA at age 21, admitted that the management failed “from me down” in hiring Lord and did not ensure that employees had been clear about their obligations to report violations of child safety policies.
Lord had been convicted of sexual offences against twelve boys during his two-year tenure for the YMCA at the beginning of the year.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
However, Hare argues that the YMCA had a cultural problem that kept employees from reporting Lord’s violations of children’s safety.
Employees said they had observed violations, including that Lord was alone with children, cared for her privately as a babysitter, let her sit on his shoulder, told one that he loved it, and allowed children to play with his phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose supervisor was Lord and who had asked for a child protection training because she was concerned about his behavior, said that the child service manager Jacqui Barnat, who was the Lords’ supervisor at YMCA Caringbah, was “very intimidating and most of the time was very immediate.”
The CEO stated that he would not accept statements from employees, according to which they would not trust to return their executive report.
Instead, he said, their friendship with the Lord had impaired their ability to judge, so they had not reported it to him.
Hare said he informed the board of the YMCA NSW that the lesson the organization has to draw from the “Jonathan-Lord Intermediate Case” is “not about the reporting” by employees, and the board has agreed to it.
Hare said the decision to force employees to sign secrecy obligations shortly after the allegations were made was made by YMCA’s chief executive of children’s services, Liam Whitley.
He said that this should prevent contamination of the evidence, but that was "excessive" and poorly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not a child-safe organization at the time Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011, said Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, expert on child sexual abuse, the Commission.
He explained that there were “serious problems” with the recruitment, review, incorporation, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing was postponed until 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would take advantage of the opportunity to return as British Prime Minister, but admits that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview this evening on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his resignation, the 59-year-old expressed his views on various domestic policy issues.
Since resigning in June 2007 after a decade as Head of State, Blair has largely avoided expressing his views on British politics, and has mostly restricted his comments to foreign policy and his role as an envoy to the Middle East Peace Quartet.
Asked if he would like to return to the office of Prime Minister, Blair was quoted by Evening Standard London with the words: “Yes, sure, but it’s unlikely that this will happen, so . . .”
When the horse show experts in Sharan met in Cardiff to cure the horse of the year, they were aware that a fierce competition was imminent.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The Knirps, who is not even in kindergarten and has only made his first steps a few months ago, and his Shetland-Pony Toffee slipped through the three rounds and won the first prize – leaving 30 adult opponents behind.
The inseparable couple, both of the same size, were praised for their appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition held by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
When he appeared in competition against men and women with elegant melons, he had set up his dishes in a dirty angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural abilities in dealing with the pony, which are far above his age.
And Toffee was best noted for his appearance and personality.
Fenton had received toffee last March as a gift for his third birthday and has since practiced with the Shetland Pony every day.
His mother, Donna, 30, said, “Fenton and Toffee are a great fit.”
They had to face the entire participant field and left the square with a gold cup and rosette.
It was only the second time he had participated in a competition with Toffee, and we were all excited when he won.
Complete strangers in the arena considered him so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been riding horses for over ten years.
Howells said: “The whole audience was like electrified and everyone fired and stabbed him.”
He ran on sand all the length of the arena and although he looked so small, he did a fantastic job.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens he takes care of.
As he started, it won’t take long for him to be on the “horse of the year” show – and I’m sure he’ll cut off well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show said, “Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony.”
Together they are a great team.
The juries evaluated Fenton and Toffee according to how well they had fought and presented themselves in the lead ring.
They pay attention to good cooperation between Pony and the leader – and Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton's cute clothes helped her part, which really fit perfectly for the occasion.
Chinese newspaper to be ‘reformed’ after call
A Chinese newspaper, which had requested the release of a reporter who had been accused of diffaming, was to be reformed, a press regulator said.
The Guangzhou-based New Express had printed a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribe money to fake reports about a state-owned company.
Now the New Express will be subject to a “wide-spectrum rectification,” the regulatory authority said.
The “Rectification Order” was issued by the Guangdong Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television Authority.
Preliminary investigations revealed that the New Express, which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several inappropriate reports about the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The editorial management of the New Express was unorganized,” the regulatory authority said in a statement.
She said she had decided to impose “an administrative penalty for Chen Yongzhou and deprive him of his reporter license.”
“Yangcheng Evening News Group was instructed to carry out a complete rectification of the New Express and recommended that the relevant managers be identified for the New Express and that the New Express management team be checked immediately.”
Chen had written several articles for the New Express, in which he reported alleged financial irregularities at a construction machinery manufacturer named Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the title page and put himself behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published wrong reports against payment.
“In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and their ability to gain public trust,” he told state news channel CCTV.
I did it primarily because I was out of money and fame.
It became clear to me that I was wrong.
Following Chen’s apology, the New Express published an apology on the title page and stated that it had failed to properly verify the reports.
Several well-known suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say that confessions are still being routinely forced, despite a change in the law earlier this year, in which authorities were forbidden to force someone to blame themselves.
Drug Tunnel Discovered with Own Railroad Between Mexico and the US
One of the most refined tunnels for drug smuggling between the United States and Mexico, which was fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric rail operation, has now been discovered.
U.S. authorities have described the tunnel, measuring 120 times 90 centimeters, as one of the most sophisticated passages they have ever found.
The tunnel, which runs in the zigzag pattern over a length of almost six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
There are countless unprecedented warehouses in the area, making it easier to hide drug-laden trucks.
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported unrecognized, the authorities said.
Eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were secured when the tunnel was discovered, according to the court records.
Three men, who worked as drivers, were charged with possession and intentional sale of marijuana and cocaine, according to authorities.
They will be sentenced to prison sentences of between ten years and life.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of sewage ducts.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage that has been discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, which puts the drug cartels face the challenge of how they can quickly bring their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a nearly 640-meter-long rail passageway that ran from a kitchen in a residential building in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other
Actor Orlando Bloom and model Miranda Kerr want to go separate ways in the future.
In an interview, however, Bloom said that he and Kerr are still in love.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are the parents of the two-year-old Flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom has declared his separation from his wife, top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with U.S. journalist Katie Couric, due to be broadcast on Friday, Bloom said, "life sometimes doesn't go exactly as we plan or hope for."
Kerr and himself still loved each other, the 36-year-old stressed.
"We will support and love each other as Flynn's parents".
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, and in 2011 their son Flynn was born.
Veganism is, according to Lexicon, subject to vegetarianism, but it is very different from it.
Because while vegetarians allow themselves to eat sandwiches, ice cream or a strong edamer, these slimeries are not on the menu of a vegan.
Milk, cheese, eggs, in addition to the abandonment of meat and fish, the vegan leaves off all consumption of animal products - honey is also denied.
What remains, you may wonder, but with a closer look at the vegan diet world is characterized by a considerable intensity.
"Brot stripes are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local reform house, which provides a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the shop in the Domgasse.
For 13 years, the native New Zealander has lived vegan, in Lampertheim he (almost) finds everything he needs to live. "In 1997 I changed my diet and became a vegetarian".
Around the turn of the century, the next step took place and I became a vegan.
"But the conviction came not only because of the diet, but because of the choice of shoes," says Proctor, who prefers normal leather.
He realized that there is no animal products in other everyday interests as well.
Veganism is an ethic.
"I don't want animals to die for me," says Proctor, a vegan maxim that extends to the whole consumption behavior.
Instead of relying on burgers, turkeys or rubber bears, the vegan quickly discovered new products, the enthusiasm increased.
"It's a double bonus," says Proctor today, "in fact, its veganism is not an abandonment, no asceticism, but it's an enrichment." The assumption that with the diet conversion you reduce the choice of food options, Proctor is more likely to return to the power of habit.
And it was precisely these conditionings that made some even more well-meaning attempts fail.
“The addiction factor is a very crucial factor that makes many quicker to give up, similar to when smoking,” says Proctor.
And turn: "Certain tastes are not to be attached to the animal."
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste.
“But you can also produce the same effect in other ways,” explains the vegan.
Proctor brings for example aubergines, mushrooms and some vegan herbs to a barbecue party.
He focuses on a balanced, varied diet, in which it should taste delicious.
Of course you want to have something between your teeth, that’s legitimate.
“It’s supposed to taste, but that’s not just to reduce to animal food,” Proctor says.
Health damage up to eating disorders, another widespread assumption, he has not suffered.
For me, the change had a positive aspect.
I don’t take any foreign cholesterol and have an increased amount of vitamins.
There are high-performance athletes who eat exclusively vegan.
“My blood values are the best, I check myself often,” Proctor says.
In particular, many veganism critics warn of vitamin B12 deficiency.
“Since animals are fed with food instead of grassing on the grass, it is questionable whether the vitamin B12 content is high in the meat you buy in the refrigerator,” says Proctor.
For vegans, there is also the possibility to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
"My B12 values are fine," he explains.
Proctor does not have to go far for food procurement.
After all, basic foods are everywhere and every supermarket now has soy milk and other products.
I find everything I need on site.
From time to time I buy something special.
"Many people overlook that only the finished products are expensive, but so is the case with "ordinary" finished products as well."
Nonetheless, the preparation of vegan dishes is far cheaper and less time-consuming than is generally accepted.
"In the kitchen there is much to discover, with a few small knives one can achieve good if not partially better results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, slightly more baking powder and carbonic acid instead of eggs, with his vegan cheese cakes, Proctor was also able to amaze his siblings.
Family parties give the vegan a new spic.
This has dynamics, if you cook together, it has a new value.
“The situations that can arise in this are as different as people themselves,” says Proctor.
Of course, he was also skeptical.
Don't you like my food anymore?
"Should I feel bad now because I'm drinking milk?" - you have to act like a vegan with a fingertip feeling on such questions.
"I don't reject people, I'm part of this society," Proctor doesn't want to end an enclave.
And more precisely, the everyday world doesn’t seem as vegan as supposedly – and the vegan doesn’t seem as limited in everyday life as commonly assumed.
Fast food is also allowed.
Potatoes are everywhere!
"Many stores offer Falafel, or just a vegetarian yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria, he turns out to pasta dishes, or just order a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.
The restaurants are so slow on it.
“When I started eating vegan 13 years ago, everything was much more difficult,” the New Zealander can find a development: “You have to talk to people, make them aware of it.”
“When enough demand comes, they may be inclined to supplement the menu,” he hopes.
Vegan restaurants evolve, such as the compass in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor wishes that other restaurants also have at least one vegan dish on the menu.
Basically there are vegan dishes for everyone there.
Everyone can eat them, so they are just the opposite of exclusive.
"Meat dishes, on the other hand, are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others," says Proctor.
“If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a safe way to make most of it impossible,” says Proctor.
However, buying vegan products can be a bit difficult at first.
In particular, if one learns to understand that animal additives can also be found in peanuts as a dyeing agent, it seems that by following the ethics in so many hurdles and traps, one quickly leaves the courage.
Not only did Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen write a book: "Veganissimo - Animal Ingredients and Their Alternatives" explains the many ingredients that are used in food but also cleaning products.
"After and after you develop a scanner view and know which signs and logos you have to pay attention to, 'It's sometimes better to take small steps than to stand up or step down,' says Proctor.
Veganism, it is an important moral fingerprint that strikes consciousness.
He may not be able to completely dismiss his habits, but at least he can teach consumers to critically question his habits.
The stock market operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers breathing.
Trading at the Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon of German time.
In a statement, the operator was responsible for technical problems.
The other eleven U.S. option markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The latest incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger pans with the stock market operator.
Only on Tuesday had the Nasdaq indexes not been calculated for an hour due to data transport errors.
In August of this year, there were only two pans in a week.
At first, U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs had sent mass defective purchase orders to the options markets due to technical problems.
After that, the stock market operators took almost a whole day to review and delete the orders.
Two days later, half of all stock trading in the United States came to a standstill due to a computer pan on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange for several hours.
In addition, last year, Facebook’s stock market was on the rise.
The Nasdaq systems had not increased the flow of purchase and sale orders, later established the SEC stock exchange supervisory and fined the company with a record <0x24>10 million fine.
Constance: Radler drives 63-year-old
According to police, the accident occurred when a 26-year-old man on Thursday night, at about 10 p.m., was unintentionally driving a ladies bike on the left side of the train station towards the market place.
When suddenly a 63-year-old man walked from a place on the sidewalk, the cyclist was unable to brake in time, according to police.
At the next collision, the pedestrian was pushed against the house wall, went to the ground in the next course and pulled a square wound about 15 centimeters in the head.
A rescue team brought the wounded to the clinic for medical treatment.
British Police Approves Assange’s Extradition Order
The British police today handed over a extradition warrant to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London and applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard explained that the 40-year-old Australian had been given a "requirement to stand up" that urged him to appear in a police station, adding that if he did not comply, he would be threatened by arrest.
Assange threatens to be extradited to Sweden on charges of sexual offence after his options have been exhausted under British law since the Supreme Court rejected his objection to the extradition earlier this month.
As he feared that Stockholm would hand him over to the United States, he had sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19 and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard “appointed a 40-year-old man to meet at a police station at any time of our choice,” a spokesman said.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on bail.
The embassy did not comment on the submission of the police request.
Assange fears that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States and charged there for possible spying charges after he posted over 250,000 diplomatic messages on WikiLeaks’s disclosure website.
A driver who was left with 210 km/h and a hot drink between his legs gets <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 fine
A driver was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 for driving up to 210 km/h and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree.
After the police stopped him, they found the cup of drink between his legs.
In front of the Colchester District Court, Howie found himself guilty without the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also convicted of paying a cost of <0xC2><0xA3>90 as well as a <0xC2><0xA3>100 sacrifice allowance.
Tax for foreign property owners against London's speculation bubble
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but is still awaiting the final decision of Treasury Chancellor George Osborne, who had imposed a stamp tax of 7% in the 2012 budget on apartments that cost more than two million pounds, as well as holding annual fees as a single person and as the buyers.
Already now, revenue from the stamp tax on housing in the districts of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which stood at 708 million pounds in fiscal year 2012/13, is exceeding revenue for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the Northeast, Northwest, Yorkshire and the Humber region.
Cook said: “After the increases in the stamp tax on high-priced apartments and the introduction of the related legislation against circumventing it, it is difficult to claim that high-quality properties are too low to be taxed, regardless of the impact of the outdated municipal tax system.”
“But this step could make some foreign investors more reluctant when it comes to buying real estate in London, or discouraging owners from selling it,” he added.
First-class real estate – the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price – in the wealthy London Southwest Belt, stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon, have netted a record 11.8% last year.
The prices in Central London showed a steady annual growth of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by an emerging “inland market” where the southwestern part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced an upward trend, according to a survey by Savills.
Scientists were able to shed more light on the connection between a dog’s thighs and his mood.
Previous research has shown that happy dogs with the tail turned more to the right (from the dog’s point of view), while in nervous dogs it was the left side.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and react to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trient, said: “It is well known in humans that the left and right hemispheres of the brain respond differently to stimuli that trigger positive or negative emotions.”
Here we have tried to look at this in other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just like in humans, the right half of the brain is responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the lateral skulls of their species, the researchers monitored the animals while watching these films of other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the four legs and analyzed the behavior.
Probably we will soon understand why the tail moves in one direction, in the other direction.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We showed the dogs movies with dogs – either a natural version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and we were able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or to the right.”
When the animals saw how an otherwise inexpressible dog moved the tail to the right (looking from the dog’s perspective), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the tail tended mainly to the left (again from the perspective of the dog who wrestled), their heart rate increased and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not intentionally communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs would have learned from experience, which movements they should worry about and when not.
He said: “If you have different encounters with other dogs, and walking in a direction with the tail is more associated with friendly behavior and the right side produces less friendly behavior, then you respond on the basis of these experiences.”
The researchers say that the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand their animal’s emotions.
John Bradshaw, an expert on dog behavior and guest scholarship at the University of Bristol’s Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, said this was not the first study to investigate whether left and right are important for dogs.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right when it is a satisfied dog.
Another research at the University of Victoria in Canada stated: “Dogs are more likely to walk on a robot dog if their ‘swan’ is to the left rather than to the right, rather than to become restless – just differently than in an Italian study.”
According to his statement, the differences could be due to the fact that dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the movies or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs respond to real dogs could help, he explained.
“While there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain halves are used for different purposes, many of the details still have to be determined – and dogs are no exception,” Bradshaw said.
But since their behavior is simply recorded, it probably won’t take long until we understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other direction.
Arctic Monkeys postpone performance in Glasgow due to Alex Turners' illness
The rock band Arctic Monkeys has postponed a performance in Glasgow after her lead singer is ill with constipation.
The band from Sheffield is scheduled to play in the hydro on Friday.
However, due to the illness of lead singer Alex Turner, the concert must now be postponed.
The announcement came after she had previously had to postpone a performance at LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: “After deciding to cancel the show at LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and on medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also cancel the show at the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, November 1.
“Alex Turner has been diagnosed with constipation, which is why it can’t occur.”
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will now take place on November 20, which was moved to November 21 at the Hydro in Glasgow.
All tickets are valid for these shows.
We apologize to all ticket holders for the inconvenience caused by this.

Pope Francis appoints first cardinal in February
Pope Francis will be convening new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest-ranking clergymen in the Catholic Church after the Pope, and they are also the ones who elect a pope, so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 can no longer participate in the pope’s election – this is the case for a group of 120 “elected cardinals”.
In a statement announcing the message, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said there would be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony for the appointment of the new cardinals, also known as the Consistory, was held.
“Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the Consistory in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from around the world can be planned,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinals eligible to vote would likely fall by February.
He explained that a pope would normally appoint as many cardinals as necessary so that the number of eligible cardinals would be 120 again, and as many cardinals over 80 as he would like.
The Consistory next year is important because it is the first since the election of Francis in March of this year, Valero said.
Currently, there is a certain overlap in Europe and in Italy in particular.
“It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance,” he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a small number of cardinals.
The Cardinals will also be the first to be called upon since the formation of the Council of Cardinals established by Francis to find a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who are tasked with finding ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
“Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He explained that it was “good possible” for Francis to ask the cardinals for advice.
But we weren’t in that position until now – that’s all new.
Valero said that the bishops would typically be called cardinals from large places, but Francis is “full of surprises – so we don’t know who he appoints.”
GM recalls new pickup trucks in the U.S. to repair seat restraints
General Motors is recalling nearly 19,000 of its all-new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks in 2014 to fix a problem with the manually adjustable seat restraint, the U.S. vehicle safety regulator said on Friday.
In some of the cars, there may be a defect in the mechanism for replacing the front seat.
For this reason, they do not comply with the federal guidelines on vehicle safety in head restraints.
“When mounted from the rear of the vehicle, it is possible that the headrest does not properly protect the passengers, so there is an increased risk of injury,” the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said in a statement.
The recalled models were produced between August 1st and September 10th.
Delivery of the GM trucks began in June and represents the most important model launch of the leading U.S. automaker since the insolvency-related restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the vehicle owners in the first half of October about the defect.
The NHTSA was unable to review the notification letter due to the 16-day government shutdown, which had a negative impact on car sales in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were redeveloped for the 2014 model year, increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42.660 Silverado and 16.503 Sierra pickup trucks.
The GM stock on the New York Stock Exchange rose by 1.4 percent to <0x24>37.47 on Friday afternoon.
Desperation of an Obama voter
I have voted for President Obama twice in the hope that change will be possible.
He says Obama has made commendable efforts that have been frustrated by Republicans’ blockade tactics.
The blockade policy does not excuse Obamacare’s website problems, the drone attacks
Obama’s memoirs about the 2008 election campaign were a sad reminder of what would have been possible.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am currently reading a very sad book.
It’s a book that I thought would warm me up during the dull second year of my medical studies and give me hope again.
It is called “The Audacity to Win” and depicts Barack Obama’s memoirs of the 2008 presidential election.
When I finish my patient records in the evening and go to bed, then the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and could steal the breath of a speech.
The election was a landslide victory and news speakers were held in order to bear in mind the historical significance of this hour.
My classmates cried for joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on their way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama moved to office in 2008, he had an approval rate of 82%.
And then I close the book.
Switching back to the present is a bad awakening, as if you are being ripped out of a dream.
It’s hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague reminder, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I voted for the first time, something has actually changed.
But it's just nothing I could have imagined.
I recognize the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act on Health Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced silence of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I also believe that the political blockade tactics of the party have been too many efforts to bring our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance, and the closure of Guantanamo Bay, to name a few.
But after defending the Obama administration against colleagues and acquaintances countless times, I came to the end with my attempts to explain.
I have reached a point of political despair.
The Republican blockade policy cannot explain why it is allowed to interrogate foreign heads of state or kill innocent children by drones overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data about the privacy of Americans and why whistleblowers are being penalized for revealing state misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen, was murdered without prosecution, nor why the public funding and spending limits were circumvented during the presidential election.
It does not justify the results of a report that says the White House’s efforts to calm the media are “the most aggressive ... since the Nixon government.”
And most recently, it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if that's what I should have expected.
I wish I had understood at the age of 18 that the work of the government could contradict the previous political campaigns.
Obviously, the MP is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and incidental events such as the Newtown massacre shape public discussion.
But if I look at the above examples, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.
And that bothers me the most.
I re-elected Obama in 2012, not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and unexplored alternative, he did not seem to be able to determine his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hope we had heard of for so long.
However, as Obama’s approval values fell to less than 45% this week, the return to 2008 by this book has become so much harder.
It awakens in me the desire for the many promises that have dissolved in the air.
This week, I read a section in the book that describes how Obama had to inject a heavy loss against Clinton in the Pennsylvania election.
In a meeting with the electorate after the decision, he told his employees that they should come back to class and follow the purpose of their case.
“I want us to find our magic again,” he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree more strongly with you.
The views expressed in this comment are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer Says Prime Minister Tony Abbott Has Conflicts of Interest During Parental Holidays
Billionaire and MP Clive Palmer said Prime Minister Tony Abbott was in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughters would become pregnant and could benefit from it.
The mining magnat, who is in a court dispute over paying <0x24>6 million in CO2 tax, raised the claim when he wanted to clear questions from the table about whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for deciding whether to abolish or cut taxes on CO2 and mining.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and Abbott’s daughters would personally benefit from the laws.
“He’s in a big conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because when one of his daughters gets pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not she gets a vacation,” Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Palmer Election Commission officially declared the winner of Fairfax’s Sunshine Coast seat with 53 votes in the lead after the recount.
Palmer called for a revision of the vote counting process so that it can be counted faster.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why shouldn't we have a system where you go in, enter the data into a computer, pick it right away, and then at 6:30 p.m. the result?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking the ballot.
Do you use them because you can then radiate the results if you don’t like them?
Nowadays, matching with pencils is unbelievable.
The Election Commission has reviewed the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint bill with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, said his policy included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new office "very seriously".
In a public office, it is the service to the public.
“We seek no reward but that of history, namely that we can serve this community in a critical time,” he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its currency division, so two people familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the worldwide government investigation into the alleged manipulations in the currency market is rapidly taking place.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with the authorities in the investigations into the world’s largest financial market, where <0x24>5.3 trillion per day are switching owners.
The two merchants would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the expanding investigation that follows the scandal over the Libor interbank business.
The bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received information requests from authorities.
“Our investigations on this issue continue and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators,” the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the situation said that the RBS had forwarded the records of emails and instant messages sent from and to a former dealer to the UK supervisory authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, had left the RBS in 2010 and is now said to have been granted permission from his current position as European head of Forex spot trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European Spot Trading at Citi, was allowed this week, and Matt Gardiner, former chief currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended at Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged with any misconduct.
Bankers at Barclays and the Citigroup were part of Usher’s Instant Message Group, people close to the situation said.
UBS announced this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating a suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market at a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities around the world – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with allegations that bankers have agreed to deal with foreign exchange transactions.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received information requests from authorities, people familiar with the situation said.
Banks have been hacking instant messages and emails from several years in search of cases of misconduct.
The news of these investigations has put traders in turmoil in an area that has been one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks in recent years, but this year was under pressure because low volatility in currencies limits the chances for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair and said it is almost impossible to manipulate the expanded and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders believe this is not necessarily true.
A leading trader noted that despite the huge daily volume of foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of their own internal platforms by banks led to the fact that “you can influence the market with very low ticket prices”.
The news came out the same day that Credit Suisse announced it had cancelled a dealer at its London Exchange Traded Funds office this week after it had caused a loss of nearly <0x24>6 million late last year.
The bank immediately informed the competent authorities and cooperated with them.
“We are sure that the dealer has traded alone and that the matter has been blocked,” Credit Suisse said.
The Bauzaun painted on the Bechtle plot
A group of the citizens' initiative "Swiss Meadow" has embellished the Bauzaun on the Bechtle plot on the Kurpromenade in Bad Herrenalb.
In addition, she cleaned and spread the path, it is said in a press release.
The planned coverage of the decaying house in the rear of the property was not allowed for safety reasons, as the site is threatened with slippage.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had agreed to the decoration action with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI.
Before the action of the BI, a transparent message with the message "We are for it" had been attached.
However, this did not interfere with the actions of some 20 members of the Citizens’ Initiative.
Their motto on the big poster was "We are against building blocks".
With this, she wanted to point out the danger of even greater ruins on the Swiss meadow - if the giant project fails one day.
In conversations with many passers-by before the "building site", it became clear that some citizens believed that the realization of the city project would be much better, although not a few have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI.
But they are beginning to resign because the city is further delaying these responses, it is said from the BI side.
As you may have heard, the mayor’s public statements also have an impact.
May had said at the municipal council meeting that he feared the outlet for the thermal bath should the population vote against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow.
Some seem frightened for this reason, others feel that they are "a plunging attempt to blackmail" the population, the BI press release continues.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers.
Rangnick shells for Schiris: Mane no Schwalben King
So satisfied Ralf Rangnick is with the current high form of Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg, so disappointed the sports director of the "bulls" by the referees.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the category of Schwalbenkönigs," he said at a press conference in Salzburg on Thursday.
The youngest occasion for Rangnick’s criticism was yellow for Mane at 3:0 against Grödig last Sunday, in which the Senegalese reader became an alleged playoff - which was obviously not as TV images showed.
"A sharp misdeed," said Rangnick, who referred to arbitrator Harkam as "completely overlooked".
Harkam had also contributed "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig coach Adi Hütter after the match.
He decisively defended his German landsman: "I would have behaved like Roger Schmidt in every single situation."
Schmidt himself did not want to have any contact with his colleague after the shawl.
I don't know why.
"Because I'm the one who was offended," the 46-year-old said.
In view of the success, however, Rangnick voted for a hymn of praise.
"There are only two words for that: Very good," he said.
There's not much to postpone.
Above all, the way the team plays is impressive.
That's how it's supposed to go.
There will hardly be changes in the frame during the winter transfer period.
There are no great reasons to change something.
"Unless a player comes up with the wish that he wants to leave the club," said Rangnick.
Supreme Court Approves Obama's Health Act
It is a big victory for the Obama administration: the U.S. Supreme Court today ruled that the health law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional.
With five to four votes, the judges ruled that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – which compels U.S. citizens to complete health insurance or pay a fine by 2014 – is constitutional under the state’s tax authority.
Supreme Judge John Roberts took the side of the four more liberal members of the House, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy ruled against it.
The court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2,700-page law and also represented the view, the prerequisite of the Health Act, that states should either extend the access requirements for Medicaid or otherwise would not endanger all state medicaid funding.
The lawsuit was filed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was decisively rejected by all leading Republican presidential candidates, including the ultimate challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 election campaign.
Norway: Norway’s place is lit with giant mirrors
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light into its dark valley.
Due to the low degree of sunshine, the Rjukan in the Vestfjord Valley usually sinks in the shade of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring.
With three giant reflectors at 45 meters in height, a century-long dream came true on Wednesday.
"Finally!" said Mayor Steinar Bergsland at the start ceremony on TV2.
Some valley residents stood up in front of sunbeds, others wearing sunglasses for safety.
Until now, sun-hungry people had to ride a cable car to a nearby summit in winter.
Ten years ago, local artist Martin Andersen had presented the proposal to direct the rays with mirrors into the valley.
But this basic idea has been in place since 1913.
After several years of debate, the city council had finally adopted the costly project of 5 million kronor (around 615,000 euros).
A similar design has been providing winter sunshine to the Italian resort of Viganella for a few years.
The post doesn't last until Sunday
"Many citizens will not have noticed it yet, the red dots for the Sunday emptying are still located at various mailboxes of the city and the districts, but you can read the small prints on the yellow containers of Post AG, you can quickly find that the emptying at the sun and holidays is no longer possible,"
A request from the FDP has confirmed this.
On Sundays and holidays only before the post office building on Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld will be empty.
Whether in Hofheim and Rosengarten is still empty on Sunday, the answer to the FDP’s request will not be answered.
The social and youth policy spokesman of the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to go back here.
The Sunday emptying is an important post service right at appointment mail.
"This thinns this undertaking radically and inadmissibly despite rising prices for letters in January 2013".
Thomas Bittner, chairman of the Liberal Group and City Association, supports his group colleagues: "What bothers me is the fact that the vacancy periods here are secretly altered or even deleted."
The post office is a mile away from the public.
"At least the mailboxes in the districts of Neuschloss and Rosengarten must be emptied again on Sunday," said Bittner and Rohrenbeck unisono.
Also for the core city, especially non-mobile citizens should be able to reach a mailbox with Sunday emptying on foot.
Röhrenbeck asked the city parliament whether the city administration was planning talks with the post about this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post had not communicated with Lampertheim.
However, there is also a Sunday leak in Hofheim.
His party has voted for privatization.
"Then decisions will be made elsewhere," Maier said.
Frankfurt car park fees are expected to rise sharply
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become more sensitively expensive.
The city’s magistrate is advising this morning on a presentation by traffic manager Stefan Majer (Green).
Parking fees are expected to be increased by 50 percent.
But not to raise prices, but to reduce the time interval of parking hours and parking ticket machines from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, the House of Representatives will have to decide.
The Retail Committee of the IHK Frankfurt considers it "not a good idea".
The parking facility right in front of the store is "an undeniable advantage for smaller retailers".
The Transport Club Germany believes that an increase after two decades is "reasonable and indeed long overdue".
Public transport is also becoming more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Quick Actions Overwrite Hosts
With a narrow frame, the Herren I of the TSV Freudenstadt in the Schiller-Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen had to face the TG Gönningen from the Schwäbischen Alb.
The seniors were with an experienced team on the other side of the net.
Soon, however, it turned out that they could not fully cope, even with age-related, with the rapid actions of the cities of joy.
With the hard and positioned lifts, the gönnings became extremely difficult.
Repeatedly they missed the passports and attacks handed down by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz over the network and were not present in the blockade.
Two high first set wins clearly expressed the superiority of the joy cities in all interests.
In the face of this overwhelming and play-determining performance, the third set was won somewhat lazy and unlucky to the 3:0 final (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
There will be a much more powerful opponent on the field on November 2, with the TV Baiersbronn, which was able to clearly implement in Nagold.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bauernle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-Class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt faced in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a hard-hit two-hour match.
Nervosity on both sides caused mainly errors and points to take; even in the passports the precision was sometimes flawed and in some critical play scenes the override prevented the look for possible points gains.
In this highly balanced meeting, however, Marcus Blasutto’s TSV team agreed with the great physical effort and happy commitment of both teams.
Care day at the small English hut
In the meantime, for the fifth day of care following the Natura 2000 project, a group of dedicated participants met at the small English hut in Ibach.
On the basis of suggestions from the population, it should be released to the valley in the area of the Cottage of the View, said Mayor Helmut Kaiser.
Many hikers, Kaiser said, described this area as the shiny part of the Glacier, where the landscape offers the ideal setting for stunning views.
He thanked the attendees for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the nursing day is a suitable instrument to strengthen the connection of man and nature.
It offers every citizen the opportunity to put accents in nature itself.
At the same time as the tourist aspect, ecological consideration can also be found.
This ecological aspect was explained by Friederike Tribukait from the Department of Nature Conservation of the Government Presidency of Freiburg following the welcome by Landrat Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the shield and wished the action a good success.
According to Tribukait, the tourist goal of the panoramic view is to preserve the now highly grown old panoramic field with its specific protected habitats by opening and connecting to the existing meadows.
Certain species such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas.
You need these free connections for species conservation.
Tribukit said she did not want to miss it at this point to break a lance for the planned biosphere area.
Not only does the current measure fit seamlessly into this plan.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and ecological development on the basis of the internationally recognized UNESCO status and thus a continuous complement to the Life project and the previous nursing days for the future.
Following these various presentations, Revierleiter Christoph Wehle and Life Project Manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had already been beaten in advance, the forest tractor is ready to pick up if necessary.
A group of helpers should take care of the release of wax buckets and the maintenance of a dry stone brick.
The goal was the free view at the point of view.
Löppeningen: Heads still a single candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the town of Baar Löffingen, with its 7,514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a forward-looking school, children, youth and seniority policy, as well as its own urban structures, has not yet been named as an attractive city, no second mayoral candidate has registered.
As the only candidate for the succession of mayor Norbert Brugger, who is no longer a candidate for age reasons, the 46-year-old banker and businessman Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen has been identified so far.
The application deadline expires on Monday, 11 November, at 6 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei sued for Nortel patent
The group, which owns thousands of previous Nortel patents, tightened a string of lawsuits on Thursday for patent infringement against mobile manufacturers, including Google, the company that was overrun by Nortel in its insolvency spree.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought the North patents for <0x24>4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringements before the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is being investigated in seven cases of patent infringement.
The patents are technology that matches search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, so the lawsuit thus hits the core of Google’s search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not directly accessible.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making phones that work with Google’s Android operating system, which is in fierce competition with Apple and Microsoft’s mobile products.
In 2011, Google issued an initial order of over <0x24>900 million for Nortel patents.
Google has increased its offer several times and last offered <0x24>4.4 billion.
After being overburdened with Rockstar’s Nord patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for <0x24>12.5 billion, a business that was also partly motivated by Motorola’s patent library.
“While Google failed to acquire the patents at the auction, Google has infringed the patents and continues to do so,” the letter said.
Rockstar is demanding a high compensation from Google as it claims Google's patent infringement is intentional, the prosecution said.
Egypt sworn in first free-elected president
Mohamed Mursi is retiring from office, but his day of triumph is not likely to mean an end to political disputes in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a “new Egypt” when he was sworn in as the country’s first freely elected president and thus became the successor of Husni Mubarak, who had been expelled from office 16 months earlier.
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamic president of the Arab world and Egypt's fifth head of state since the fall of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He sworn in front of the 18 judges dressed in black robes of the court, which has its seat on the Nile and is reminiscent of an ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are striving for a better future, a new Egypt and a second Republic,” Mursi said at the ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.
“Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said the 60-year-old Morsi, an engineer trained in the United States and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that had been in the organization since its founding as a genomenist for 84 years.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when Mursi arrived in a small convoy shortly after 11am local time.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in front of the court to applaud the new president, and unlike the presidential prunk from the Mubarak era, traffic was only stopped briefly so that the car convoy could connect the usually busy street to the city centre, crossing the city’s bustle.
As an uncharismatic “replacement wheel” of the fraternity, his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech in which he presented himself not only as a candidate of the Islamists, but all of those who bring uprising efforts from 2011 against the authoritarian Mubarak to Ziel.
“Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” Mursi, dressed in a blue suit with a red tie, told the judges in the wooden-plated chamber where he held office.
Later, Mursi went to Cairo University, where he was supposed to give his speech.
He was officially greeted by an army chapel playing the national anthem he listened to in Habakkuk.
Military leader Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by hundreds of attendees in the university’s largest auditorium with choirs of “The Army and the People Are One Hand”.
Founded in 1908 as a base for secular education, the University of Cairo has evolved into a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
On Friday, Mursi took a symbolic oath at Tahir Square, the birthplace of the uprising that led to the end of Mubarak’s authoritarian rule last year, and vowed to reclaim the presidential powers that the military council had overtaken from the head of state, who was expelled from office.
But by putting the official oath before the court, and not as usual before Parliament, he clings to the will of the military, indicating that the power struggle will continue.
Mursi’s speech on Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberger Discothek provides two great evenings
The new season at the Falkenberger discotheque "Blue Velvet" has begun.
On this Friday evening it is called "Pump this party", on tomorrow Saturday evening it is going on with a <0xC3><0x9C> 25 party.
Fat beats and cool sounds are of course promised by the organizers on both days.
Worker crashed from manager: severely injured
A 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg fell from a manager on Thursday when he replaced a defective outsider and was seriously injured.
The man from Lamprechthausen wanted to replace a defective heating sensor on the outside facade of a guesthouse.
As he climbed onto the lead facing the roof, it slipped away and the man crashed onto the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to Salzburg State Hospital with the rescue helicopter "Christophorus 6".
Rape in South Africa: Twice-Life Arrest
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced to life imprisonment twice on Friday.
This was reported by SABC.
The victim was later killed as a result of serious injuries.
Johannes Kana had already been found guilty at the beginning of the week of the crime.
The incident had sparked panic nationwide.
The then 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February in an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
For 14 hours, the doctors fought for the survival of the victim, but in vain.
The young people’s eyes were so dreadful that nurses and sisters needed psychological help.
Kana had admitted to having been in a bar with Booysen during the process.
He also confessed to having beaten and raped them, but he contended to be responsible for the girl's death.
The police initially came from several perpetrators, but released two suspects from jail because the evidence against them was insufficient.
The prosecutor also stressed during the trial that she was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
In South Africa, rape is almost a daily occurrence: there are about 64,000 sexual violence ads every year.
That’s almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people, it has significantly more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women’s associations in South Africa estimate the number of sexual violence to 10- to 25-fold.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest ham
Jumbo looking for the "best ham in the world": For the TV show "Galileo" the Pro7 star visited Bonndorf.
The speaker makes it clear from the start: the most important thing for the ham are the pork boilers, turbomast is not a good prerequisite.
Can ham, which you get in every supermarket, be a quality product?
As head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest, Jumbo explains the workings of the company "Adler" in Bonndorf.
"Germany's favorite ham", as Jumbo announces the Black Forest ham.
Only with hair protection and kittel he comes into the factory.
Also, Jumbo must first disinfect his hands before he can reach the micro.
Jumbo seen to strengthen at quick whistle in Waldshut
"Here I'm working in huge quantities," the TV maker, Black Forest ham as a mass product, marveled.
16,000 Colognes speak for themselves each week.
Weight, fat content, color: Uli explains what quality is all about.
Most pigs are slaughtered at the age of six months.
TV with a level?
Also details such as the Ph-value of the meat play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the pH value.
"I'm excited when you measure Roberto Blanco, what happens then," Jumbo said cynically.
Here the level of private television is presented in pure culture.
But it’s still worth watching.
The viewer sees that the dismantling of the Columns continues to be handcrafted.
Because: Black Forest ham is traditionally found without bones in the shelf.
The secret of ham is the mixture of spices with salt.
Smoke tower and smoke firing visually remind Jumbo of a "submarine".
The trick: thin branches here in the smoke ensure the special taste of black forest ham.
After 20 days of smoke, the ham is almost black.
"Now the disc in the Jumbo disappears," he announces the test feed.
"It's really delicious," concludes the TV star.
This will allow all those involved to live.
Did you think travel agencies belong to the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to be in opposition to the trend.
The company has increased its profit outlook for the entire year and expects record revenue from vacationers in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now expects a net annual profit before taxes of between <0x24>325 and <0x24>340 million, compared to <0x24>305 to <0x24>315 million in its previous forecast.
If the current targets are reached, that means a growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to a record earning of <0x24>290.4 million in the 2011/12 period.
As CEO Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre achieved eight percent profits in the first half of the year and booked a strong start in the second half, especially in the Australian and British private business.
“Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have been profitable and some of them are on a good track towards record year revenues before interest and taxes,” he said.
These include Australia and the United Kingdom, which are typically among our strongest earners.
In Australia, the leisure industry has recovered in the second half of the year, providing a slightly weaker business travel market.
Similarly, it worked well for Flight Centre’s leisure business in the UK, while business customers spent less on it.
U.S. business recovered from the seasonally weakened first half year, so for the third consecutive year a profit is expected for the entire year.
Flight Centre’s shares rose by 3 cents to <0x24>38.20 yesterday.
Schools are held to a greater focus on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In English literature courses, students will have to deal with at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, romantic lyrics, and contemporary British novels from 1914.
The exam also finds “unseen texts” input to encourage further reading.
The combined course of English literature and language will be abolished.
Starting in 2015, students will have to pass an independent GCSE exam for language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish tomorrow the new curricula for English and Mathematics – the first subjects radically redesigned.
Other core areas will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the supervisory authority for examinations, will announce a reorganization of the GCSE structures, including a new rating system and less coursework.
In a speech this summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said that there is “a broad consensus that we need to reform our testing system to restore public trust,” stressing that the GCSEs would become “challenging, ambitious and stricter.”
Studies show that in English schools less time is spent on mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week per school year – than in most other countries.
On the other hand, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours per year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
While there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the schedule, it is from coalition circles that the comprehensive mathematical examination – combined with a stronger weighting of the subject in the rankings – will probably encourage schools to spend more hours.
The curriculum focuses more on “problems from real life”, including financial mathematics.
Attracting beautiful animals and delicious cakes
The most beautiful rabbits of different races and colors presents the Circle Association performance show this weekend in the House of Commons.
Evaluations have already been made on Thursday
Once again, the local association W514 organizes this large exhibition.
The breeders of the associations in the district of Soest show their best animals here as well as young Wicked hobbyists their rabbits.
On Thursday, six awardees took the assessment of the numerous rabbits and were able to distinguish outstanding animals.
Visitors to the show are best informed, as the assessment of all animals is attached to the cages.
The official opening of the exhibition will take place by Mayor Hermann Arndt on Saturday at 2.30 p.m.
The rabbit show is open to all visitors on Saturday from 10 a.m. and on Sunday from 10 a.m. to 15.30 p.m., which will be followed by the award ceremony.
Guests are also invited to a locally priced Tombola and a deliciously furnished cafeteria.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Dialogue Forum
At the next Ecumenical Dialogue Forum on Monday, October 21, at the New Museum of the Castle, the theme is "To Hell with Hell - Theological Considerations for Today's Dealing with the Last Things".
The rapporteur is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Dialogue Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and evangelical churches of Salem, the Salem Castle and the Landseekreis Cultural Office.
Johanna Rahner wants to look at how people today classify the “last things” after death.
If the people of the past centuries had been too aware of this and relied on the images of heaven and hell, "that have shaped our conceptions to this day," then the contemporary prophetic teaching is characterized by the hopes of fulfillment rather by a certain embarrassment or even speechlessness.
“The greater hope has been driven out by the religious criticism of Christians,” she says.
She said: "It has provided us with so many question marks that we seem to have lost the spelling marks."
Johanna Rahner continues: "But the decisive challenge remains the annoyance of death."
This is associated with the question of that desire, "that dreams that in the end everything will be good".
Johanna Rahner, born 1962 in Baden-Baden, studied Catholic theology and biology at the Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
In 1997, she was promoted to Dr. Theol., also in Freiburg.
The habilitation for Fundamental Theology and Ecumenical Theology followed in 2003 at Westphalian Wilhelms University.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has held a chair for Systematic Theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from Kleine Heuberg confirm their faith in the firming
In two religious services, 101 15- and 16-year-olds of the psychiatric unit Am Kleinen Heuberg have been signed.
The morning was accompanied by the Laudato-Si group, the afternoon of the Youth Choir The Spirit.
With the reception of the firm sacrament, the young people said yes to their baptism and embraced the power of the Holy Spirit.
In the past few months, the firms had prepared themselves for the great feast day, under the leadership of the deacon Reiner Dehner and with the help of numerous members of the community.
In various projects, they learned about various tasks of the Christian community and experienced together the Youth Day in Untermachtal.
Illmensee: Second mountain bike race enthusiasms participants
In wonderful weather, 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to take the round course across the hill chains around the lake.
This is reported by Ulrich Knobel from the organising sports association Illmensee.
Among the participants, especially at a short distance of over 15 kilometres and 300 metres above sea level, were also numerous cyclists who once wanted to practice their hobby in a competitive atmosphere.
Two German top-class junior drivers were also at the start in this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation of good standings at the German championships.
The two of them were able to move out of the field as expected.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a small lead to the goal and defended his title as the overall winner of the short distance.
Pascal Treubel was able to take second place again.
Theresa Duelli, from the nightmare team, made it to the top of the ladder.
In second and third place, Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie Driver from Owingen.
A satisfactory development is the increasing number of drivers living or working in the community.
Not only in terms of performance, the entire bandwidth was represented by athletes.
The age structure also ranged from ten years among the youngest to over 70 years among the oldest starters.
In the main race, even more absolute top athletes were at the start this year.
Four drivers were able to take off from the regional top drivers.
Among them Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike semi-professor from the Black-Tusk racing team.
Pangerl, together with a teammate, was twice world champion in twelve-hour driving.
This year he became a European champion in this special discipline.
Roland Ballerstedt, who has already won two German titles in duathlon.
After 45 kilometres and 900 meters of altitude, there was an eye-catching final in the target run in front of the Three Lakes Hall.
Pangerl was the first to cross the finish line.
Just a second after that, Routinier Ballerstedt was able to secure the second place in the overall score.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann were the third of the overall score.
Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest in the main race.
The second place was secured by Arenane Blersch from Binzwangen ahead of Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Athletes and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well-organized course of the event.
On the way through mud, rivers and jungle for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical help to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients.
There are not many doctors in the West African country, only one for 5,000 people.
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is among the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the top 10 to choose him as “CNN Hero of the Year”.
The winner will receive <0x24>250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father repeatedly lose consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon, in 1981.
At first, he only had a broken arm, but then an inflammation was formed that spread to his brain and caused a hematoma that would affect him for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
“It’s not easy,” Bwell commented.
You can leave the house at five in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, but it’s not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has barely changed since Bwell's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor per 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
In contrast, the ratio in the United States is to a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there was a doctor for them, most Cameroons could not afford to visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three-quarters of the country’s health spending is private.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” says Bwelle.
Poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
To see his father and so many of his compatriots suffer, Bwelle made the decision to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team have conducted 700 free operations over the past year.
He himself became a doctor and worked as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
In addition, he founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels on weekends in rural areas and offers free medical care there.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people force themselves into small buses and drive on the roof over unfinished terrain to the villages in need of help.
Not all things go smoothly.
More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will be received like heroes: a party, singing and dancing and the best accommodation that the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and bells – with its wide smile and unlimited energy – are happy to attend the joyful celebration.
The next morning, the team starts investigating hundreds of patients.
“We treat 500 people per ride,” says Bwelle.
They come from a circle of 60 kilometers around the village – and that’s on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others get wrinkles, donated glasses or free birth certificates – a document that is needed for school, but many poor families simply can’t afford it.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local anaesthesia.
Surgery usually takes place in a school, town hall, or apartment; after the operation, patients stand up and go to the recovery area to make room for the next.
The lighting for the OP and disinfection equipment is fed by the group’s generator, so Bwelle and his volunteers work until early morning hours on Sunday.
It’s an energetic curriculum, but village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
“They drum all night so we can stay awake and continue our work,” says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team returns to the city, tired but proud of the work done.
The group – a mix of Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students – has conducted 700 free surgeries last year and knows that with its work it makes a huge difference for the people it helps.
A man explained that the free operation of a larynx he had received now allowed him to work again.
“It changes the future of my family,” said the man.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job he finances 60% of his non-profit activity, says Bwelle; the rest comes from private donations.
“I really don’t know when he’s sleeping,” says Katie O’Malley, who studied medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia for the second year and volunteered to work in Bwell’s group.
He is always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that he can go on these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley who come from the US and Europe and support Bwell, this is a chance to gain practical experiences that they would never get at home.
“We can be involved in surgery where we help to pump blood or hold the instruments for Dr. Bwelle,” O’Malley explains.
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
Students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon themselves and often bring donated sanitary supplies.
But once they are in Yaoundé, Bwelle will take over the accommodation, transportation and instructions.
“He’s definitely a hero,” O’Malley says.
He dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people knows no limits.
For Bwell, almost constant work is not a burden.
Helping others to live a happier life and thus fulfilling a promise he made to his father is a great joy.
“I’m so happy when I do this job,” Bwelle says.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to make people laugh again and to alleviate the pain.

Excellently mastered the fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novel "The Old Man and the Sea", is carved to the body by Horst Janson.
Janson himself is an old rabbit in his art of acting.
The old man Santiago can't do anything about fishing.
So the two just complement each other great.
It is almost thought to be able to see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man, of whom the young fisherman Manolo speaks.
If Santiago is tired of life bent on the chair, that’s real with Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson excels.
Hemingway tells the story of a fighter, a brave man who does not give up and ultimately wins the fight against the fish through his knowledge and willpower.
Janson is on stage as a solo performer on a wide range of tracks.
He manages to focus the attention of the audience on himself, so that his monologues are not boring for a moment.
His efforts to finally draw the fish to the surface of the water are so real that viewers forget that the sea is made up of only blue-lit water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in the boat in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he highlights the active scene: The Cottage of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst, which sings with her songs and her magnificent voice the feeling of life of Cuba.
The four musicians play the Cuban rhythm as well as are guests of the bar.
Tourism: Descent to the Romans
A sewage duct from Roman times is preserved below Cologne, about 120 meters long.
Anyone who visits Cologne will not pass the Cathedral.
The two towers rise to the sky about 157 meters and make it the second tallest church building in Europe.
But few visitors who admire the two filigree church towers think that there is a lot to discover under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in matters of Cologne Underworld.
Meeting point for its guided tours is the service center of Cologne-Tourism directly at the Dom.
The tour starts quite unspectacular: “We start in the underground garage,” says Schulze.
In the 1970s, the city fathers wanted a car town, and therefore only what was not too large was left of the remnants of the old city walls.
Therefore, most users of the parking lot are also in a hurry to pass the Roman remnants today and only drop off their car.
But if you look more closely, you will discover an archaeological site separated by metal grid bars in the park deck D2.
You can see some five-metre-high ruins made of handkerchief-sized stones.
“These are remains of the Roman city walls built in the second half of the first century BC,” says Schulze.
Before it returns to daylight, Schulze lets the participants take a look at the upper level of the park in a dark, 15-metre-deep shaft.
This is the fountain of the old dome, which unfortunately is hardly perceived.
The next stop of the tour is the Pretorium, and here the participants go down to the depths again.
Here we experience the office of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the predecessor of the CCAA.
What CCAA means, a visitor wants to know.
"The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium", which in German means as much as "City of Roman law and City of the Agrippinians, founded under Emperor Claudius at the site of the altar for the Imperial cult"".
And the Pretorium is the former citadel palace, the center of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the premises of the exhibition, a tunnel access leads to the Roman sewage canal, which is here preserved at about 120 meters in length.
"You can quietly escape a piece along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want," Schulze encourages the guests.
There is still a surprise for Schulze.
After picking up the keys at the box, he leads the group to a 16-metre-deep, walkable shaft.
"We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath," he explains.
The Jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to get to the groundwater, which was indispensable for ritual washings.
To this day, at the lower end of the Mikwe, whose origins date back to the eighth century, different water levels can be read by varying levels of the Rhine.
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone on the town hall square, for which construction work is to begin soon.
However, it will take a few years to complete.
Almost hacked leg: re-release of rocker process
A bloody attack in rock'n'rolling environment is being reopened after more than four years.
A trial for attempted homicide, dangerous bodily injury and injury against two 30-year-olds has begun before the Landgericht Frankfurt (Oder).
It is accompanied by strict security measures.
The defendants were silent about the attack.
They were supposed to have been active in the rocker scene and were part of the bandidos at the time.
In June 2009, the prosecutor’s office accused them of instigating three men in a car along with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt.
All the victims were severely injured, a man almost lost his leg.
The victims are said to have belonged to the competing group Hells Angels.
One is said to have been a high-ranking member from Berlin.
It was apparently preceded by a chase with several cars.
According to the prosecution, it was about rebirth fights and a power demonstration.
The two defendants were released in a first trial in early 2012.
A spokesman at the time said it could not be proved that the men were actually involved in the bloody hostility.
The perpetrators were wearing masks and had not been identified.
The Federal Court of Justice suspended the judgment following a review by the prosecutor’s office and referred it to the county court for re-negotiation.
One of the accused is currently in open custody for another crime.
The start was mainly about the reconstruction of the courses in the actual night.
As a witness, the investigating commissioner was charged.
In the center were cell phone calls from the accused and other people who had been interrogated by the police.
It’s hard for rockers to almost always stick to a law for them – and not to declare it.
This also applies to the victims.
In the first trial, only one of the victims had been unpacked.
Prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the Frankfurt State Prosecutor’s Office (Oder) said on demand that new traces have emerged since the last procedure.
Eleven more days of negotiation have been set for the trial.
The Disposable Society Doesn't Think
The night was long, the music loud and the mood good, but at some point it goes home.
Only: In the buns of the people on the passenger and rear seat, hunger becomes noticeable.
Of course, one or the other cocktail or sect may be responsible for it!
What’s closer to driving to the next drive-in to give yourself a little?
I admit, I like to be with you when it comes to fast food hoes late at night or early in the morning.
A couple of apples, a cola, a burger - and then nothing like from home and to bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other starving disco gangsters become noticeable.
What must be missing if you regularly throw your fast food bags out the car window?!
Particularly on weekends, discarded paper bags are located on the street edges and on parking spaces.
"Why?" I asked.
Are people too deaf to take the bags home or to the next garbage bin?
It’s not just that the paperwork alters the landscape.
Bags have already covered traffic facilities such as guide boards and caused accidents.
But what "disposable society" said about such thinking, it probably doesn't even know what this word actually means.
If you’re on the road more often in the evening, just with several people in the car, you know what a backseat can look like after nights of celebration: clothes, bottles and other garbage tower there.
There would be a few bags more or less that would not matter - unlike the street, where no one wants to step into the rest of the food of others.
I see the day coming when cities and communities will have to be fooled by the evacuation - and the fast food chains will have to demand for their bags.
Obama's Retreat in Health Policy
After fierce criticism, President Obama made a retreat yesterday with his repeated, unambiguous promise: “If you like your health insurance, you can keep it.”
After receiving hundreds of thousands of letters of termination from their insurer, Republicans have accused the president in recent days of cheating on the American public.
Yesterday, Obama relativized his original promise.
“The overwhelming majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance can keep them,” he said in a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on the dismissals, Obama called on those Americans who have received such communications to look for new insurance in the free market.
Most citizens could thus get a better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than anticipated.
“You have a better offer,” he said.
The government said it was not surprising that the five percent of the population who have completed insurance themselves would have to look at a different rate as their contract does not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
“I want to tell these Americans quite straightforwardly: they deserve better,” Sebelius said at a hearing before the House of Representatives Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online platform had been “miserable” since October.
“I’m just as frustrated and angry as everyone else,” she said.
I am determined to regain your trust.
This statement of an enraged Sebelius to a consultant behind her at the House of Representatives hearing yesterday was recorded after a dispute with Republican MP Billy Long of Missouri, about whether she should be obliged to attend Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly asked why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily give up state-sponsored insurance to complete a fee at HealthCare.gov, which they now sell to millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syrian air base
A U.S. government official who wanted to remain anonymous told CNN on Thursday that Israeli fighter jets had attacked an air base in Syria's Latakia a day earlier.
The target was “missiles and associated equipment” that the Israeli government feared were intended for Lebanese Hezbollah, CNN said.
Syrian and Lebanese media, as well as Arab broadcaster Al-Arabiya, had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia was shot on Wednesday night on Thursday, and made the Israelis responsible for it.
The Israeli television channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia, on which Russian S-125 Newa defensive missiles as well as a battery of SA-3 missiles were seen, which according to Channel 2 can have a range of 35 kilometres and can transport heads up to 70 kilograms.
Uncertain The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, Reuters quotes an anonymous Israeli government official as saying he believes Israel has carried out the attack, but is unsure.
A spokesman for the Israeli Defense Ministry said: “We are not commenting on these reports.”
Journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in the daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had already been partly successful in attempting to deliver ground-to-air missiles to Hezbollah.
The Israeli government has repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would mean crossing a “red line” to which a military response would follow.
John Kerry says in an unprecedented confession that U.S. espionage has gone “unprecedentedly far”
John Kerry pointed out with an unexpected confession that the U.S.’s dissuasive attitude toward its surveillance programs was “unprecedentedly far-reaching” in certain cases.
The foreign minister also admitted that he cheated along with Barack Obama on the responsibility of switching to “autopilot” when Whistleblower Edward Snowden’s explosive revelations about the NSA’s espionage activities became public.
Due to the leaked information, the U.S. government has fallen into a diplomatic storm of disarmament by its allies.
Speaking at the Open Government conference in London, Kerry said: “Almost without a doubt, the President and I and others in the government have learned of some things that have been done almost by autopilot, simply because of the ability to do so, as well as the 11 years of the Second World War.
Subsequently, he was the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage had crossed a border, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said, “In some cases, this has gone too far inappropriately.”
The President is determined to create clarity, and therefore conducts a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuse takes place here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons will not be affected in this process.
However, Kerry insisted that the NSA was a force of good and that many lives had been saved through its surveillance operations.
He added: “We are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves up.”
There is a radical extremism in the world that is obsessed with killing people, blasting into the air and attacking governments.
So what if you were able to catch it and stop it before it happens?
We have actually prevented aircraft crashes, attacks on buildings, and the killing of people because we have learned of such plans in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe to dispel concerns against the alleged U.S. espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue to cooperate with the U.S. in anti-terror efforts, as the chairman of the Senate Sub-Committee on the European Commission has said.
Senator Chris Murphy, from Connecticut, said he had spoken to representatives of the European Parliament and other people this week and was concerned about their threats of no longer participating in anti-terrorism organizations due to the frustration over surveillance by the National Security Agency.
“It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that Europeans remain on board with regard to our joint efforts against terrorism,” said Murphy, who is sitting in the Senate as a Democrat for the first time and chairman of the Senate’s Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs.
In addition, I am going to Europe to make it clear that we need to continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their annoyance about the NSA programs.
Media reports, according to which the NSA has collected millions of telephone data in Europe, have burdened relations with some US allies, although the head of the intelligence service this week declared the reports to be inaccurate and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata shared with the NATO allies.
Other revelations were cited from documents forwarded by Snowden, according to the NSA monitoring the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state around the world.
The head of the National Intelligence Service, James Clapper, defended spying on allies as necessary, declaring that this was common on both sides.
In all the turmoil, Murphy said his authority was preparing for the Congress trip to take place this year, and hoped the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating Members will be published in the coming days.
He said the exact route was still being developed.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he also said there would be some “serious words.”
He said the European governments should be honest with their people about the kind of espionage programs they have been using for years.
“While we can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also find themselves with the fact that we are not the only ones to spy on,” Murphy said.
In the meantime, John Kerry plans a trip to the Middle East and Poland over the weekend to deal with the grievances over the US strategy in Syria, Egypt, and Iran, as well as US surveillance activities.

Mainz is about the use of Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he will try to train with the team.
Until now, he was only able to do that individually.
"We will decide on its use in the short term," coach Thomas Tuchel said.

Australian woman appeals for prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been raped by a taxi driver, has appealed against the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty on June 15 by a provincial court in Phuket of making a false statement to the Thai police after she reported that a local taxi driver arrested her in the morning hours of Sunday, June 10, while she raped others.
Later, however, the footage of a video camera showed that she had safely arrived at her hotel after being separated from her Australian friend.
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until she could have thought of the story.
Until the trial, she was in police custody on the spot.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in prison in a low-security prison on the outskirts of Phuket, rather than in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgy League, who turned to the Foreign Ministry in Canberra asking for help for his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about his daughter's well-being and wanted to have her back to Australia.
“We are of course very concerned, but we hope she will be home as soon as possible,” Tunks said.
Bamford has appealed against the verdict and is against a 50,000 baht bail.
In Australian reports it was read that in the meantime she is vacationing in the resort of Krabi in South Thailand.
On the court side, it was heard that Bamford was being represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and was warned that the appeal could also lead to a higher sentence of up to two years in an adult prison.
However, it is also possible that Thailand may have tried to improve its impacted tourist image after the recent assassination of travel merchant Michelle Smith in Phuket, and that is why it comes to a plea.
