UN chief says there are no military solutions in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia’s military support for Syria is that “there is no military solution” to the conflict lasting almost five years and more weapons would only aggravate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief once again called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said Wednesday at a conference that he intends to meet with foreign ministers from five permanently present countries in the council - the United States, Russia, China, England and France - on the verge of a ministerial session of the General Assembly to discuss Syria.
Ban expressed his regret that the divisions in the council and between the Syrian people and regional powers "made this situation unresolved".
Ban called on the five permanent members to demonstrate the solidarity and unity they showed when they managed to conclude a nuclear-weapon deal with Iran, thereby addressing the crisis in Syria.
8 figures from polls that show Donald Trump has real chances
Some have tried to label him a “flip-flop” politician.
Others called it a joke.
Others are waiting for implosion.
But no matter how some Republicans try to knock Donald Trump out of the top of the polls, it didn’t work (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown that Donald Trump is leading with a two-digit percentage and some voices are beginning to seriously wonder what this means for the chances of the real estate mogul being appointed.
Of course, it's still premature.
None of this says that Trump will win the race for the nomination of Republicans.
Pundits shows that in the same period of 2011, Rick Perry's advance made room for Herman Cain in the polls, but none of them won in any state in the nomination race.
And the reasons why they would struggle hard in the general election are numerous.
But outside groups such as Jeb Bush’s Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth acknowledge Trump’s power and begin to support him with money.
Below are some figures from recent surveys that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a thing of the past:
The figures indicating support for Trump have returned to 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his nomination in mid-June, a survey conducted by the University of Monmouth showed that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive opinion about the property mogul.
By mid-July, the percentage had risen to 40%.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Currently, six out of 10 Republicans have a favourable opinion about Donald Trump.
Approximately three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
These figures are retained.
A poll conducted last week by Quinnipiac in Iowa concluded that 60% of Republicans in the region have a favorable opinion about Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy if Trump won the nomination race.
In a poll conducted last week by CNN/ORC, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be “enthusiastic” or “satisfied” if Trump wins the nomination race.
Only two out of 10 say they would be “overpowered” if Trump wins the nomination race.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be “enthusiastic” over 40 percent who say the same thing about Trump).
What is the closest thing about enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, with only 21%.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be “unhappy” or “overwhelmed” if favorite Jeb Bush wins the nomination race.
Most Republicans don’t consider Trump’s temperament a problem.
Although Donald Trump has been heavily criticized for insults and his bombing style, 52% of Republican voters at the national level believe the property mogul has the right temperament to be president, according to a poll conducted Monday by ABC News/Washington Post.
We find the same figures in Iowa, where 52% of Republicans believe Trump has the right personality to be a leader, according to a poll conducted last week by Quinnipiac.
However, 44% believe they do not have the personality needed to act effectively, and nearly six out of 10 independents say their temperament has nothing to do with the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When taking the attitude of intellectuals, Republican voters consider Trump to be authentic.
According to a poll conducted last week by CNN/ORC, when asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination race, four out of 10 said Trump.
The situation has changed since the end of July, when four out of 10 would have bet on Jeb Bush.
Full information: in the past, GOP voters did not read the future very well.
In the same period of the last election, four out of 10 Republicans elected Rick Perry in the nomination race, up from only 28% for Mitt Romney.
However, these figures show that most GOP voters consider Trump’s campaign plausible.
Even if the Republicans or replicated to another candidate. Trump is still at the forefront of everyone.
Some voices say the split situation will probably contribute to Trump’s victory, while support against Trump will be divided into more than twelve candidates.
But a survey conducted in early September by the University of Monmouth shows that, in the hypothetical situation of a collaboration between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always benefit from majority support.
Trump is 13 points away from Carly Fiorina, 14 points from Marco Rubio, 15 points from Walker, 19 points from Jeb Bush and finally 33 points from Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It's almost equal to Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would beat the 19-point businessman in a hypothetical one-to-one confrontation.
The majority of Donald Trump’s supporters say they have made a decision.
A new poll conducted Tuesday by CBS/NYT shows that more than half of voters who support Trump say they are not changing their voting options.
Obviously, a lot can happen in this sense and no one can say that they will never change their mind.
46% say they leave the door open to the possibility of changing their options.
However, Trump’s most important opponent is currently neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but it’s twice as likely as voters who say they’ve decided to vote with Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexico’s immigrants “violators” in his campaign opening speech two months ago, immigration has been the central subject of the 2016 campaign.
Some are concerned that Trump’s bombing style will lead to a split between prominent Hispanic voters and the Republican Party and will damage rebranding efforts.
But according to a poll conducted Monday by ABC/Post, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So, it seems that as long as the immigration issue remains in the light of the reflectors, so will Doland Trump.
Frustration towards the authorities reaches new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now supported by nearly half of Republican voters, largely because of their status as outsiders.
According to a poll conducted Monday by ABC/Post, six out of 10 Republicans say they prefer a political outsider to someone with experience in government.
People are also angry at the Washington authorities.
A survey conducted two weeks ago in Iowa by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated by the performance of the Republicans in Congress, 54% saying they are “unhappy” and 21% “nervous at the top.”
Jeremy Corbyn makes his debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn’s debut at PMQs has been long awaited
The new Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, will later make his debut at Prime Minister’s Questions, confronting David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will address the first of the six questions he is entitled to shortly after lunch; his performance will likely be closely analysed by the media and the Labour MPs.
During the weekly appearances, he called for "less theatre and more facts".
He also said that he could give up some of the attendance and that he was giving it to his colleagues.
The confrontation will be Mr Corbyn's first parliamentary test as a leader, coming after he appointed a "fantasy cabinet" and after his speech at Tuesday's TUC annual congress.
Meanwhile, the Labour Party leader’s decision to keep quiet about the national anthem in a service held on Tuesday on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of England attracted criticism from conservative parliamentarians and held the first page of the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr. Corbyn said he "preserved the silence respectfully" and acknowledged "the heroism of the British Air Force in the Battle of England."
But a member of Mr Corbyn’s ghost cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC’s Two’s Newsnight that it would have recommended the Labour leader to sing the national anthem “no matter” his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Around twelve ministers in the ghost cabinet refused to be part of Corbyn’s lead team, arguing by differences of opinion regarding economy, defence and foreign affairs, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
The BBC’s political correspondent, Robin Brant, said the political differences “accumulate” in the Labour Party after Mr Corbyn’s appointment of his position towards the European Union and the benefit limit.
Mr Corbyn said at the TUC conference that the Labour Party will make amendments that will completely remove the idea of limitation.
A few hours later, Smith, the Minister of Labour and Pensions, said the party was “very clear” in its exclusive opposition to the government’s plans to reduce the head level from <0xC2><0xA3>26,000 to <0xC2><0xA3>23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron has faced at the tribune in the last decade since he took over the Conservative Party leadership.
The Labour leader, who promised a different approach to politics, says he has ideas “from external sources” for questions to be asked to Mr Cameron and that he has received over 30,000 suggestions.
MP Islington North said PMQs involve too high a level of confrontation and will refrain from replications and attacks, committing themselves to focus instead on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges young people face.
Mr. Corbyn said Angela Eagle, the Finance Minister, will hold her seat at PMQs when he cannot participate – for example, when Mr. Cameron is moving abroad.
He also expressed the idea that he would allow other colleagues to take the floor occasionally, saying he approached the President of the Chamber of Deputies, John Bercow, to discuss this issue.
In 2005, when he took over the leadership, Cameron said he wanted to quit the "Punch and Judy" political style often associated with PMQs but admitted a few years later that he failed in his demeanor.
From the first transmission in 1990, PMQs were considered a key barometer of a leader's reasoning, the way he leads the House of Representatives and his position among fellow MPs, although critics claim it has become a caricature and needs a deep reform.
“Framework in Joburg”: Young People Without Housing Benefit from Photography Courses
It's hard to be a homeless man in Johannesburg.
But a group of people who lived on the streets in childhood found a way to learn a job and earn a living.
“I was shot in Joburg” is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people to take pictures of the areas they live in and earn money from it.
BBC News met one of the first graduates of the project.
JD Sports CEO Says Higher Wages Could Damage Expansion
JD Sports chairman Peter Cowgill said a minimum wage increase in the UK could mean “a greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers.”
However, it is unlikely that that purchasing power will exceed the higher costs for the workforce within the company, he says.
The costs could have an impact on JD Sports’ expansion plans, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by Australian Tennis President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserved to be praised and not criticized for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was a collateral victim in the "turn" created around her friend, Nick Kyrgios, and her behavior deserves praise rather than criticism, according to Tennis Australia president Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger part of the talented duo often called "Special Ks," was unpleasantly drawn in the light of the flashlights by Kyrgios' scandalous blunder against Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters Tournament.
In a qualifying crane game played shortly after, in Cincinnati, the seat arbitrator had to intervene twice to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, after which Harrison said, "The whawrinka should have put him on, I should have put him on.
Although he was last seen making a rocket dust after he had muscle cramps and missed a possible US Open tournament, angry at Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was firmly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, where he is fighting Sam Groth for second place at the individual, after Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-finals against England.
“One thing that I feel strong is that in my opinion Thanasi has been drawn a little bit into the conflict,” Healy said.
The truth is that he broke a rocket when he lost because he accused cramps in the US, but he’s not the first player to break a rocket out of frustration with himself and I know Thanasi well enough to know he wouldn’t be proud of it.
But to be serious, he managed extremely well in rather challenging situations in the U.S. with Harrison and so on and I think he deserves a lot of trust.
He has an extraordinary team, he has a great family with him, and I think he was treated unfairly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, working hard and integrated into the team, had no kind of conflict with the other players, he is very respected at dressing, he trains hard, he is in an excellent form, he is a very balanced and mature young man and he thinks he deserves to be judged on horseback.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios into account for the important draw, which begins on Friday, and described the "common decision" as the most suitable for all, but supported the return of the original player from Canberra to the team in the long term.
“First of all, we want the team to focus fully on the draw and not think at all of the controversy around [Kyrgios],” Healy said.
And I think Nick has climbed up very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray have claimed, he's matured under the public's gaze and made some terrible mistakes and deserves to be criticized, but we're trying to support him for the time he needs, and we're trying to help him have a good time, and we're trying to make sure he's got the consequences.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage over Bernie Sanders halved in national polls
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still has a two-digit advantage in the Democratic race for national candidacy, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins the field.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of Democratic voters (down from 58%), while Sanders is second, with 27% (up from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for the presidency, is supported by 15% of Democratic voters.
At least five months before the start of the primary election, most Democrats say it’s too early to say they’ve decided on the candidate they’ll support.
But Clinton’s supporters are firmer in their choice than the supporters of other candidates.
In contrast to the poll conducted by CBS news last month, Clinton lost ground in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders gained a few percent.
Clinton retains the advantage among women and the moderators, but the advantage has diminished.
Men’s support has drastically decreased and Sanders is only 5 points away.
Clinton’s advantage among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, being now equal to Sanders.
However, Clinton is still in the forefront of the electorate.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders, with a two-digit percentage among liberals, but Sanders now has a slight 5-point advantage in the group.
Approximately half of Democratic voters at the national level say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were elected to run for the party.
One quarter would support it somewhat reserved and the other 15% would support it only because it represents the party.
Six percent would not support it.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the likelihood that Clinton’s current supporters will be enthusiastic about its choice is high.
Opinions are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton — only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48% of Democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, the number of Republican voters stating the same thing about first-ranked Donald Trump (35%) is lower.
When Clinton’s supporters are asked an open question about why she would like to win the race, the majority answer is that she has the right experience (16%), followed by the fact that it’s time for a woman to be president (10%) and that she’s the best candidate for that.
Clinton’s supporters also mention her association with Bill Clinton (9%).
The agreement on these issues and eligibility shall also be mentioned.
Given that the vice president is considering a possible presidential nomination, 57 percent of Democratic voters would like to see him in the race – although a third do not think he should run.
On the question of a second option for the party’s representative, the Democratic voters call Biden the majority.
Of Clinton’s supporters, more than half claim that Biden would be the second option, much ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run in the Democratic race, Hillary Clinton’s advantage over Sanders increases from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 if he doesn’t run.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters consider Clinton to be the most likely candidate to win the general election, but the figures fell from 78 percent last month.
Biden is in second place but the percentage that he is most eligible has increased.
However, when asked what is most important to an elected candidate, Democratic voters prefer issues rather than eligibility.
Like last month, no Democratic candidate or possible candidate is considered by these voters to be unacceptable as a representative of the party in the presidential race.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates are doing well in terms of some key characteristics compared to their party’s primary voters.
Most voters consider Clinton, Sanders, and Biden to be integrity and trustworthy and have solid leadership qualities.
Biden is seen as the best of all three in terms of integrity, while Clinton’s strength is leadership.
Thirty-three percent of Democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is integrated and trustworthy, twice as many as those who declare this about Sanders (15%), but 27 percent do not have an opinion about him in that regard.
Democratic voters also generally believe that the three, Clinton, Sanders and Biden, have the same ideologies as they do.
With regard to all of these, about a quarter of Democrats voters don’t have an opinion on Sanders.
As questions persist regarding Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal email address and a server while she was Secretary of State, most Democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say that their general opinion of the candidate has not been affected.
But things are different for the American public.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with its explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion was divided in March on the subject, shortly after the issue came to light.
The majority of Americans say the email controversy has not affected their general opinion about Clinton, although 36% say they have changed their opinion in a negative way.
Most Republicans, more than six out of 10, say they have changed their minds about Clinton in a negative way.
Although Democratic voters consider Clinton integrity and trustworthiness, this issue continues to raise problems among voters at the general level: only 32% consider it integrity and trustworthiness, 8% less than last month and 15% less than in May.
62% of voters don’t think it’s complete and reliable.
At the same time, 55% of voters at the national level do not consider Trump to be integrity and trustworthy.
However, both Clinton and Trump have white balls for leadership.
Of the six assessed candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush rank first in terms of integrity.
The number of those who consider Sanders integral is greater than those who are not of the same opinion, however, as in the case of Carson, many do not have an opinion about him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 primary Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Five Brotherhood Members Accused of Murdering Student in Year 1 of Baruch Faculty
Almost two years after a college student lost his life during an initiation ritual in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood at New York’s Baruch Faculty brutally attacked Chun “Michael” Deng during an initiation ritual in September 2013 and postponed him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, according to police statements.
Official sources say the victim was tied to his eyes, a 14-kg-pack full of sand was placed behind him and was repeatedly abruptly smashed while trying to reach a target on frozen ground.
Mr. Deng accused of headaches after which he lost consciousness.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi brother did not call the emergency number after the man fell asleep and claimed to have waited an hour before taking him to the hospital, police said.
But they found the time to change Deng’s clothes, look for his symptoms on Google and contact Andy Meng, the brotherhood’s president at the national level, to seek his advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a news conference.
“At this point, the members started concealing personal belongings and practically put the brother’s good ahead of the good of Michael Deng,” Wagner said.
He could not be resurrected and died the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated trauma to the head, trunks, and thighs.
“Too many families have been devastated by the brotherhood rituals, since 1970 at least one student has lost his life each year because of the rituals,” Deng’s lawyer Douglas Fierberg said in a statement.
Brothers and their members must be held accountable and this measure taken by the authorities is important.
The Grand Jury of Monroe District recommended that the first five members be charged with third-degree murder.
Thirty-two other members of the brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with ultra-j and complicity in the murder.
“We want to take responsibility not only for the people involved, but if there is an organization that has officially or unofficially authorized the brotherhood, we will also take responsibility for it,” Wagner said at a press conference.
The Baruch Faculty banned the fraternity and the national fraternity withdrew its affiliation with the local representative.
This is what will happen when the Federal Reserve increases interest rates
The interest rate will rise and the bull market (increasing market) will shrink, bond profitability will increase and the economy will go into recession.
That's what we know.
What we don’t know is how long it will happen and how long it will last.
In economics, history offers little clues about time-framing.
After the first interest rate increase, the recession occurred in just 11 months and lasted 86 months.
The Federal Reserve’s aggressiveness to raise interest rates is often, though not always, a decisive factor in how the economy and financial assets respond.
That’s why U.S. central bank officials have so strongly emphasized that investors should not focus on the moment the interest rate starts to rise, but on the trajectory of the time required for normalization.
In fact, there are several variables in the game.
However, in the end, market players could find that all the agitation related to the increase in the interest rate was exaggerated.
“The first rate increase decided by the Fed after the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some voices as a sign of the ‘cheap baths’ era,” Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, said in a note addressed to customers.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to more normal levels but still small to constitute the seismic shock that everyone seems to be afraid of.
However, it cannot be said that there will be no effects.
Below we present how several sectors of the economy could react, based on historical trends:
Given the situation the market has faced in recent months, anticipating an interest rate increase can volatilize things for a while.
However, at the time of growth, the impact is not so dramatic.
“There seems to be a tendency for capital’s profitability to stagnate for 12-24 months after the first growth, which may again reflect the breakdown in monetary policy,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what will happen after the Fed’s growth.
Specifically, in the last 35 years, the market has grown abruptly - by about 14 percent - heading towards an increase in interest rate, quite unchanged in the period of 250 days after (every average of 2.6%) after which it returns to normal after 500 days, with an average return of an average of 4% in the last 14 cycles.
Deutsche said the impact on shares tends to become pronounced later in the interest rate growth cycle and the benefits begin to fall.
Recession is a reality of economic life, but rising interest rates often contribute to it.
In the present situation, the Fed is facing conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession.
Specifically, the gross domestic product will approach its historic minimum point for a Fed interest rate increase.
According to Deutsche Bank, out of the 118 interest rate increases since 1950, nominal GDP was only twice as low as 4.5%.
Although in the second quarter of 2015 the value was 3.6%, few are expected to persist, with the third quarter reaching just 1.5%, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Increasing interest rates in such a fragile economy could be risky and raise the question "if this time is different," Deutsche said.
Market players have been preparing for a growth decision by the Fed all year round, with all eyes focused on this week’s meeting of the Federal Open Market Commission, which ends Thursday.
Although many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an interest rate increase at this meeting, futures trades indicate a 25% probability.
“In our 1950 study, all interest rate growth cycles to date have been in a super-profit growth cycle, with GDP eclipsing the peaks before the recession very quickly after the start of recovery,” the report said.
On the contrary, this was a strange slow recovery after the most severe recession of the period analyzed.
The current cycle is by far the longest expected by the Fed since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and it reached 74 months and continues.
Fixed income was also volatile given that the market anticipates an interest rate increase and the pattern is somewhat similar to that of dividends.
The main difference is that the impact is faster in the case of bonds than in the case of shares when the Fed changes policy.
In the case of bonds, the benefits seem to change direction as soon as the first increase/down of the cycle occurs.
At the end of the interest rate growth cycle, the return on bonds will drop immediately,” Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab’s strategies are of the opinion that these interest rate increases will lead to the approximation of profitability between short-term bonds and long-term bonds, flattening the curve.
High profitability bonds are better handled in such an environment, although “we are still cautious about forcing profitability,” said in an analysis Kathy Jones, a fixed-income analyst at Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to Fed policy expectations.
“In addition to the power of the dollar and the estimated decline in inflation, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of a more rigorous monetary policy,” Jones wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the profitability curve is straighter, the average credit interest rate spread has expanded and volatility has increased – all the characteristics of the market when the Fed tightens policy.
Overall, companies that carry out their major business in the U.S. will have to profit from rising interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
Multinationals with high debts will suffer because the rise of the dollar will lead to the cost of their products in the global market space and their debt will be more expensive.
“History shows that ‘quality’ stocks tend to be more profitable in the three months following an initial interest rate increase,” Goldman Sachs said in a report to customers.
Firms with strong balance sheets exceeded those with a weak balance sheet after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, with an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital and low volatility stocks also exceeded similar companies with lower quality, with an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Duty will become an important issue.
Companies with a high percentage of floating debt have the most to lose, Goldman says.
Consumers will also benefit from the increase in the dollar.
Those who are saving could also have to gain, although experts do not agree on how quickly this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham has criticized the radio station for "slowing"
It claims that it is increasingly similar to the commercial opponent
He also stared at the BBC Music Awards, claiming to have plagiarized the British awards.
Colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice, stating that the show is not original either.
BBC Radio 3 is “transforming into” Classic FM, a senior MP said, putting pressure on the post to prove that he is doing something that commercial posts don’t do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC chiefs that the public radio station “sweeps up” and resembles more and more the commercial opponent.
“I have the impression that Radio 3 is ‘slowing up’ – although I don’t like to use the word – but I have the impression that it’s turning into Classic FM,” he said.
He also won the BBC Music Awards, released last year in December.
The BBC Music Awards, released last year, seem to be Brits under another name.
So if you’re trying to do something different – these are the two examples that come to mind that just copy what’s already on the market,” Bingham said.
The director-general of the BBC denied the allegations, saying that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial opponent in terms of live music and public education.
I'm not going to find out about the classical music I've heard from Radio 3.
And his commitment to live music and production has no rival.
“In addition, I think it’s also important that Radio 3’s commitment to discover new music and allocate new pieces,” he said.
In the first part of this year, BBC Radio 3 editor Alan Davey said he must make more efforts to attract audiences from the previous period because the British have less knowledge of classical music.
But Radio 3 was not the only BBC criticised at the meeting of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport because it would follow in the footsteps of its commercial rivals.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice – the talent show purchased by the BBC from Dutch producer Talpa Media for about <0xC2><0xA3>22 million.
Do you understand why there are often discussions about the show because it is not original and is not distinguished by anything?
Lord Hall insisted that the show performed by BBC1 - having Paloma Faith and Boy George in the jury - be performed "in a BBC-specific way."
He added that he wants the corporation to “find the chicken with golden eggs in its own yard” the next time it launches an entertainment show.
However, he declined to ban future acquisition of new seasons of The Voice or spend money on licenses on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales recorded the slightest increase in August, and the culprit could be Black Friday
In the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%.
In the last month, the slowest growth has been recorded since 2000 to date.
Online sales took off three years ago, thanks to the use of a mobile phone to shop.
Experts believe that November’s Black Friday could lead to reticence in spending.
For more than a decade, online shopping has exploded and turned the shopping streets of the UK into ghost cities.
However, experts say there are signs that online sales are decreasing, with the latest figures indicating a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
The total money spent in August showed the slightest growth since 2000 so far, with only 5% growth in the last year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are decreasing, with the latest figures indicating a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
“If we look at the level of growth from previous years and go back to 2000, there has always been a tendency to rationalize over time,” Andy Mulcahy, editor at the IMRG sales index, told Guardian.
He explained that online sales took off three years ago, when shoppers started using their mobile phone to make purchases.
Thus, it increased the number of people who could shop online and could do it in various circumstances, such as from the sofa.
But now that it’s stagnating a little, you might notice a decrease (increase).
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
According to specialists, buyers would refrain from making purchases before the event that takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, the average number of buyers went up five times in front of computers to put their hands on bids, which led to the collapse of the websites of several retailers.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when buyers were battling chips, could determine buyers’ reticence.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that at least <0xC2><0xA3>1 out of every <0xC2><0xA3>5 is spent online.
In the case of certain products, such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are currently made through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy clothes and shoes online rather than resort to fashion stores in the shopping areas.
After the Ben Laden family’s sanctions, Muslims bury the victims killed in Mecca’s collapse
The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were strolled on the streets by Muslims, the first funerals taking place in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia partially blamed the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group for its collapse.
The Minister of Health said a total of 394 people were injured in the crash.
In the street walk ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed by a mob that collapsed at the large mosque in Mecca.
Dressed in white, those who were complaining about the dead joined in the way to express their condolences, until the first dead man reached the end of the final journey at the Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
The sad memory of the holy place, where just a few days ago a building shell collapsed through the ceiling of the mosque, falling on the believers.
The bodies were released for the funeral after the king of Saudi Arabia sanctioned the Bin Laden family’s construction group for the disaster, which also killed 394 people.
During the ceremony on the street, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed by a mob that collapsed at the large mosque in Mecca.
Among the victims were the father of four children, Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Great Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the macara collapsed.
Mr. Akram was in the Great Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the hajj pilgrimage to Mecca will continue, with thousands of pilgrims still arriving in the city.
Today, King Salman stated that the Binladin Group should not have left the arm of the scaffold up when the scaffold was not in operation.
An Arab version of the decree, published by the Saudi Press Agency, said the Binladin Group was partly to blame for the collapse.
The news agency's English service did not provide the details, but said the company's leaders had been banned from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the mound to collapse in the courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims came before the hajj pilgrimage that took place later this month.
The Binladin Group has not yet made statements about the collapse of the shell and representatives of the Group could not be contacted for statements.
The Royal Decree blamed the group for not using up-to-date safety measures and did not coordinate its work with the weather authorities.
Dozens of mounds surround the Great Mosque in Mecca, as part of the massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
For several decades, the Binladin family has had a close relationship with the Saudi royal family and is conducting major construction projects.
Al-Qaeda’s last leader, Osama bin Laden, was a “renegated” son, who was deprived of his family in the 1990s.
The crash occurred in strong winds and rains, just days before the arrival of millions of people in the kingdom to participate in pilgrimage, an essential journey at least once in the life of every physically fit Muslim.
Authorities say 158 people remain in the hospital.
Authorities have decided that the relatives of the dead victims should receive one million Saudi riyals (<0xC2><0xA3>174,000) and pay the same amount to those with permanent injuries.
The other wounded will receive half of this amount.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Credit Conversion in Swiss Francs
On the banking market, two offers have already emerged for converting credits in Swiss francs in lei, the main advantages being the exclusion of currency risk and the reduction of rates.
Disadvantages can come in a few years, when variable interest rates can lead to increased rates.
Bank Transylvania has just completed the process of converting credits into francs granted by Volksbank, and Bankpost has announced a conversion offer for its customers.
According to data collected by financial portal analysts FinZoom, Bancpost offers three years of fixed interest rate, 1.5%, the smallest in the market.
On the other hand, Bank Transylvania’s conversion offer was accepted by 83% of clients with loans in francs due to two consecutive reductions: the balance was reduced by the value of the client’s risk commissions and administration, and then an additional 22.5% reduction was applied to the balance in lei.
Both offers reduce the rates of their customers, compared to how much they paid monthly equivalent in lei before conversion.
Thus, Banka Transylvania reduced the rate by 42.5%, and Bancpost by 33% in the first three years and, theoretically, by 18% in the following years.
Benefits
The main advantage of the lending currencies in CHF is that the currency risk is eliminated, the consumer being protected from future growths of the franc, and the repayment of the credit will be made in the currency in which he deposits his salary.
Another major advantage of both conversion offers is that there is no re-evaluation of the property, no further guarantees and another proof of revenue are required.
In practice, there will be no new financial and legal analysis of the credit and there will be no additional costs as in the case of a refinancing.
Also, both banks offer discounts at the monthly rate, compared to how much customers paid before conversion, the equivalent in lei.
Risks
The problem is that the rate in the first years is more of the interest, and the customer pays very little of the principal.
The Bancpost offer with very low interest rates in the first three years seems advantageous to customers.
However, it is not known how this interest rate will evolve after three years.
The margin offered to customers can be more than 3.25%, so overall, and the cost reduction is less.
A possible risk for all leased lending with a variable interest rate is that the ROBOR index will grow significantly in the coming years (more than the Libor - CHF index).
For example, ROBOR at three months is now 1.44%, but in 2013 it reached the value of 6%, in 2009, to over 15%, and in a few days of 2008 it exceeded 40%!
In addition, it is possible to bear other costs, unmentioned in the initial offer.
The time has come to decide on the interest rate for the U.S. Federal Reserve
The world is looking at the meeting scheduled for two days, Wednesday and Thursday, when the U.S. Federal Reserve will make the crucial decision whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in about a decade.
In a survey conducted by Reuters with the participation of 80 economists, just over half thought last week that the decision would be taken, now I think the situation will remain for a while and that interest rates will be maintained in the current range of 0-0.25%.
It’s a historic event because it’s been seven years since the Federal Reserve brought rates to zero.
For the first time, we are facing a situation in which a major central bank could abandon the zero rate and initiate a process of normalizing interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, chief analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has evolved relatively well, bringing trillions of dollars into the balance sheet and generating a low level of inflation.
But the Federal Reserve should not ignore the less pink global situation.
He warned markets to prepare for growth, but there are signs that even they believe such a move is unlikely.
The decision will be announced Tuesday, 20:00 CET.
Stars who have lost their charm
The actor (left), alongside his son Redmond (right), has been through stressful situations in recent years.
In 2001 she struggled with leukemia and in 2009 she lost her life partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
It is also rumored that the actor had faced the problem of drug use and was arrested in 2008 for possession of drugs.
All of this certainly has a cost.
Manchester United player Luke Shaw has been on the bar for several months due to double fractures.
Luke Shaw suffered a double leg fracture in Manchester United's Champions League match, which ended with a defeat to PSV Eindhoven.
After the event that brought tears to the player’s eyes and will keep him on the bar for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury occurred following an unintentional intervention by Hector Moreno in the 15th minute after 20-year-old Shaw broke PSV defense.
He received medical care for nine minutes on the ground and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: “He has a double fracture in his leg and he’s in the hospital.”
He'll be transferred tomorrow, or maybe later, and then he'll be operated on in Manchester.
It's awful - a boy who came to Manchester United when he was 18, he's in trouble, then he plays fantastic and now that's what happens.
He was wearing a mask of oxygen in the locker room.
She was crying.
I am not a doctor, but at the double fracture the rest is six months and will not play in the group phase.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno appears to have been fortunate and escaped the red card and the concession of a penalty kick.
Arbiter Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian official was wrong.
You can judge by yourself when they say it’s faulty and red cardboard.
It was a very ugly two-legged intervention.
Shaw tweeted: “Thank you all for the messages, I have no words to express how weak I feel, I start my way to recovery, I will come back stronger.”
Manchester United hit by injury to Luke Shaw in PSV defeat
The founder of the England team has an additional reason to recover to play in the European Championship in France next year in June.
Phillip Cocu, PSV coach, said: “It’s a very hated accident.”
Everyone is very sad when a player suffers such an injury.
Our players never seek to injure an opponent.
Moreno broke his leg playing for Mexico against the Dutch national team led by Van Gaal at the 2014 World Cup.
“It’s very difficult for him because he didn’t intend to hurt his opponent, and when you hear it’s a very serious injury, it’s not good,” Cocu said.
I didn't see the phase.
I was only able to see the ball, which was heading in another direction, so it seemed that [Moreno] touched her but I couldn’t see Luke’s intervention.
In a statement to SBS6, Moreno said: “I know how it is, I know how hard it is to go through something like that.
I feel so bad, I'm so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado also arrived in the hospital after an intervention by Chris Smalling.
Adam Lyth clearly risked England's omission but still holds strong
Victory against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after we saw the England team selected for the tournament, I do not consider a 3-0 defeat repeat in the test matches.
I wouldn’t eliminate any variation of a win in the move.
Perhaps Alastair Cook’s team has less experience than three years ago but has good players on the spin in the batting line and collective morale is strong; they won’t be marked by the events of 2012 but they will have a positive teenage attitude.
Moeen Ali evolves as a spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at the test level, is an option for attack.
Adam Lyth has left England for test matches and was replaced by Alex Hales.
Obviously, as his head coach at Yorkshire, it’s hard for me to analyze the decision not to select Adam Lyth in the team.
He played the seven test matches against two good attackers in difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricketers are judged by the results.
There were no question marks related to Joe Root, for example, until the ads were made because – and I said this before – players are their own pickers.
Fifty years and perhaps Lyth would have extended his run, but his fate lies in his hands.
I hope if he does more runs for Yorkshire he will have other opportunities.
England's main coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude even when performance wasn't as good as his ability and I'm not surprised by this; first of all, he's a team man.
It is difficult to answer the question as long as a batsman is noticed in the test matches.
Lyth had seven runs - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton had nine.
Only Compton was lucky at home and on the move.
The only dissatisfaction you could have was that England preferred Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean Tournament - when Lyth was in the best shape - but that missed opportunity is the domain of the past.
Alex Hales, a batsman whom I highly value.
He’s a cricketer who has “factor X” and I noticed early in Yorkshire this season when he scored 236 against us at a Trent Bridge pitch.
He should be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but this will of course depend on the composition of the UAE team.
The idea was launched for Moeen to open to battle alongside Cook, which would lead to extra spinners keeping at the same time four quicks, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a thrower couldn't hit there and this left-handed player has already shown that he's fucked up.
Maybe Moeen didn't bring success to his district, Worcestershire, but it was No. 3 for them, so the difference isn't big.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 test games as a first drop before entering open in 2001.
He immediately wiped out three centuries and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes on the team as a back-up spinner and although I had limited contact with him, I was struck by the fact that he is a very impressive young man.
People could judge his early age – with an average of 31 at bat and 35 at ball – and they might think it’s a point, but there’s not a lot of spinners and the pickers opted for the youth.
You will learn a lot from this tour.
England also made some changes to the coaching team.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, a Sri Lankan batsman, as a consultant for the test matches could be a master strike.
He is one of the best players and will bring a lot of experience, given that he played in any situation and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white-ball league of the tournament and will bring both energy and uncrossing ambition.
I always thought he was born to be involved in international cricket, either as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has intuition.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room, even if they transmit messages that have been transmitted before, can bring fresh air to the team.
Colly Durham's team-mate Ben Stokes is resting for one-day games, Root has received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that.
Although not everyone agrees, coaches and teams do not make the program.
And you have to keep in mind, the jobs of the players depend on the results they get.
Such decisions are never easy to make.
The Brexit camp could have a win-win if the economy stays calm until 2017
As the day goes by, David Cameron’s renegotiating strategy to keep Britain in the EU gets more and more confused, even without the genius Jeremy’s choice of “Yes or No?” Corbyn to the Labour Party or TUC brings serious critical Tuesdays to Europe.
The aliens also have characters such as Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat explained last day that – immersed in crises similar to those in the EU – not all of them being challenged internally – some Member States are fueled by Britain’s agenda of concessions and treaties amendments, which most do not want.
In Brighton, on the occasion of the annual meeting, TUC decided that they too would not want this if they eroded social protection.
We could even call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
The prime minister and the chancellor participate in bilateral summits or sessions in foreign capitals, take a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then return home and declare that they have won allies for the reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants a UK with an external outlook under the EU roof – “Don’t leave us alone with France,” says Berlin – suggests that several hardworking ministers and officials from certain capitals have reached a point where they don’t care if they stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, the extremely cautious German Chancellor, is an ally who has been in the leadership for 10 years and wants to leave the position before her situation gets worse, as happened to Thatcher (11 years old), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16), who have stayed too long.
In 2017, the president of France, François Hollande, will be real or replaced.
And his power is declining.
Poland could soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain one left-wing.
It is hard to believe that they will help the positioning Englishmen, whose energy would be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK – something they don’t want either because most have similar separatist tendencies.
Thus, some ministers might even plan to make intentional remarks that do not help, in the style of the SNP, in the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
"The renegotiation was fixed" and "The UK got nothing of value from the renegotiation."
Europeans know in their skin how skeptical Fleet Street can be and how skeptical the oligarchal press barons are who look at the EU with skepticism, as they did not participate in the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, which ratified our 1973 entry in a 2:1 ratio.
Maybe they remember Boris Johnson, the Euro-opportunist, who became famous in the early 1990s when he was in Brussels.
Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included the mix of tax-free baggage, phone fraud foreigners and non-domestic pseudonyms that hold most major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair saw them the same way, but he realized that when you’re locked in a cage next to a nervous gorilla, you have to give her bananas to distract her from thinking about eating lunch and tea again.
In fact, Miliband was more blasphemous than Blair in opposition to Cameron’s referendum idea, given that Blair made a concession to the principle of the abandoned EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who offered him a cardboard exit.
The press didn't forgive him for that either.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who touched my friend back in Westminster on Monday — I told him to stop spending time with me — seems to be in danger of adopting from the egg the Murdoch strategy of boycotting Neil Kinnock from the 1980s, a mistake then and now.
It may be hard, but it needs to develop a coherent strategy of cooperation with the media, not with me, but with certainty with Andrew Marr, whose position on the BBC he left off on Sunday.
Corbyn’s official position on Europe is what I would kindly call evolution.
He says he would like to stay in a reformed EU.
The majority of those who disagree with the conservative "Anglicanism" might agree with this.
That’s what Hilary said on radio and TV this week, when her researcher struggled not to recognize that Corbyn’s appointment as “shadow” minister on financial issues was a bad idea.
He reminded me of the 70s, when his father struggled on TV to be disloyal to his colleagues, without going too far and without losing his office.
Hilary's fight was more attractive.
But the struggle to stay "in any situation" - Benn's expression - does not match what McDonnell said or what JC told colleagues and parliamentarians at a private meeting on Monday night.
Regardless of the image that Corbyn wants to convey - remember, it has also made me more aware - the discipline of messages remains important in the era of television and especially in the rage of social networks, a focal point of paranoia and betrayal.
It is fair not to give Cameron a ticket of favor in Europe, allowing him to take good support from the Labour in the referendum campaign, McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly believes this.
But McDonnell and Corbyn’s basic sophism about EU membership – in line with their anti-capitalist past – is no longer just an esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents for which the narcissism of small differences is a central dogma.
As with his sophistication about NATO, Tom Watson is relentless about the fact that JC will not campaign for resignation – foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital – and there are suspicious voters – for concessions to Britain when everything could be useless?
The U.S. is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a conservative government cutting costs, as I recalled at the launch of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts Criticize England’s Department of Public Health’s Decision on Electronic Cigarettes
According to the researchers, claims by a government agency that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting between 12 people, some of them related to the tobacco industry.
The editorial team of the British Medical Journal (BMJ) has joined Lancet in criticizing the evidence used by the Department of Public Health (PHE) in its e-cigarettes report.
PHE published the “reference” report last month and described it as a “complex analysis of evidence.”
However, some researchers questioned the robustness of the data and pointed finger to the links between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
An article published last month in the medical journal Lancet attacked the “extraordinary base of fragility” that PHE founded its main conclusion.
Two other researchers writing in the BMJ questioned the claims and their grounding “on solid ground or on moving sand.”
Martin McKee, professor of public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: “A fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on evidence of effectiveness.”
They said they expect PHE claims that “current estimates show e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking” to be based on a detailed analysis of evidence and models.
In fact, a single meeting in which 12 people participated led to the development of a multi-criteria decision analysis model (MCDA) that summarized their views on the negative effects associated with different nicotine-containing products; the results of this meeting were briefly presented.
McKee and Capewell also claimed that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose executive director was said to have received funding from British American Tobacco in the past for conducting an independent study.
It also validated public health BAT accreditation in a sustainability report, he said.
They added that one of the 12 participants at the meeting said funding received from an e-cigarette maker was not the funding reportedly received from the tobacco and tobacco maker Philip Morris International.
The arguments on the basis of which panel members were selected were not provided, but among them are a few “frontiers” known in the production of e-cigarettes, some of which even declare the financing of the industry.
Other participants in the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The head of the tobacco control section of PHE also participated in the meeting.
The research developed by the group “convincingly masks” the lack of “solid evidence of the harmful effect most products have according to most criteria,” said McKee and Capewell.
However, the PHE report does not mention any of these links or limitations.
McKee and Capewell said PHE’s claims that “to date there is no evidence that e-cigarettes are a factor that encourages smoking among children or non-smokers” are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of the health department at PHE, says he has responded to BMJ’s claims in the past.
He said: “E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking.”
One in two people who have smoked all their lives are dying of this addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the risk of e-cigarettes for health is comparatively lower, but we need to continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about the information that is and does not come from evidence, in particular given the high degree of public confusion regarding the hazards related to tobacco.
Each year, about 80,000 people die from a smoking-related disease and the annual cost of smoking to the national health system is <0xC2><0xA3>2 billion.
By expressing the current evidence - namely that although the use of e-cigarettes is not without risks, they represent only a fraction of the harmful effect of smoking - we are fulfilling our national duty.

Advertising That Shame on Britain's Weapons Trade
Watch Amnesty International’s film against the arms trade.
Horrible killer drones!
Beasts for breaking the ankles!
Bombs with dispersion.
And electric sticks that cause terrifying pain without leaving traces!
The cheerful voice and animated images leave no doubt that this advertisement for the world’s largest arms trade is an acute sharadic, carried out by Amnesty International to highlight the desire of the British authorities to sell arms to repressive regimes through Defence and Security Equipment International at the ExCeck’s DoL Centre in London.
DSEI arms trade fair: authoritarian regimes arrive in London
But a separate campaign also led to the display of a large number of posters in bus stations and in subways that needed a second look.
“An important announcement, do you travel with DLR between September 15 and 18?” says one of the announcements, using the London Metro fonts and branding, the DLR line transformed into the image of a tank.
In September of this year, a lot of arms dealers will plunge into the DLR Clients are being asked to contribute to stop the arms trade.
The 300 posters are made by artists who exhibited the works at the Cruel Designs Museum in Dismaland, Banksy.
A group called the Special Patrol Group contributed to the distribution in London using the “Ad Space Hack Packs,” a <0xC2><0xA3>6 Allen key package that says it “facilitates access to about a third of the advertising space from bus stations on the planet.”
The London transport system is not funny about this “vandalism” in the form of steering wheels.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are asking more and more questions and looking to make political works accessible to the public outside galleries.
Many artists are heading to collaborate with activists in protest movements, realizing that they have to go out into the real world in order for their art to have an impact on society.
Another poster against the arms trade that welcomes the navigators who travel by subway.
The film, produced by Amnesty International, had over 100,000 views on Facebook in 24 hours and was created by the advertising agency VCCP that worked pro bono, and the graphic designer and artist who doubled the voice also worked for free.
VCCP’s creation director, Matt Lever, was shocked by the silence surrounding the arms trade advertisement – with an empty space on the ExCel calendar – and thought, “Let’s offer them the campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They played with a more realistic advertisement, but “enriching it with strong animations and colors, it was more spectacular.”
“They’ve done a great job of helping us grow our interest in selling illegal torture equipment on the market,” said Tom Davies on behalf of Amnesty.
Now, it would be necessary for the UK authorities to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally marketed and delivered to the door.
Perhaps the most creative form of art on the subject of the arms market comes from the inside of ExCeL, where exhibitors offer fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab disclosed an order received from the U.S. military regarding “AT4CS RS with shoulder-supported launcher.”
This includes “a unique-shaped focus that delivers amazing effects behind the armor, inside the target.
Whatever that means, it won't be nice.
Eight Golden Rules to Live in a Home
It’s been 11 years since I moved home, when I was a 19-year-old boy who still believed in bribery and moral relativity, but I can’t remember the hard smiles of those we’re upset about — and the many complaints to others.
Most of what we have learned can be summed up in the form of eight simple rules.
Moving home can lead to conditions ranging from nervous fall to dread.
The flirtation is tempting: tell people where you come from, if and where you spent a year of study break, what you think about Corbyn, and why "honestly, it doesn't matter to you Marmite because, good guys, it's nothing but HAHA yeast extract, you find me in my room."
Breathe deeply.
And help others to breathe – ask questions and show interest in yourself.
They animate the conversation and help you differentiate the people you like from those you wouldn’t talk to even if the flood came and they were the only ones who would have boats.
Don't suffocate people.
Bedrooms are often full of drink parties, movie nights and social gatherings, but they are also a place where people dress up and try their underwear.

That's not only because it keeps good sense, but because you go to your own on the buckets.

On the contrary, wouldn’t it be extremely strange if you confused a colleague with your future husband, coupled, separated, and should meet each other daily and maybe even see him catch up with all the common friends?
Of course, you can’t fight your heart — but if a sexy colleague is definitely not your future husband, at least try to be rational.

David Grimal: There were no world tours in Bach’s time.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who worked, artists and not commercial representatives.
The French violinist David Grimal is one of the great artists of our time, known not only as a soloist but also as the initiator of a less common project, of the right "extraordinary", as he himself says, Les Dissonances - an orchestra composed of international soloists and musicians who make a talented musician.
Les Dissonances was this year at the Enescu Festival with two performances: a performance, on Sunday, in which the soloist was David Grimal, the founder of the orchestra, and a month, when the violinist Xavier Phillips was at the forefront, the works composed by Enescu being inexhaustible.
Both shows, held on the Athens stage, showed the audience a different way of playing classical music.
Les Dissonances appeared on the music scene in 2004, being at that time the only classical ensemble in which there was no conductor.
The conductor is the most important musician for musicians.
It is true, on the one hand, musicians need an education either to become soloists or to become performers in an orchestra - they speak of instrumentals, not composers.
They are formatted as "specialized workers".
They feel like they need a director.
On the other side of the scene, for the public, all the musical fetishization focuses on the director.
And so, the business, the music industry, does its marketing.
We are no longer talking about music.
So, if we look at this world, we have skilled workers on the one hand, which is stupid, and an audience that can’t listen but must look, which is stupid,” said Grimal.
The violinist tells the story that this change in the way he makes music came as a result of "musical deceptions" in his solo career.
I was like a high-level athlete who had to do the same exercise around the world with different orchestras, to earn a lot of money and to bring money and the music industry.
Ten years ago, when I was about 30, I found this very depressing, because I could no longer find human creativity and fraternity in this system.
So, I didn't find any sense anymore to continue on this path.
That's how I decided to create the dissonances.
This happened in 2004, and at the time no one was doing anything like this without a director: "The music world, extremely conservative, didn't want such projects."
“How do you imagine marketing with a group of musicians in which there is no ego anymore?” the artist asks.
David Grimal acknowledges that Les Dissonaces is a "luxury", stating that none of the musicians who are part of the orchestra depend on the success of this project to live.
In 10 years of the ensemble's existence, the lack of a director proved not to be a hindrance in the musical act: "The curiously, the more we sing a more complex repertoire, the simpler it seems, because all the musicians are obliged to be present in the opera and not just in the role."
In Grimal’s opinion, the Enescu Festival is one “very courageous”, precisely because he also invited Les Dissonances: “An extraordinary festival, where are present the largest orchestras in the world that sing and three times a day, and in the midst of these orchestras you have invited this strange group as well.”
In a temple of orchestral tradition, such as the Enescu Festival, there is a place and interest for something different that breaks down barriers.
Speaking of Enescu's work, the violinist recognizes that he feels the Romanian music of the famous Roman composer, so he did not need a special approach when he introduced Enescu's works into his repertoire.
Grimal notes that Enescu's music is very instinctive, but this is what happens when we talk about George Enescu and Romanian music, "because there is also a George Enescu who made French music."
Grimal militates for changing the way classical music education is made, considering that "the musician's craft, as it is organized today, has a cause of death" and that "the future of music is music itself".
We don't need to tour the world five times a year if it doesn't help.
In Bach’s time there were no world tours.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who worked, who were artists and not commercial representatives.
For me, organizing concerts, festivals, tours, launching albums, all are great, extraordinary, but as long as they are done at the service of music.
If not, we are in a system where creativity suffers, it no longer has freedom.
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal set an example for Romanian products before and after joining the European Union: “In Romania, before you join the EU, you had good vegetables and meat.”
In order to enter the EU, you had to pass health laws that are not good for vegetables and meat.
Production and agriculture are at the service of supermarkets, as is the case in France.
The same thing happens to music, it’s the same logic.
Les Dissonances makes the reds may not be too beautiful, but when I cut them they are real reds.
In an ideal world, this music should return to the center and the institutions and industries that manage this system understand that music does not need to be sold, but needs to be shared, and this can be done starting with educational policy.
"If we consider - as the Koreans, the Chinese, the Japanese - that Western music is one of the most beautiful things of humanity, we will reintroduce its learning to school, we will reintroduce concerts to television, and through this education we will no longer need to sell greyish music by-products," he said.
Certainly, there are things in classical music education that remain very communist, that everywhere, is something very militarized.
It depends on this discipline if we compare a musician with a soldier, or if we form a musician who will sing to an instrument, being, first of all, a musician.
We're talking about a completely different education, if we want to form a soldier (this education - n.red.) it has to be in some way, if we want to form a musician, it's completely different.
“What do you think is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician?” asked the French artist, smiling.
Grimal points out that, for artists, the reward of another way of making music comes precisely from exceeding this status of “soldier,” exceeding what “they think are their limits”: “Musicians discover at some point that they are not soldiers, and that’s why they come out smiling after a concert.”
David Grimal talked about the project or musical and about his vision of music and the artist in the "Ideals Festival", a discussion with the public organized at the George Enescu International Festival by the Aspen Romania Institute.
Profile of David Grimal

Cinema City is looking for "Little Big Voices"
Cinema City launches the biggest challenge for children: dubbing two characters from the super-production "Chrysis Z<0xC4><0x83>pezii 3D"
Do you have a super talented and spontaneous child who likes movies?
Give her a chance to become a star.
In September, as part of the newest campaign dedicated to enthusiastic and ambitious children who want to reach future stars and who are between 8 and 16 years old, Cinema City is looking for "Little Big Voices", giving them an extraordinary opportunity to duplicate two characters from a famous animated film.
If in the classic drawings the emphasis was on approaching the voice of the actor to the specifics of the animated character, lately, the creation of the story takes into account and those who are to interpret the voices, and they are usually well-known actors.
Cinema City Romania, however, wants to discover new voices and that is why we are launching an unprecedented campaign.
We want to find the right voice and challenge parents to enroll their children in our contest.
They will have a special experience, because the characters are sympathetic and the replicas are funny.
“Children will have fun and have a real chance to be part of a team of actors,” said Ioana Ionescu, Marketing Manager at Cinema City Romania.
In the first stage of the competition, between September 11 and September 30, Cinema City will organize a pre-selection following which will be selected 10 children (five girls and five boys) who will have the opportunity to give a try in a recording studio with professionals.
All parents have to do is access the platform micilevocimari.cinema-city.ro, where to enroll the child in the contest and prepare him for the voice test.
Next, you have to choose one of the four films available on the platform, download the texts that the child is about to read, and then the child will record playing his own version of the duplicate.
Four films about friendship, bass heroes, magic and hope can choose competitors to support the test: "Yellow 3D Pene", "Mune: The Guardian of the Moon 3D", "Blinky Bill: Koala the Known 3D" and "Maya 3D Pink".
In the end, the two most talented children (a girl and a boy) will see their dreams come true and will double a character in the superproduction "The Snow Queen - C<0xC4><0x83>riasa Z<0xC4><0x83>pezii 3D", which will premiere in Romania in November of this year.
FedEx earnings are mixed, fiscal forecasts for 2016 fall
FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter, with the delivery giant cutting profit estimates for the whole year as a result of low demand for transportation services and increased costs for its ground transportation division.
The company also said it intends to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
In the same period last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
The company’s shares fell by about 2.5% in pre-market trading, 45 minutes before Wednesday’s opening bell.
FedEx Corp. said it expects to earn between <0x24>10.40 and <0x24>10.90 for the fiscal year ending in May next year, 20 cents less, according to a previous estimate.
Analysts estimated the figure to be <0x24>10.84, according to a survey conducted by FactSet.
The declining estimate comes despite an average price increase of 4.9%, with entry into force on 4 January and higher overheads for land transport of large or heavy packages, which will apply from November.
The company said it is still expected to increase profits over the previous year as a result of lower costs, higher revenues and the development of online commerce.
President and CEO Fred Smith said: “The firm is facing a considerably weaker economic situation than expected, especially in terms of global production and trade.”
The holiday hiring plans were announced a day after the UPS competitor said it plans to hire 90,000-95,000 additional workers, roughly the same number of jobs it did last year.
In the quarter ending August 31, FedEx earned <0x24>692 million, 6% more than the previous year.
Earnings per share were <0x24>2.42, below an average estimate of <0x24>2.44 per share made by 12 analysts who responded to the survey conducted by Zacks Investment Research.
Profit grew by 5%, to <0x24>12.3 billion.
Six analysts who participated in the Zacks survey estimated the amount of <0x24>12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit in recent years by a decline in international priority transport, which has led to a stagnation in the revenues recorded by its Express unit.
But the explosion in online shopping has skipped the results of the FedEx Ground division.
In the last quarter, ground revenues increased by 29%, but operating revenues stagnated due to higher costs for large packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded an increase in revenues due to higher basic tariffs, while the revenues recorded by the freight division decreased due to rising costs.
At pre-market trading, about an hour before the opening sound, FedEx shares fell by <0x24>3.85 or 2.5% to <0x24>150.15.
Tuesday’s closing was down 11% year-on-year and 17% from the record high on June 11.
On the occasion of the most anticipated meeting in recent years, policy-makers in the Federal Reserve will spend two days this week around a 27-foot Honduras mahogany table to decide whether it’s time to raise a key rate of interest for the first interest rate.
Above them, at the end of the sitting room of the central bank, will be seen a mural of the United States.
The map is intended to remind that Janet L. Yellen, the President of the Fed, and his colleagues must put the nation’s economic interests above all else.
The Central Bank has received a double task from Congress: to maximize the employment rate in the United States and maintain price stability.
But since the big economic crisis, the Fed leaders have confirmed that there is a third unwritten task: financial stability.
And this third task could be factor X in a too difficult to anticipate decision, which will be announced on Tuesday, and which will determine whether the U.S. economy is ready to be detached from the unprecedented incentive offered by the near-zero short-term interest rate of 2008 in force.
Although most data indicates a strong growth economy, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could frighten already cautious Fed officials from adding volatility by increasing the reference rate to federal funds – even by only a quarter percentage point.
“Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the first and main aspects that they will pursue,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the interest rate, the growing uncertainty in the global market is enough to give them arguments to wait,” she said.
There is no consensus on the decision the Fed will make, which in itself causes instability in the financial market.
Approximately half of Bloomberg’s recently surveyed economists anticipated an interest rate increase this week.
But financial markets are expected to delay the Fed, a key indicator showing that the probability of growth is only 30%.
This would indicate a downturn on the stock market if the Fed raises the interest rate, unless policymakers would mitigate the strike by promising that it would take a long time until the next rise.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16.599.85.
The move was triggered by expectations that the Fed’s decision-makers will keep interest rates stable this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group.
“It would be surprising if the Fed raise interest rates at this point,” Lonski said.
If the Fed’s decision-makers do this, “they should act deeply in their policies to avoid panic in financial markets.”
Other experts said an increase in the interest rate would calm financial markets as it would remove uncertainty about the moment the Fed will act.
Just a month ago, the Fed appeared to be on track to increase the rate by 0.25% this month, the first small step towards slow tightening monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the US recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that he expected an interest rate rise this year despite the liberals’ high objections that more economic progress would be needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, growth in the labour market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest percentage in more than seven years and close to the level considered by the Fed as total employment.
Salary gains have shown signs of growth.
And although inflation continued to fail to meet the central bank’s annual target, the Fed decision-makers claimed that a key reason was the temporary effect of the oil prices falling sharply.
The economy “may face higher rates and need them, given the labor market tensions,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But global financial markets began to fall into fibrillation at the end of this month, after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell by 16% below the record high in May, as investors feared that the slowdown of the Chinese economy would slow global growth.
The market rebounded somewhat this month, with the Dow index now at around 10% below the May high.
For the Fed decision-makers, market turmoil is added to the complex calculation of the moment of interest rate rise.
“Without what has happened in the financial markets and the news of the weakening of the Chinese economy in recent weeks, it would be firmer during the meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, an experienced researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Fed.
Now, he predicts that they will wait at least a month to better manage the effects.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the U.S. economy and they have almost no data to base on subsequent events in China," Oliner said.
The well-being of the global economy is not one of the major interests of the Fed, so it should practically not be taken into account in decision-making.
In reality, the Fed has become the world monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the central bank has been enormous.
In 2013, President Ben S. Bernanke’s simple hint that the Fed could “stop” its monetary expansion triggered an earthquake in global markets.
In a world where markets and economies are more and more crowded, it is expected that Fed officials will not only monitor progress in other areas, but also consult with other central banks and experts to better interpret the world economy.
His decision-making process is “more art than science,” said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy department at Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., said this month that “Fed has a history of oversized reaction to changes in the financial market that seem to have nothing to do with economic bases.”
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Commission, a decision-making body that supported the increase in interest rates, offered as an example the 1998-99 decisions.
A financial crisis that affected Asia prompted the Fed to reduce the reference rate by 0.75% in three meetings, “despite the implications with limited identification for U.S. development,” Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed officials returned to the declines.
The Fed should put the issue of financial stability first only in the event of a major crisis, such as the 2008 market quake, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England interest rate setting committee.
The recent turbulent period is not even far up to that level, he said.
“We certainly don’t want to get into the situation of fearing an increase in interest rates because the markets are upset,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act continues to hold the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability and, until something changes in this regard, I do not think it should take premature action.

Seven's Sunrise dominates polls, despite attempts by channel Nine to broadcast on Today Show about changing party leadership
The urgent move of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to report on the consequences of the changes from the Liberal Party leadership did not bring a significant increase in the audience for Today.
The morning broadcast of Channel Nine aired from the capital after Tony Abbott was defeated by Malcolm Turnbull.
The rival Sunrise show, moderated by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was captured in London as part of a series of broadcasts over the course of a few weeks, which included Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This “crossover” of the distance didn’t seem to count too much for Aussie TV viewers, Sunrise having an audience of 397,000 in the five capital cities, compared to Today with 339,000.
Today recorded a slight increase compared to Monday’s (317,000) and Tuesday’s (283,000) audiences, but the figures were lower than last Thursday’s (343,000).
Today has diminished the difference from Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had an average audience of 318,000 and Sunrise of 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference varied between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far, in September, Sunrise has an average audience of 349,000 and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that has happened throughout the morning.
This morning, Parliament is not the only one affected by the current change!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for the question!

The main news was the amazing debut of the 800 Words series, starring former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama, having the subject of a recently widowed father, who decides to move with his two children on the coast of New Zealand, had a very impressive average audience of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics were wondering if Thomson was able to cope with a show alone, without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The results of last night’s hearing answered “yes.”
The X Factor show broadcast by Seven remained in position, with 1,136 million viewers, taking the lead on The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven recorded ups and downs on the second night he broadcast The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour (17:00 to 17:30) of Andrew O'Keefe's new, moderate-general culture show had an average of 446,000 spectators.
The second half hour (17:30 to 18:00) rose to 623,000 spectators – enough for a small victory in front of Eddie McGuire’s show, Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half-hour of the show The Chase Australia had an average audience of 520,000 and the second half recorded a huge figure of 720,000.
Hot Seat had an average audience of 620,000.
Chase Australia’s second night’s audience drop will give Nine silent confidence that Hot Seat will eventually triumph at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaces Million Dollar Minute, a show that failed to beat McGuire's show.

Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss the rights of homosexuals
In 2003, Mikhail Hodorkovski, Russia’s richest man, was arrested under gun threat at an airport in Siberia.
Because it provoked President Vladimir Putin to open up, Hodorkovski was convicted, his oil company, Yukos, was confiscated and his pro-democracy efforts were diminished.
Four people lost their lives after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets in the crowd demonstrating against the country’s proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
Violence occurred on Tuesday evening in Rupandehi district, about 280 km west of the capital Kathmandu.
According to the statements of Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the head of district police, more than 1,000 protesters gathered in front of a police department, some of whom threw stones and molotov cocktails.
Dhakal said police used tear gas after which they fired in the air before resorting to the use of rubber bullets.
According to him, twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but are usually used as a less lethal alternative, caused so many deaths.
The clash was the latest after weeks of violent protests in the southern region of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group claim that the new provinces established under the new constitution would share their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal, where the Tharus ethnic group wants its own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 policemen, were killed in the violent clashes triggered on August 10.
When four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces – a major step towards a new constitution but an extremely controversial issue in Nepal, a centrally governed country for hundreds of years.
The process of drafting a new constitution was started in 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April.
This week, in Kathmandu, lawmakers voted on the provisions of the draft constitution and officials said the new charter could be adopted on Sunday.
We will not use wire fences, dogs, policemen and weapons
The Prime Minister continues the exchange of responses with the Hungarian authorities.
At the opening of the government meeting on Wednesday, Ponta reiterated Romania’s firm position on the refugee crisis.
We make every effort to manage the refugee crisis, all institutions have a coordinated opinion.
Romania does not agree and will not apply anti-democratic measures, guard dogs, wire fences or policemen with weapons.
"It is a shame for 21st century Europe to apply methods from the 1930s," said Victor Ponta.
"The prime minister also said that all the dates and details of the refugee crisis will be discussed and set at the CSAT meeting on Thursday," the prime minister concluded.
NHC announces 60% chance of cyclone south of Cape Verde Islands
A broad low-pressure front about 560 km south of the southernmost point of the Cape Verde Islands has a 60% chance of turning into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure front about half the distance between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles also has a 60% chance of a tropical cyclone forming in the next two days, the Miami meteorologist added.
Weight Loss Surgery Could Be Useful in Diabetics With Mild Obesity
The benefits of weight loss surgery in people with mild obesity with type 2 diabetes may persist for at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still premature to say whether diabetics with mild obesity live longer after weight loss surgery than those who follow non-surgical treatments.
“It takes a long time to centralize data on mortality,” said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a specialist in obesity surgery, as she wrote an article about the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss surgeries, also called bariatric surgery, use various methods to reduce the stomach.
They reduce the sensation of hunger and limit the body’s ability to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proven effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted on people with mild obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
IMC, a unit of weight relative to height, is considered normal in the range of 18.5-24.9.
The IMC value of at least 25 indicates that a person is overweight and people with IMC over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your IMC by accessing: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at Taiwan’s Min-Sheng General Hospital used the data collected after 2007 in a trial comparing two types of bariatric surgery – gastric bypass and gastric clottomy – in the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in people with mild obesity.
The mean IMC in people who underwent surgical intervention decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in the study.
In the meantime, IMC in people who received non-surgical treatments against diabetes remained close to the same level, namely 29.
Of those who underwent surgery, diabetes was fully cured at 36% and partially at 28%.
In the group treated by medical methods, by comparison, diabetes was completely cured in only 1% and partially in only 2% of subjects.
In addition, blood pressure control, triglycerides and “bad” LDL cholesterol “were generally better in the surgical group,” the authors concluded.
The researchers also monitored blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood glucose over time.
Researchers write that the optimal level of hemoglobin A1c is below 7%.
After surgery, the mean level of hemoglobin A1c decreased from about 9% to about 6%.
However, in the group treated by medical methods, it remained at about 8%.
But this improved "glycemic control" - reflected by improved levels of hemoglobin A1c - did not reduce mortality by five years, according to chief researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results associated with the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, compared to the group with gastrectomy in the sleeve, the group with bypass surgery lost more weight (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), recorded more significant decreases in CMI (7.4 vs. 5.1), and the group had a more likely A1c, a more likely 16%, and a more complete A1c (3.1% vs. 14.2 kg).
Although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study conducted in high-weight people in Sweden that surgical intervention prolongs life, says Blackstone, of the University of Arizona, Faculty of Medicine - Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery were about 29% less likely to die after 15 years, compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not indicate a survival benefit in patients undergoing surgery, Blackstone stated that it is an optimistic aspect for people with IMC under 35 interested in the procedure.
“This is the point where this work is critical because it claims that this surgery is safe in the lower IMC group,” without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, she says.
Blackstone added that patients and their doctors should start taking weight seriously when the patient's IMC reaches 27-30.
“I think we wait too long until we encourage people to take this issue seriously,” she said.
I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes that shortened their bodies predisposing them to obesity and diabetes, it’s extremely difficult to get back to normal.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe could not welcome all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has called for an end to the violence in the refugee homelands.
The Dalai Lama spoke about the current issue of the refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethics studies, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He said that in the present situation, the interests of humanity should prevail over the interests of every nation and even every continent.
He also stressed that, while admirably, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is inadequate for the situation.
“It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe,” he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria to cope with the crisis, he stressed that it is only a temporary solution.
“It’s a great concern for a few thousand refugees, but at the same time we need to think about long-term solutions to bring peace and sincere development, especially through education, in Muslim countries,” he said.
Basically, we need to think about ways to reduce crime in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The force has never solved these problems," he added.
Referring to the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush’s actions following the September 11 terrorist attacks, stating that the US’ violent response has generated a chain of uncontrollable events.
After the events of September 11, I sent my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him to solve this problem without resorting to violence.
I know his motives were strong, but he used force and generated unexpected consequences,” the Dalai Lama said.
Increasing the number of children who have ingested hand detergent in the last 4 years
According to the Georgia Anti-Intoxication Center, U.S. anti-intoxication centers have reported an increase of about 400% since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallowed a high-alcoholic hand detergent.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Anti-Intoxication Center in Georgia, cases of hand detergent intake in children under the age of 12 reported at anti-intoxication centers rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014.
“Children have more frequent access to these products, and unfortunately, one percent of them go to the emergency room,” Lopez told CNN.
Lopez said that some children are deliberately drinking detergent and others are doing it to impress their friends or to respond to social media challenges.
You can watch movies on YouTube that show teens drinking detergent to create cheap drinks.
Teenagers seem to have mixed the mouthwash with alcohol to get a stronger drink.
Younger children can be attracted by the attractive smell of the detergent.
“A child doesn’t think he’s hurting them,” says Lopez.
Many of the most attractive types (hand detergents) are the perfumed ones.
Hand detergents with the aroma of strawberries, grapes, oranges are the most attractive for children.
The hand detergent contains about 45-95% alcohol.
Especially in young children, only a few swallows can cause alcohol poisoning.
"It's very concentrated alcohol," Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the anti-intoxication center at Kansas University Hospital, told the Fox 4 channel in Kansas City.
Thus, we avoid leaving a glass of whiskey on the table, but people leave these hand detergents in accessible places and if the little ones reach them, this is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested the equivalent of four hand detergents with strawberry flavor, came to the emergency room to receive treatment.
He had alcoholism179, twice the threshold at which an adult is legally considered under the influence of alcohol, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah was blunt and could not walk when he arrived in the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital to identify signs of brain damage as the girl fell and hit her head because of alcohol, Ritchey said.
“It was terrifying,” Ortora Scott, Nhaijah’s mother, told CNN.
It could have been fatal to him.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use wet products or napkins without alcohol and not to leave the hand detergent within reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some detergents have been associated with death.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing a hand detergent containing an undeclared toxic ingredient.
Health authorities have assumed that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, specified as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth graders in northern New York plotted to poison their “bad” teacher by “putting antibacterial products into the class,” according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand detergent and banned him from his classroom.
The police considered the plan to be “unsigned” and referred the disciplinary issue to the school inspector.

Griffiths dismantles rumors of misunderstandings
There have been rumors about Celtic’s misunderstandings, dismantled by the Griffiths, which insisted that he and his team should not be subjected to increased pressure as they prepare to face Dutch league leaders.
I don’t think we feel the pressure, I think the players can’t wait.
The absence of Scots in the title race bores the Dutch - by Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch international Ronald de Boer said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic - because they don't fight for the title with the Rangers.
De Boer, the current Ajax ambassador, said: “In the Netherlands I no longer transmit the summaries of Celtic matches; why?”
Because there's no Rangers in there.
It's not just the return of the Rangers.
We're talking about the old firm.
We talk about both teams together and that’s where the interest is directed.
The tension is high in Old Firm games and not only the Scots want to see these games.
I'll change the situation, Deila promises.
RONNY DEILA accepted that Celtic was fighting back, but the Norwegian chief promised to change the situation.
The defeat with Malmo and the subsequent elimination of the Champions League were followed by the defeat against Aberdeen who played in 10 people, now in the top of the rankings with a five-point lead.
But Deila said: “The Celtics have had periods before and will return.”
We want to get out of this situation as soon as possible.
I know it’s very frustrating and many people are extremely angry or sad about what’s going on.
We feel the same way, but we have to move on.
We need the support of Celtic because that’s how the players get better.
It is very important that we remain united now.
Warburton’s prudence regarding January transfers
Despite comments just a few weeks ago suggesting that he would have identified some targets for the January transfers, Rangers chief Mark Warburton is cautious when it comes to transfers, insisting that he does not want to affect the Ibrox team's unit.
The former chief of Brentford said: “The January transfer period is very different from the summer.”
In the case of players transferring summer, there is the pre-season period in which they can be integrated, which you could have noticed this season in our group.
The team is doing very well.
Sometimes you do more harm if you bring players that are not needed.
Celtic targets Michu after retreat
Swansea striker Michu, who was associated with Celtic during the transfer period, suggested that he might withdraw on the expiration of his contract with Swans.
The 29-year-old struggled for two years with ankle problems and failed to leave Wales this summer.
Hearts faces SFA over Neilson's comments
Hearts led by 2-1 when Paterson was eliminated and they lost by 3-2, but the bottom red card was then cancelled – the third red card in eight months.
Neilson maintains his statements, insisting: “I have not questioned integrity, I have not commented on performance.”
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The invincible Hibee was kidnapped after admitting he sang a song with offensive verses about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in March 2014 at a pub in the Roseburn region of Edinburgh ahead of a derby with Edinburgh in Tynecastle.
"It was the derby and it was the enthusiasm of the moment," said the striker, adding: "I don't have to say I'm not going back to Tynecastle unless I play for Celtic."
Tannadice Council trusts management Dundee United - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists that the Dundee United board still trusts that the management team will change the situation — but agrees that the downturn on the ground must end.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We'll bring the boys back in shape," Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy for ‘dirty win’ against Hamilton
Derek McInnes acknowledges that the Aberdeen team must despair from Hamilton Acces to get their seventh consecutive league victory, which brought them five points in front of Celtic due to the penalty kick from Adam Rooney's first reprise.
McInnes said: “There is no team that has won anything, in the cup or league, and that hasn’t won games like that.”
Unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged while in the UK rises
The unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged, with 164,000 in the May-July period, while the number of unemployed in the UK in total increased by 10,000, reaching 1.82 million in the same period.
The unemployment rate of 5.9% in Scotland was higher than in the UK, at 5.5%, according to figures presented by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
In the meantime, the employment rate in Scotland has fallen by 12,000 over the three-month period, with the number currently being 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell in the quarter to 74.0% - a figure above the average of 73.5 in the UK.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures, said: “The long-term plan of the authorities laid the foundations for a stronger economy.”
It has been almost a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain a part of the UK.
Over the past 12 months, we have seen improvements in the labour market in Scotland, with the employment rate increasing and the unemployment rate dropping.
Why I witnessed an execution in Oklahoma
In the course of today, except for a late legal intervention, I will look at how a man is sentenced to death.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'm going to sit in an observer room at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary's execution room and see how Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation came first in January, through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I accepted.
As the day approaches with the cause, the idea frightens me.
So, why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would give you a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists can be witnesses to executions in America, and because demands usually exceed the number of seats available, there is a massive lottery to decide who will be chosen.
Oklahoma reduced the number of seats reserved for media representatives from 12 to five.
The chosen will look at the execution with impartiality.
I can't do this.
I would sit next to Richard Glossip’s closest friends, in addition I developed my own connection with him over the months of telephone conversations and a visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like the guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
Penitentiary authorities say I can’t be a witness and a journalist, so I won’t be allowed to have a notebook and a pixel to note what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
An Oklahoma journalist accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the story of the detainee as he wishes, get access.
I cried to her.
He admitted that he "could have formulated better", but he still thinks I'm wrong.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write and I wouldn't even do it if he asked me.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list at any time.
However, he wants to have an international report on the subject.
He believes that if he dies, advertising will help the movement against capital punishment.
Kim Bellware, a reporter at the Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about the case, listen to the series of multimedia files that we have made.
I'm not going to come back here on all the details.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese make him guilty of complicity.
But I think he's very likely not to be guilty of murder.
I believe with certainty that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And I'll look at him dying from this perspective.
I can't pretend I'm totally objective.
For this, you can read articles written by other reporters.
From me you will find out what it's like to watch a man I like die uselessly.
Peter Moody claims stewarts tried to spy on him and threatens to withdraw from the race
Peter Moody said Racing Victoria stewards either tried to infiltrate a spy on his grass last year and threatened to withdraw immediately from the race.
He launched an attack on the Stewarts and the integrity department of Racing Victoria, claiming that they are conducting a personal campaign against him, the drop that filled the glass being the removal of Lady Tata from the race due to a treatment administered on the day of the race.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he’s always tried to do what’s best for the course and that he’s put in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive result of the Lidari cobalt test, for which he has no explanation.
For 18 months, she swallowed her words about the statements about spies and did not want to resemble the "wolf who does not reach grapes".
“I wasn’t going to say anything about that and I’ve been silent for a long time, but sometimes you get to such a high level of frustration that everything suddenly fades away,” Moody said.
It is known to have continued.
Sometimes you react and you have to endure the consequences, and I will have to live with what I have stated.
Tonight I'm going home and I'm going to sleep quietly.
I want to go upside-down and I want the owners with whom I collaborate to see that you are trying to give them all the best.
From the moment they start to think that this is not the case, I have to give up the coaching job.
At that point, I'll have to think about what I'm going to do with my certification.
Earlier, Moody threw the bomb in an interview for racing.com in which he said the integrity department had tried to spy on his gravel.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room next to a man - whose name I'll tell him if I'm asked - and offered to hire him at my barns to provide information about the activity from there."
Obviously he considers me a traitor.
If so, then they should all resign because they were incompetent in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former President of RVL, David Moodie, current President of RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, knew at the time and still know today.
Should I think it's personal?
Is it necessary for RVL to start having a spine and can blame people outside of trainers for what’s happening in the industry?
Do I have a bad influence on the industry?
Is my influence on the industry so bad?
Maybe that's how I see the others.
Maybe he needs to take my license and put me aside and I have no doubt that the statements that I am making now might make him think about this option.
I have reached a point where I no longer care, and that saddens me.
It makes me very sad.
I'll put pressure on them and make them make a decision.
My family supports me and I can leave.
The trainer’s frustration grew with the long-standing investigation into cobalt testing in which Lidari was involved, and his elimination led him to claim that he could “put his license on the table.”
Moody, whose name is most often associated with the training of the invincible champion Black Caviar, labeled the day's treatment rule as "ridiculous" after a sludge or clay cataplasm was applied to the legs of horses, which violates the rules.
Breaking the rules of the course.
I have to take full responsibility for this,” he said.
One of my employees accidentally put mud on his leg.
It could've happened last night.
It could have happened yesterday, what happened to it.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody could be disqualified for three months for the treatment from the day of the race consisting of the application of the cataplasma, for which the Stewarts opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
People who do these rules don't know anything about horses.
“We all understand that rules are needed, but it has gone too far,” Moody said.
The driver who hit and escaped from the scene of the accident in Cobram was arrested
Police arrested a man after a collision with a cyclist produced in Cobram over the weekend and followed by a flight from the scene.
The cyclist was transported by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital after being seriously injured after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley highway on Saturday morning.
Police say the driver of the vehicle did not stop to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man surrendered to Shepparton police.
He appears to be accused of escaping from the scene of the accident, not offering first aid and other road crimes.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy answers opponents on wrestling charges.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy called the criticism of his team’s plating tactics “denaturated subjects” brought into discussion the top two favourites in the NRL.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed the Storm players to "take over" the team in Storm's nervously won match in the qualifying final played Friday night in Sydney.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made an easy reference to Storm after his team's victory in the qualifying game with the North Queensland Cowboys, played on Saturday night, when he called the match a "demonstration" of the pre-sepland league and declared the "queens" to be the "queens".
Bellamy jumped into defending his team’s tactics of plating and said the players were simply focused on “contact” when they plated.
Bellamy says he gained confidence after two important coaches criticized his team, which means they were worried that Storm would beat him.
"And things don't stop here - I didn't hear Trent Robinson complaining about wrestling when they beat us 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven’t changed anything in our defensive systems or techniques all year long, only that in the last six weeks we’ve really put the emphasis on contact in the plates and so we’ve changed the situation.
Trent has been in this role for three years and obviously has a wonderful team so he probably isn’t used to losing and it was a shock to him.
We appreciate how it always happens at this time of year.
Bellamy contradicted Bennett's idea of "animating football", reminding his mentor St. George-Illawarra Dragons of Bennett won the championship in 2010 by playing soccer "politician".
Wayne talks about palpitating football.
"He argued his opinion by comparing his game on Saturday night with our game on Friday night and talked about how exciting the game was," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010, St George received a lot of criticism because he was a boring team and Wayne said he didn’t care about how black he was under his nail.
But now he has a team that can play what I think is exciting football, especially because of the fast-paced young midfielders.
This kind of game you want to do when you have such players.
He brought this argument in 2010, now he wants everyone to adopt his style of play - not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to be able to play that way.
Mie gives me more confidence because they say these things because they are somewhat concerned about the game with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn’t think about us when they were thinking about important games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the match between Storm and Roosters was a sharper score-related defeat compared to the match between Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably a good game, I haven't seen it yet, how much was the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, in our game there were two more attempts, that means palpitating game?
Or does it mean pausing and not marking?
For me there are plans.
If they're talking about us, it means that at some point we could meet them.
Storm is free this weekend as they have won the right to play at home either with the North Queensland Cowboys or with the Cronulla Sharks, at the end of next Saturday's preliminary at AAMI Park, the tickets are on sale starting Tuesday morning.
Stevan Hogg used girls’ phones to encourage pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for pictures of abused children.
Stevan Hogg took the girl’s phone while she was sleeping and then logged in to an online messaging service where another user sent her a series of indecent images with children as the subject.
The girl then woke up and noticed the disappearance of the phone, which she found in Hogg’s hand while he was sleeping.
He looked at the phone and found the disturbing messages after which he immediately alerted his mother.
After arriving, the police looked at the five photos and then analyzed the computers found at the address and found "concerning" searches on the Internet using terms to find inappropriate images with child subjects.
Hogg claimed that he did so to "attract pedophiles" on the Internet before "since he's a policeman to frighten them".
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee court: "He has stated that it is an addiction - that it is dependent on scaring people.
He admitted that he did the computer searches but said he did it because he wanted to be a cop to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about the conversations he had with the stranger who sent him the pictures and about the fact that he asked him to send him other photos.
He said he did it to breathe.
He said he no longer thinks clearly when he drinks and that he wants to see pictures of rapes and murders.
Robertson added: “When the girl found the messages on the phone, she yelled at her mother and trembled and cried.
The girl saw the indecent images on the phone and the accused was confronted.
The girl was interviewed and told that the accused used the computer and the PlayStation to talk to girls who seemed much younger than him.
Last year, on June 14, Hogg, 23, domiciled in Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to the allegations that he took or took indecent pictures of children, and violated the conditions of conditional release on January 25th this year and did not appear on March 24th this year.
Attorney General Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to be registered in the sex offender’s register because it could be claimed that the crime “did not involve a significant sexual aspect.”
Judge Alistair Carmichael has postponed the sentence until October, for reasons of social reports.
Hogg was released on bail in this case but remained in custody prior to appearances for other cases.
He was transferred to the sex offender's register before he was convicted.
President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, delivered the wrong speech in Parliament
Earlier this year, Mr. Mugabe, the oldest African leader, fell on the steps of a podium.
He was not injured, however, filming the crash became viral on social media.
The opening of the parliamentary session was also disturbed by opposition representatives who said they had received anonymous death threats, threatening them not to escape Mugabe in any way during his speech.
Last month, he was evacuated during his speech in Parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The head of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) parliamentary group, Innocent Gonese, said seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones, warning them not to disturb Mugabe's speech.
“The message was sent by a hidden number but is called ‘death’,” he told reporters after Mr. Mugabe’s speech.
It warns the MPs in question that immunity applies only to Parliament and once they leave Parliament, parliamentary immunity is no longer valid.
The head of the parliamentary group said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is "concerned" about the threats transmitted to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to make 30,000 releases
Hewlett-Packard is expected to make between 25,000 and 30,000 releases as part of the company’s restructuring and cost reduction efforts in the service sector.
This year, HP will split into two companies, separating the computer and printer division from the company’s growing hardware and services operations.
Expected availability will bring costs of around <0x24>2.7 billion starting in the fourth quarter, HP said.
“These restructurings will bring the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise a more competitive and cost-sustainable structure,” said Meg Whitman, president and CEO of HP, who will lead the unit after the breakup.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP at the moment and will hold a broad portfolio of businesses that will contribute to the company’s transition to a new business style,” Whitman said.
Working as a separate company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the growing demands of our customers worldwide.
According to a statement from the company, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenues of more than <0x24>50 billion and “focus on providing unrivalled integrated solutions” to companies.
A company founded in 1930 by graduates of Stanford University, Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, aimed at the production of electrical equipment and whose Palo Alto garage was called the “Silicon Valley bed”.
HP has undergone a massive reorganization to adapt to the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
The measure taken by HP, the world’s second-largest computer manufacturer and one of the largest technology companies in the US, is the latest in the field, based on the idea that companies that focus better in a direction have better performance.
FriendsFest: the comedy series that taught us important lessons about friendship between men
The absence of similar characters in the series is obvious, given that the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever, with suicide rates among young men peaking in the last 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the leading cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK, and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an attempt to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) designated 2015 as the Year of the Man, wanting to question the culture that prevents men from asking for help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the struggle for the success of this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is surrounded by enough friends “with a healthy mood,” his chances of recovery doubled.
Similarly, for people who are not depressed, a circle of healthy mental friends reduces the likelihood of mental disorders by half.
Of course, in order for friendship to have an effect, it must first be accessible.
In this era of social media-dominated communication, where the emphasis is on style and not substance, the immediate nature of the response often prioritises contact with meaning.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to create the appearance of a strong personality, open to fun and success, even though in reality isolation is the one that dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the cost of intrinsic values—our inner desire for personal development and friendship—which affects our mental health even more deeply.
The billionaire inventor of a video game recently explained that money does not actually buy happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was that it focused its attention on this idea.
The characters were not defined by the workplace but by their own personality, which they showed by interacting as friends.
The humor of Joey and Chandler’s frequent hugs, the moments of watching football in comfortable chairs and Ross’ passion for Rachel came from knowing that men can be associated with this situation, even if they often venture to fully explore their feelings.
As one social worker explained to me: “My role of listening to suicidal and depressed people showed how even the slightest interactions with friends can make a difference.”
Often, people who appeal to us do not feel able to talk to friends.
The old saying to deal with yourself is strong, as is the feeling of being perceived as a weak person if you speak openly about problems.
Friends is one of the series that comes to mind when I try to offer several long-term psychological adaptation mechanisms.
The series highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
As much as objective, external intervention helps, through the phone, people arriving in times of despair, long-term support comes from family and close friends.
So, if you’re participating in this weekend at FriendsFest organized by Comedy Central, with a full set of filming plates to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends to a coffee in Central Perk.
Or, better yet, if you see someone on Starbucks alone, smile and say hello.
You never know what a difference your friendship could make.
Friends is broadcast by Comedy Central from start to finish - all 236 episodes - on the occasion of <0x23>FriendsFest
Di Maria marks and helps PSG give Malmo away
Angel Di Maria celebrates alongside Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored in his debut match in the Champions League on Tuesday and helped PSG get ahead of Swedish team Malmo.
Below we present you the game history and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani did their job, Paris Saint-Germain starting the Champions League series, with a calming 2-0 victory against Malmo in the game played on Tuesday at Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored in less than four minutes from the start of his debut match in the Champions League in the PSG team, bringing the French champions in the lead although they missed a number of occasions before securing their lead with Cavani's goal in the 61st minute.
Arriving in Group A alongside Real Madrid and Shahtior Donetsk, Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions because the goal of the French team is not only to qualify in the optimal but also to improve the route to the quarterfinals in each of the last three rounds.
But even though they scored, Laurent Blanc’s students were far from a perfect picture, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic wasting the chance of a goal after which he was replaced by the team in his hometown and the club he started his brilliant career in 1999.
“It’s not easy to win at home or on the move in the Champions League, so a 2-0 victory creates problems for our opponents and makes a comfortable difference to the next ranks, even if there are still things we need to improve throughout the season,” Blanc said.
It's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we did, although I’m sorry we didn’t manage to score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after injury to one of the three team changes in Paris, with a 2-2 draw from Bordeaux home in League 1 this weekend, but Di Maria took over the light of the spotlights in the fourth minute.
Last month, when he was transferred from Manchester United, the Argentine midfielder was named the man who will take PSG to the next level in Europe and demonstrated this when he squeezed at Marco Verratti’s pass behind Malmo’s defense before hitting the incredibly highway over Johan Wiland’s long hillside.
But if someone expected PSG to win by kicking their fingers, they were disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in the play-off to get to this stage and entered the field with nine national team titles, with a defense of five men and two defensive midfielders, was a strong opponent.
But their attack was not impressive, with the exception of Nikola Djurdjic, who passed the post of Kevin Trapp in the 34th minute.
Instead, PSG players slowed down the pace several times, giving some unnecessary passes and unfinished interventions, even Ibrahimovic who missed no less than five attempts in the first round and was then replaced by Cavani even after the game resumed.
Ibrahimovic, however, proved to be much more skilled in supporting his colleagues, with his pass being the one that Di Maria sent in a whistle-blower from Wiland over the gate in the minute 52.
The second goal was scored in a final after an hour of the match, thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan who scored the sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic passed away from Maxwell.
This goal eliminated Malmo’s hope that they would rebalance the score and only a superb stop from Wiland’s distance for David Luiz’s rejection maintained the final score before Ezequiel Lavezzi’s new entry canceled a goal in the extensions.
Norwegian team coach Age Hareide later said that PSG had been with a class over and that “the last game I played in the Champions League was in December last year.”
Since then, we have only played in the league in Sweden, which does not rise to the same level.
Qualifications are not enough.
Put your hat down for PSG.
They did an excellent game.
Glencore raises <0x24>2.5 billion in stock sales
Swiss mining giant Glencore, hit by a drop in commodity stock prices, raised <0x24>2.5 billion in stock sales as part of a massive debt reduction plan.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, said it had sold new shares worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion to pay off its debt.
After losing 57% of its market value this year, the company is taking sides with the falling prices on the commodity exchange, as China’s decline in economic activity affects demand and causes a market disaster.
The preferential right to subscribe increased the price of Glencore's stocks on the London Stock Exchange in Wednesday morning trades.
Shares rose by 2.77% to 131.60 shillings on the FTSE 100 index, which opened at a 0.69% higher value.
Glencore has unveiled the sale of <0x24>2.5 billion in shares as part of broader plans to cover nearly a third of its <0x24>30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shares at a price of 125 shillings per share, 2.4% less than Tuesday’s closing price.
It took 1.3 billion shares from the company, representing 9.99% of the group.
Concerns about the growth of the Chinese economy in prolonged stagnation led to a substantial increase in iron ore prices by about half, and coal, copper and other commodities fell by 20-40%.
Xi urges broader expansion of the global economy
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with reforming that the economy needs to open up more broadly to the outside world to fuel growth.
"China must commit to attracting foreign investment and expertise and improve opening policies," Xi said at the 16th Meeting of the Central Leading Group for General Continuation of Reforms (Central Leading Group for Deepening Overall Reform).
Promoting openness and encouraging reforms will bring new impetus and vitality and will lead to economic growth, Xi said.
The Governing Group adopted a number of guidelines, including a negative list of market access regulations, relaxing customs control policies, encouraging state-owned enterprises to absorb private capital and reorganizing the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a negative list will be drawn up that will identify the sectors and areas of activity in which investments are not allowed.
The system will be gradually tested and improved through test programs.
According to the statement, the measure is important because it will give the market a more important role in the allocation of resources, ensuring a legislative-based business environment and providing a wider openness to the market.
The state authorities will also weaken control over the powers they delegate to companies, ensuring that these companies decide how to conduct their business.
According to the statement, China will also allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In an attempt to open up state-controlled sectors, more sectors will be open to private investment.
“State authorities will not change their foreign investment policy and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign investment firms and provide better services to them,” the statement said.
In addition, it will be easier for foreign nationals to apply for permanent residence permits or so-called "green cards", optimising requirements and streamlining the process of filing applications.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of the law of practice of lawyers and the education of judges and prosecutors.
Prime Minister Li Keqiang and leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also attended the meeting, according to a statement made after the meeting.
Educational unions dissatisfied with the government’s proposal to increase wages by 10%
Negotiations between Prime Minister Victor Ponta and the leaders of the education unions have not reached any results, the government is proposing a 10% wage increase from 1 December, with pay on 1 January 2016, and the unions wanted a 15% increase from November, or a 20% increase from December.
The discussions took place at Victoria Palace on Tuesday evening, with the Prime Minister accompanied by the Minister of Education, Sorin Cimpeanu, the Minister of Finance, Eugen Teodorovici and the Minister of Labour, Rovana Plumb.
The proposal of today’s government did not satisfy us, otherwise we would not have been in a position to summon the leaders of our federations.
The 10 percent that was promised to us today is for us less than we expected.
"In fact, these 10 percent are the money we have stipulated in our agreement with the government last year for 2016," said Anton Hadar, President Alma Mater, at the end of the talks.
In the future, health and education will be the areas in which we will invest all the money we have
According to him, on Thursday, there will be a meeting of the FSLI, which will also be attended by representatives of the Government to present to the representatives of the confederations of the country the proposal for wage increase, I follow the unionists to decide whether to accept the offer of the Executive.
The prime minister also told the unionists that the government was trying to send the Salary Act to Parliament as soon as possible, so that it could enter into force on December 1.
The regulatory act provides for an increase in wages in the educational system by 25% of the total increase of 70%, the expected increase in the document to be completed in the next four years.
Victor Ponta also promised the trade unionists the full payment of the judgments in 2016.
The Immigrant Crisis: Tragedy in the Aegean Sea
At least 22 migrants drowned in Turkey's territorial waters on Tuesday after the ship on which it was located crashed.
Among the victims were 11 women and 5 children, according to Yahoo News.
The boat was in the Aegean Sea and headed for the Greek island of Kos.
Turkey's coast guard said it had managed to rescue 249 people on board the ship, but their nationality is not yet known.
Earlier on Monday, two other people died while trying to cross the Aegean Sea.
Also on the weekend, 34 migrants, including 4 babies and 11 children, drowned off the Greek island of Pharmakonisi, located 15 kilometres off the Turkish coast.
The situation was similar: the ship transported more people than its capacity, so it sank.
The route has become popular lately for immigrants who want to escape the war and the difficult lives of countries such as Syria or Iraq.
More than 100 stewardesses fired because they were too fat
Air India has fired about 130 stewarts and stewardesses because they are overweight, the airline announced at the end of last week.
The state-run company said the decision was taken for security reasons and recent government regulations, but critics say the move is "smiling" and "sexisting," the Washington Post wrote.
The concession at the table is the latest in a ten-year struggle between the company and the more full stewardesses.
The weight limit for these dates back to the 1980s, when Air India began using graphics with the ideal weight and height.
In 2006, Air India dismissed the new stewardess considered "exceptionally overweight", as this fact "may have an effect on reflexes and may prevent the agility necessary to carry out emergency measures".
The stewardesses put the company in trial, won and were re-engaged, but the company fired them again in 2009.
"All efforts to force them to weaken have failed," a spokesman for the company said.

A footballer from Stara gives Gigi Becali lessons about promoting young players.
If the championship's funder decided to close the football academy in which he had invested a considerable sum, Paul Papp Foundation opened a football school.
The "Paul Papp" Academy will operate in the town of Dej, where the villagers are expected to take their first selection.
“I’m extremely happy that I’m at this stage to start the Football Academy that bears my name.
For me, it is extremely important to find talented children who can play football without having to worry about the material at training.
They have to have one concern: to play football as best as possible.
Technical details should not be taken care of.
They have to value their talent.
This is what Paul Papp Football Academy wants to do.
“I am also waiting for Mayor Costan Morar at the first selection of children, to show them that he is with them,” Papp told Dejeanul.ro.
Children up to the age of 11 are expected at the Academy of the Star Foundation.
The whole party wants the government.
PSD interim president Liviu Dragnea said on Tuesday that the whole party wants to remain in government, and if the prime minister wants, the PSD Congress will formalize this decision.
I understand that Mr. Ponta is waiting for this decision from the PSD Congress, everyone wants to go to the government, the whole party.
If we want to formalize it through a decision of Congress, we will do so.
There will be no emotion about this.
"There have been no elements, voices in the party, opinions in the party that would give someone the uncertainty of the government or give the impression that someone in the party does not want the PSD to remain in government, in the current government, with the current prime minister," Dragnea said at the end of the session of the National Permanent Bureau.
The PSD has announced when Congress will do it - what will be decided then
Prime Minister Victor Ponta said on Tuesday that it is important that, at the PSD Congress, beyond the choice of leadership, a clear message should be given if the government is wanted to continue or if the party decides to pass into opposition.
Dragnea: I'll announce Monday if I'm running for Congress
On the other hand, Liviu Dragnea will announce next Monday if she is running for a leadership position in the future Congress.
I will sing on Monday, after the Executive Committee, if the date of the congress is set.
"I will announce whether I will run for a position in the leadership of the party," Dragnea said at the end of Tuesday's session of the National Permanent Bureau of the PSD.
Asked if the hesitation about the announcement of the candidacy has anything to do with his file, Dragnea said she does not have this problem.
I don't have the problem you're referring to, but I think it's fair and honest to all my party colleagues to announce me a nomination at the time the date of Congress is formally set.
"It's the only motivation," Dragnea said.
The vast majority of social-democratic branches proposed an extraordinary PSD Congress on October 11, and the exact date of Congress will be decided by the party’s Executive Committee on Monday.

Italian arrested at Bors Customs with immigrants hidden in TIR
Two Sri Lankan citizens were spotted Monday at Bors Customs while trying to illegally cross the border, hiding in the helm of a self-defense led by an Italian citizen.
Following the investigation, it was determined that the two paid the driver 4,000 euros to be transported to France, the Border Police reported.
At the specific checkpoint, border police officers noticed, in the truck’s cabin, a large travel bag, which contained personal belongings for several people, which is why they carried out a tight check on the means of transport.
On this occasion, border police discovered, hidden in the semi-trailer of the car, among the plastic scraps, two men.
The verifications showed that two men, aged 28, are citizens of Sri Lanka and asylum seekers in Romania.
"In the investigation, the young people stated that they intended to arrive in France, which they contacted with a conational, through which they met with the Italian driver, who offered to transport them to their destination, where he was going to receive 2,000 euros per person," the police said in a statement.
The two migrants were “criminal work under the guise of protecting the crime of attempted fraudulent crossing of the state border.”
Pompeo B., an Italian 45-year-old driving a Renault Magnum brand badge, registered in Romania, carrying plastic cans for a company in Italy, was also detained for 24 hours, after being presented to the Bihor Court with a proposal for preventive arrest.
How satisfied are Romanians in a couple: Men vs. Women
Most Romans are satisfied with their relationships.
This is the conclusion of a study conducted on the occasion of the arrival in Romania of John Gray, the famous author of the bestseller "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus".
A total of 62% of respondents declared themselves “very satisfied” and “satisfied” with the overall quality of their relationship.
"However, 18% appear to be 'unsatisfied' and 'very dissatisfied' in couples' relationships, and another 18% declare 'right'," the study concluded, according to a statement released Tuesday.
The situation is slightly different when the responses of men and women are analyzed separately.
Thus, 28% of men are very satisfied, 39% satisfied, 17% correct, 6% very dissatisfied, and 8% slightly dissatisfied.
For women, 33% declared themselves satisfied, 24% very satisfied, 8% very unhappy, 14% slightly dissatisfied, and 19% chose the right category.
When we look at the degree of satisfaction (positive), we will notice that men are more satisfied.
When it comes to the neutral state (correct), we see a difference of two percent.
"In the very unsatisfied situation, the biggest difference is the slightly unsatisfied response where we see a 6% difference," the statement said.
The study also showed that a quarter of Romanians (26%) spend an hour or even less time together, 18% spend between five and eight hours together, and 45% between two and four hours.
The authors of the study also reported that “Romanians feel the need for something more adventure in their lives (24%), followed by affection (21%), money (21%), safety (20%), new (19%), sex (19%), respect 18%, confidence 17%, pleasure 17%”, connection 17%, knowledge 16%, protection 14%, self-esteem 11%, importance 14%, free control.
The study was conducted by Extreme Training between June 1 and September 1,369 people, with a calculated error margin of 2.6%.
Europe is once again in a humiliation.
German Deputy Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel said on Tuesday that Europe "has become embarrassed" after the failure of the Brussels ministerial meeting on the allocation of refugees within the European Union.
"Tonight (Monday evening), Europe has once again become embarrassed," Sigmar Gabriel, who is also the minister of the economy in the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel, told AFP.
Earlier, German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere suggested reducing the EU’s structural funds in the case of countries that reject refugee quotas.
European Interior Ministers, meeting in Brussels on Monday, failed to reach an agreement on the obligatory allocation of 120,000 refugees, which was requested last week by the European Commission to face one of the most serious migration crises in Europe since 1945.

What Happens to Coach Darren Cahill
Simona Halep is facing a crucial decision for her career as she is forced to choose whether to continue or not to work with coach Darren Cahill.
The two have been working on the Adidas Player Development program this year, the Australian technician being with the romance only at major tournaments.
Simona had only words of praise to Cahill, who appears to be the only coach who has managed to impose himself in front of the caprice of the sport.
Adidas’ program will close by the end of the year, and Halep has to decide whether to offer Cahill a consistent contract or renounce its collaboration.
We don't know exactly what's going to happen.
We talk and see.
"After Singapore I will be able to give an answer," Simona said at a press conference.
Darren Cahill is one of the most expensive coaches in tennis today, demanding a contract of about <0x24>1 million a year.
In addition, the Australian is also a sports commentator, a job he would not want to give up at the moment.
The last meeting Simona and Cahill will work together is the Champions Tournament in Singapore.
It wasn't normal, I wasn't respected
Victor Piturca revealed how he separated from the Romanian national team in the fall of last year.
The former selector confessed that he did not agree with FRF President Razvan Burleanu after he took the place of Mircea Sandu, and thus made the decision to leave the national.
Eventually, he proposed to the Federation chief to substantially raise his salary to stay, but was refused.
I'm not sorry I left the country right now.
Then I was sorry, I left a job behind.
So I thought it was good for me and I think it was good for me.
What happened to me when I was a selector was not normal, I was not respected, my work was not respected.
I worked well with those before the Federation, but when Burleanu came to the Federation he came up with a preconceived idea, he didn’t know me, he learned different opinions from the press about me.
It didn’t change me because it was very difficult at the time, with the results I had, plus it was the financial situation in the middle.
I kept working, everything went very well and he probably changed his mind too.
But I wanted to leave.
If he wanted me to stay, then I offered them a contract extension.
We have around 400 and a few thousand euros a year, then we have around 600 thousand euros.
I didn't talk to Burleanu, but his right hand.
"He agreed, but only if we finished first in the group," Victor Piturca told Dolce Sport.
Victor Piturca resigned from Romanian national team in the fall of last year, although the team had good results in the Euro 2016 preliminaries.
The technician accepted the proposal to train in Saudi Arabia, immediately taking over the group Al Ittihad.
Blinds and water pipes at the border
Hungarian police have deployed Humvee military vehicles equipped with machine guns on the border with Serbia, after the violent clashes of the day on Wednesday, when water and tear gas guns were used against immigrants who wanted to patrol from Serbia, despite the fact that a garrison with a rifles was used.
At least 20 policemen and two children were injured in clashes, Russia Today reports.
Twenty policemen have so far been injured and the ambulance service has taken over two children who were injured after being thrown over the security fence.
"We will rebuild the fence and tighten it and protect Hungary's security by any means," said the Hungarian Prime Minister's Security Adviser, Gyorgy Bakondi.
Police tried to control with water cannons and tear gas the crowd throwing plastic bottles, stones and floor pieces.
Authorities reported that several dozen migrants broke the fence at the crossing between the cities of Roszke and Horgos and managed to patrol the country.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto called on Serbia to take action against "very aggressive" immigrants from the common border.
There are reports that the Serbs have supplemented their police forces at the border.
Following the incidents on Wednesday, Budapest suspended the crossing of the Roszke-Horgos border for 30 days.
Hungary is in a concerted move to close its borders to block access to migrants.
If on Tuesday he announced that in addition to the fence on the border with Serbia, he would raise one to the border with Romania, to the vehement protests of Bucharest on Wednesday, the Hungarian prime minister announced the lifting of a fence and to the border with Croatia.
Rare disease that a man suffers
American Nick Hess was banished by his family as an alcoholic, his wife even filming him when he was drowsy, he could barely stand up and his words were hard to understand.
Although the 35-year-old said he did not drink alcohol, it was visible that he was in a state of drunkenness.
When she first accused me of being drunk, without drinking, I thought she was crazy.
“But friends and family thought ‘maybe he’s drinking alone, he’s an alcoholic in secret’,” he told Mirror.
When he saw his wife's footage with him, the man from Columbus, Ohio, simply didn't recognize: "I looked in my eyes and I wasn't there."
'It was terrible, I didn't remember anything.'
In addition, his wife, who although doubted him for a while, eventually went with him to countless doctors, remembers that Nick's breath smelled alcohol.
The moment that put Nick in mind the most was when, after a minor accident, when he was hit by another car, he discovered that he had alcoholism three times above the legal limit, though he had only consumed one beer the night before.
After years and countless investigations, it was discovered that Nick suffered from an extremely rare disease, "Auto-brewery syndrome".
Practically, your body makes all the carbohydrates consumed ferment, turning into alcohol.
The one who pretended that this might be Nick's disease was actually his wife.
The disease hasn't got a cure yet, but since he quit carbohydrates, Nick hasn't had any such episodes.
A Mercedes with a golfer's cross
A man in South Korea destroyed his car, a Mercedes S63, in protest against the services he had from his dealer.
The man "attacked" his car with a golf cross, causing enough damage to the car to be removed from use, BT reports.
The whole scene was filmed, and the video came on the Internet, to the fun of those who watched it.
The man claimed that the car has defects that put his life and his family at risk.
His anger arose when the dealer from whom he bought the car did not solve his problem, as he agreed.
The government on Wednesday approved the "National Immigration Strategy for the period 2015-2018" and the "Action Plan for the current year", documents considered to be "another stage Romania is taking in its efforts to modernize the immigration management process on the national press territory".
The strategy aims to effectively manage the phenomenon of immigration, including general strategic objectives, specific objectives and action guidelines that reflect policies established at European level, adapted to national realities.
In view of the problems faced by the states in the immediate neighbourhood of Romania, measures are envisaged for the unified and coherent management of situations caused by the possible occurrence of an influx of illegal immigrants on the territory of Romania, generated by situations of political, social, economic or military crisis.
“The Romanian authorities will contribute to the creation of a flexible admission system, but at the same time they will pay particular attention to citizens from countries with potentially migratory or potentially affecting national security,” the source added.
The strategy identifies a number of factors that can influence immigration and asylum, including maintaining the conflict situation in Syria, reactivating the conflict in Iraq, maintaining an unstable situation in the border areas of Romania (Ukraine, Transnistria), continuing and increasing the intensity of the Israeli-Palestinian armed conflict.
On the other hand, the document also sets a number of general strategic objectives related to immigration, such as: promoting legal migration, stricter controls on the legality of the residence of third-country nationals on the territory of Romania and the appropriate application of removal measures and national restrictive measures.
The national strategy also covers specific objectives relevant to the implementation and implementation of the general strategic objectives.
These include: facilitating access on the territory of Romania to third-country nationals who meet the employment needs of the workforce, facilitating access of third-country nationals to higher education institutions in Romania for areas and professions identified as deficits.
Referring to the 2015 Action Plan, the government appreciates that it is "a means to establish concrete activities that lead to the creation of a flexible system to stop the growing migration phenomenon".
Romania, at a European top on the labour market
Latvia, Romania and Bulgaria recorded the largest increase in total labour costs among EU member states in the second quarter of the year, compared to the similar period in 2014, according to data published Wednesday by the European Statistical Office (Eurostat).
The index refers to the expenses of employers’ staff.
Thus, between April and June 2015, the total labour cost rose by 1.9% in the European Union and by 1.6% in the euro area.
Romania ranks third in the EU on labour cost increase
The largest increases were reported in Latvia (7.9%), Romania (7.7%), Bulgaria (6.8%), Estonia (5.5%) and Lithuania (4.3%).
The only EU countries where the hourly cost of labour fell in the second quarter of this year were Greece (less 2.9%), Cyprus (less 1.2%) and Italy (less 0.4%).
The advance in labour costs in Romania between April and June 2015 is mainly due to the increase in hourly labour costs in industry and services, by 7.9% and 7.6%, respectively.
In the construction sector, Romania had an advance of 5.8% of the hourly labour cost.
Activity report of the TVR leadership, rejected in committees: Stelian Tanase risks resignation
The Culture Commissions of the Parliament on Wednesday rejected the activity report of the Board of Directors of the Romanian Television Society for 2014.
The report was rejected by 17 MPs, one against the rejection (Senator Varujan Vosganian) and one abstained.
The text of the report will be forwarded to the Permanent Offices.
They will decide, probably next week.
The next plenary session will be discussed.
"I believe that given this situation, it will be done relatively quickly," Senate Culture Commission President Georgica Severin said.
He added that "it was a good feeling" that the TVR leadership should be present at this meeting, in the circumstances where no representative of the TVR leadership was present at the meeting of the Culture Commissions.
It was a good idea to be in charge of the TVR because no one here has been subjected to personal attacks or something like that.
The invitation was made to CA members last night, about an hour that we didn’t even know the time, but today, after the meeting of the Offices, I personally sent a fax to the leadership of TVR inviting her.
I believe that at the time you’re called, you’re a budget employee, paid from public taxes, and you’re called to a meeting of the committees even if you don’t like living.
“Because it’s your duty to serve, you’re in an institution under Parliament,” Severin said after the meeting of the Parliament’s Culture Committees.
He added that during the meeting the financial aspects of the institution were discussed on the basis of the negative opinion of the Budget Committees.
The debts we saw as they continued, came up with the idea that this year would be up-to-date, but they didn’t pay off from the historical ones.
"I would like to remind you that it's not my fault or someone else in these commissions has lost that agreement with the banks and with the tax, there are clear management issues," Severin said.
He added that after the activity report will be rejected by the plenary, elections for a new Board of Directors will be held, and he will elect the director-general of the institution.
I don't know who will be proposed for this position.
Miracles won't be done.
It is important to make political decisions in order for this institution to function.
I'm not the man to lie to you, to tell you that a genius will appear who will sit at the tail here and beat you.
I hope that those who decide, Parliament's plenary, by their vote, will reasonably choose the people who will lead the TVR.
There must be people who know what’s going on there, have experience and have a lot of justice and respect for institution and tradition.
I don't know who it will be, if you ask me what qualities it should have - I feel good about the employees because it's a curse of petitions coming from employees, complaints, dismissals.
“When you receive such appeals 50, 60, 70, something is rotten and we talk about the financial situation that is a disaster,” the president of the Senate’s Culture Commission concluded.
Although he did not appear in Parliament, the president-director-general of TVR, Stelian Tanase, sent a letter to the president of the Chamber of Deputies, Valeru Zgonea, in which he requested that Parliament consider a number of measures that could lead to the rescue and guarantee of your economic and political independence of this television and the public broadcasting only.
In the letter, Stelian Tanase requests, in addition to the indexation of the TV fee, the amendment and supplementation of HG 978/2003 on the fee for the public service of television, in order to update the provisions on the day-to-day technological changes, as well as for the regulation of the procedure on the control of the TV fee and the finding of penalties and charges.
He also wants to issue a provision that provides for the extension of the obligation for all electricity suppliers to become mandate holders of the SRTv for the collection of TV fees, by involving ANRE in regulating this activity.
In his opinion, it is necessary to set a maximum ceiling of 5% of the commission on income.
Stelian Tanase calls for a reduction in the VAT rate for activities specific to the public television station and the contribution for CNC from 15% to the level of 3%, but also for the amendment of Law 41/1994, in the sense of the possibility of receiving budgetary/financial allocations for the purchase of licences for major cultural events, the Eurobalt, the Championnament of Culture and Sports.
He argues that SRTv will enter in inability to pay in the coming months, given that labour law obliges the employer to enforce judicial decisions, even if they are not definitive, and salary rights are prioritized over any other obligation.
The TVR administration has consistently made efforts to reduce spending on staff and TV production.
"This has reduced travel and other cost-generating activities, renegotiated a number of trade contracts, and at the end of July the TVR News station was closed," the letter read.
Tanase appreciates that the disastrous financial situation cannot be remedied only by its own efforts.
“Without the support of the state institutions – Government, Parliament, Presidency – Romanian Television will sooner or later be unable to carry out its public mission,” the letter reads.
The chairman of the Chamber of Deputies decided to send the letter to the Committee on Culture.
Vasile Blaga's grandparents, sent to trial
Vasile Blaga’s granddaughter, Ionut Andrei Rudeanu, was sent to trial on Wednesday by the prosecutors of the Prosecutor’s Office near the Bucharest Court of Appeal.
He is accused of tax evasion, in a file damaging about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>600,000, being under judicial control.
Andrei Rudeanu was arrested on May 22.
He founded the security firm Axis Corporate Security SRL, with his mother, in April 2009, a year after he married Vasile Blaga’s daughter, Agathe.
The investigation revealed that, for the purpose of deducting taxes from the payment of taxes to the state budget, representatives of a company specializing in security services would create a criminal circuit, consisting of several commercial companies, by which fictitious transactions would be highlighted.
"In fact, in the company's accounting, fictitious purchases of services would have been recorded, which, in fact, were not provided, the state budget being thus damaged by about 600,000 euros," the Romanian Police said in a press release.
The Seikis have determined Sanmartean's fate.
Al-Ittihad teams have set the fate of midfielder Lucian Sanmartean.
Although the Arab press announces that Sanmartean’s separation from Ittihad is imminent, the press secretary of the interim Ladislau Boloni, Arcadie Zaporojanu, says that this will not happen again.
Bologna is very pleased with Sanmartean.
Lucian plays the title match and does it well.
They also realized that he was the best and that it would be wrong if they gave up on him.
It would have been the option to bring another player, much better, but nothing came out.
"There have been several discussions, such as with Mbark Boussoufa, but nothing has been realised," Zaporojanu told Digi Sport.
Lucian Sanmartean arrived at Al-Ittihad earlier this year.
Ilie Sarbu has been elected vice president of the Court of Auditors
The parliament voted on Wednesday to appoint PSD Senator Ilie Sarbu, the cousin of Prime Minister Victor Ponta, as vice-president of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors.
According to Mediafax, there were 290 votes "for" and 108 votes "against".
The vote was secret, with bulletins.
The PNL representatives were the only ones who voted against this proposal, Digi24 reports.
The Liberals have criticised Sarbu’s appointment to the post and announced that they will contest it at the CCR, given that he has a DNA file, but does not have the necessary preparation and experience.
Ilie Sarbu has 30 days to resign from the Senate, according to the law, because the new position at the Court of Auditors does not allow him to do politics anymore.
The PSD senator will serve as vice-president of the Audit Authority at the Court of Auditors, which remained vacant after Ioan Anton was revoked, following a decision of the Constitutional Court in September 2014, which found that he was appointed unconstitutional.

He revealed that he had been working in the kitchen since he was 15 years old when he was working for a Greek restaurant, so that he could then go to college on the same path.
The actor explained that his mother is of Italian origin, so the whole childhood cooked with his Italian grandmother, reports ContactMusic.
Asked what future plans he had at that time, Bradley Cooper said he was never the kind of man to make plans for five years, "not even two."
"It's not at all motivating for me to have a map," he said.
“I have dreams, things you’d laugh at if I told you,” he said, affirming that what he wanted from childhood has come true.
At the age of 40, however, the actor acknowledged that he saw himself in the near future as a filmmaker, taking the role of Clint Eastwood, who became the director at this age.
Ponta, accused of uncontrolled slander and irrational allegations
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto strongly condemned on Wednesday morning the claims of Roman Prime Minister Victor Ponta that political decision makers in Hungary are "nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which refugees are fleeing."
"Yesterday, Victor Ponta lost self-control and, through his irrational claims, insults the whole of Hungary," the Hungarian Foreign Minister said in a statement.
European civilized politicians do not say such uncontrollable slanders.
“His remarks have one explanation: he has completely lost his support in Romania’s internal politics,” the Hungarian diplomat added.
In a post on Facebook on Tuesday evening, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said he wanted to draw attention and sanction the behavior of other Hungarian government officials, who, in his view, "are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union."
I do not want to respond to the challenges coming from Hungarian government representatives.
"This is a shame for the culture and values of the European Union; both in anti-Semitic attitudes, and with regard to the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now in the refugee crisis!"
The Prime Minister added that he is a proponent of rational and sustainable solutions to the refugee crisis, appreciating that brutalities and aggressive laws will not solve the problem.
Gimpata, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only show that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, there is no better political decision-making than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which these refugees are fleeing!
"I believe in solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions and especially in the superiority of European values - what we see in recent days in Hungary is in total contradiction to these goals and values!" he said.
Earlier on Tuesday, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto called the remarks of Roman Prime Minister Victor Ponta about Hungary's management of the refugee crisis "simple lies", saying these statements are inappropriate for a 21st-century leader.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy also mentioned Tuesday as the Romanian prime minister’s “extremist and lying remarks” about the internal political crisis in Romania and said Budapest expects an apology from the Romanian side.
Szijjarto referred to a statement made Monday by Prime Minister Victor Ponta.
What I’ve always said and said is that I’m against xenophobic speeches the idea of closing the borders, that all those who come here are terrorists, they’re medieval nonsense, and I totally oppose this approach.
If we can get more, we will get, the problem is our logistical ability to treat those people as some people, not as they treat our Hungarian neighbors, with bat and inserio.
"I do not agree with this," the chief executive of the Romans said at a press conference at Targu-Jiu.
On Tuesday, Peter Szijjarto announced that the Budapest government had decided to start ground preparations to expand the fence it is building on the border with Romania, in order to deal with a possible change in the route used by migrants.
Later, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said Hungary's decision to lift a border fence would solve nothing of the refugee problem and "shoot Hungary from Europe".
What is the connection between Osama bin Laden and the collapse of the Meccan mound?
Saudi authorities have announced that the Saudi giant Binladin Group, belonging to Osama bin Laden’s family, is “partially responsible” for the collapse of a moat on Friday on the Great Mosque of Mecca, in an accident that killed 107 people.
According to an investigation commission, the company did not "compliant with security rules", the Saudi news agency (SPA) reported.
The company’s directors were banned from leaving the country until the investigation was completed.
The company will also be excluded from new public contracts.
The construction company is owned by the family of former Al-Qaeda terror network leader Osama bin Laden.
The company was founded by Osama bin Laden’s father 80 years ago and is currently run by the brother of the former terrorist leader, Bakr.
Binladen Group has been working for 4 years on the expansion of the Sea Mosque to accommodate more pilgrims.
The accident occurred on Friday night during a storm when a moat, probably unbalanced by strong winds, collapsed on the eastern side of the roof of the Great Mosque of Mecca.
As a result of the accident, 107 people died and nearly 400 were injured.
How Hagi closed their mouths to the contestants
Considered by many as the greatest Romanian footballer in history, Gica Hagi has been labeled, after his retirement, as a weak coach, who cannot achieve performance in his new position.
After unhappy experiences with the national team, Stara or Galatasaray, Hagi took over the role of coach at the Future Constanta, the team he sponsored.
A year after taking over the team, King demonstrated his ability to transform a team that was battling for the rescue from retrograde into a top.
Thus, after a year, the Future registered, with Hagi coach, 16 victories, 11 relegations and 11 fractures.
The balance is one of the top teams that beat the European cups.
Things took a better turn for the Future this season, as the team reached second place in League 1, with 19 points, one less than the leader Astra Giurgiu.
The future also has the best attack in League 1, with 20 goals (equal to Astra), more than double the Star.
On the other hand, even though it brought to the team more experienced players, Hagi continued the policy of promoting young people, and in the last period in the start team came names such as Ianis Hagi or Hodorogea.
The club’s policy made Futurul a tracking team for overseas teams, so Hagi sold 1.5 million euros this summer – Ianis Hagi (Fiorentina - 1 million euros) and Alexandru Mitrita (Bari - 500 thousand euros).
Along with Star, Future is the only profitable team in League 1, according to data from the Trade Registry.
In the refugee crisis, Romania has played until now as a small country.
It’s a legitimate strategy, but after that you can’t ask to be treated as the seventh EU country.
The big countries come with solutions for the whole EU, says Cristian Ghinea, a member of the college director of the Roman Centre for European Politicians.
In an interview with Ziare.com, Cristian Ghinea showed that Europe cannot be transformed into a fortress, and the purely police means will not work in this crisis: “We may have doubts about the quality of the values with which these people come.”
But there are masses that have started and we cannot go back to history.
Migration is a reality to which we must adapt as best we can and adapt them to us.
In the opinion of Christian Ghinea, we are in an extremely emotional moment, when politicians feel the need to show their muscles.
Once it passes, Europeans will not be willing to give up free movement, but Schengen rules need to be changed: "Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and that was not adapted to the situation now."
Where are we in the refugee crisis after this JAI council that, in fact, hasn’t solved anything?
It is clear that the EC President in agreement with Donald Tusk did not want to force a vote in the Council.
All the prognosis said they would have the necessary votes.
Prior to the Lisbon Treaty, the JAI applied the principle of unanimity and any state could block any decision.
That is why things have been very little integrated in the field of justice and internal affairs.
After Lisbon, the normal procedure, in which the EC has the initiative, is applied, and the Council approves it with a vote of 55% of the 16 states, which account for 65% of the EU population.
The calculations said the votes existed.
But they didn't want to go ahead.
Because it is a sensitive issue, there have been reactions of rejection even in Germany against Chancellor Merkel’s opening policy and they did not want it to appear in many countries as a “EU sends migrants to our heads”.
They did so, but the problem remains because, obviously, this wave creates a huge problem for the Schengen governor and we will probably see major changes there in the coming period.
So the mandatory quotas weren't really eliminated, but the subject was just allowed to rest?
Yes, on the other hand, there is a greater involvement of Frontex in the management of external borders, which means a shift from the individual responsibility of the members who are on the Schengen external border to the responsibility of the Community agencies.
Greece’s border with Turkey is also Germany’s border with Turkey, de facto, and this wave of migrants has given the boundaries of the old Schengen system.
Perhaps you will renounce the Dublin principle, according to which migrants are the responsibility of the state in which you enter for the first time, because it is not sustainable.
If Greece falls, you can't say infinitely that it's Greece's business.
Problem and community.
Just because the problem is common, is it possible to solve without a precise, perhaps even mandatory mechanism of sharing the reception effort?
No one knows exactly how compulsory quotas will work if they reach them.
Because there remains a problem: what do you do with a man who doesn’t want to come to Romania or Portugal, but to Sweden or Germany?
I don’t think European states will take over migrants: you go to country X or country Y.
It will likely reach some unique filtering centres, either in Greece or in Turkey, where asylum applications are processed.
We are working on solutions like this.
But the problem does not have a simple solution.
There are countries that have decades of experience in trying to integrate migrants, there are countries without any experience, like Romania, where the problem of migrants will increase the current xenophobia.
It is true that we are talking about millions of people who are in Turkey, in Lebanon, in Jordan, who are sitting in negotiating camps and who have just begun to leave for Europe.
An estimate says that only 10% have begun to leave, the winter is hard to pass the Mediterranean, but we expect next year to have an even bigger wave.
What are we doing with these people?
My prediction is that we will get used to this problem, we will no longer look at it as catastrophic from a media point of view.
Talk about countries with more or less experience.
Do you think that there is a place where the integration of large groups from a non-European culture has really succeeded?
I look at the Maghreb in France, the Turks in Germany, they are still enclaved.
I wouldn't go to radical statements.
Of course, their integration is more difficult than with other migration waves, but that doesn’t mean they don’t integrate at all.
It remains an unintegrated part that creates major social problems in France, Germany, Great Britain.
But the police just don't work.
Let's create the fortress of Europe and illusion.
The mechanisms of integration in European societies must be put in place.
There were some mistakes here.
We need to be more pretentious.
Let us ask these people to learn the language, to try to take on the values, not to stay with one foot in Europe and one in their country of origin, bringing the rest of their family, including by convenient marriages.
But the imminent problem of these people must be separated from the long-term problem of their integration.
If others have failed in their long-term integration doesn’t mean we have to watch them sink into the Mediterranean.
Maybe we have doubts about the quality of the values these people come with.
And if there's an intervention in Syria, which I don't believe, it doesn't mean that the country will be rebuilt overnight and you can take it back.
Until the solutions emerge, we see strongholds within Europe.
Borders have closed, walls have been erected, border controls have been reintroduced into the Schengen area.
Is the European project in danger?
The European project as such does not, the Schengen area as it was built, yes.
It was built quite minimally and arranging the rules so that the pressure was too high on the countries where these migrants put their feet for the first time.
I mean, we're free of collo, but everyone's with their problems.
In the face of such a wave, it cannot be so, because some countries do not face it.
When there are such waves of emotion, politicians want to show that they are doing something, but in the long run it doesn’t change much.
After the attacks in France, we do not have a much more draconian anti-terrorism legislation in the EU than we had last year.
It is a wave of public emotion that settles in both directions.
And it’s so unstable from week to week that you can’t make decisions based on it.
We have a lot of talk, a lot of wary statements from politicians at home under the pressure of being masculine.
And then, you have the dramatic case of the drowning child in Turkey and public opinion gets excited.
Once the public emotion passes, we will return to the reasons why we created this space, this freedom of movement that is not only for people, but also for goods.
This is the only real European market.
And I do not believe that Europeans will give up this principle of freedom of movement.
There will be other rules and something else.
Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and which was not adapted to the situation now.
How has Romania played so far in this crisis?
Like a small country, who believes that if she pulls the hat on her eyes and claps her ears, the theme disappears.
Faced with the reality of migrant waves, you can choose to be a part of the solution or say that it’s not your little country problem.
That’s what we did, it’s a legitimate strategy, but after that you can’t ask to be treated as the seventh EU country.
You're not, you're not playing at sea level.
Large countries come with solutions for the whole EU, good or bad, we are not discussing their quality now.
Just like Poland did.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the appetite of the Romans for Schengen will be greatly diminished.
President Iohannis says it may be good that we haven't already entered.
So we move from the despair of entering into a more pragmatic position, but the goal remains.
There is, of course, a risk if Romania and Bulgaria enter Schengen as migrants see us as the alternative route.
This does not mean that there is a reason not to enter Schengen, but to be more pragmatic.
Romania will be part of Schengen, and Schengen will exist, but transformed in the sense that the external borders will become common responsibility, there will be single rules of acceptance of migrants, single rules of deportation for those who do not receive asylum, single rules for countries considered safe.
The Ukrainian president said that after Russia shifted its attention to Syria in Ukraine, no one died.
Is there a link between the two shootings, a game of Russia?
Russia has a frustrated attitude of power.
She believes that being a great power means insinuating Americans and Europeans.
From this point of view, yes, there is a connection.
Without the Putin regime’s military and financial efforts, the Assad regime would probably have collapsed a long time ago.
And it was good to collapse before its main opponent was the Islamic State.
For two years there has been a struggle between the Assad regime and the moderate secular and Muslim militias, supported by the Gulf and Western countries.
Then the Islamic State rose and now we don’t know if we want the Assad regime to fall.
Russia has been able to complicate things, but cannot participate in the solution.
It creates a fire of instability and chaos that it cannot shut down.
But you are great power only if you have solutions.
Playing off-side is just a strategy to win time.
Probably Putin is waiting to be offered, to press him on the buttons to solve the situation.
Offers don’t come because the world isn’t convinced that it can solve issues created by him in one way or another.
But I do not agree with the theories that say these people are controlled by an invisible hand.
Let’s not see Putin stronger than he is.
What button will appear soon.
Millions of Facebook users have become accustomed to the “Like” button, and now social network representatives are preparing another opposing, the “Dislike” button.
Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s co-founder and CEO, announced on Tuesday that the button will be available soon, the New York Times said.
Zuckerberg said the "Dislike" button would show a nuance of what a user feels rather than a simple option.
However, the announcement raised the problem that Facebook could become a less friendly place.
Zuckerberg said he wants to avoid the moments when someone posts on his account or an important event in life, and someone else will say "dislike".
Users of the network, which has reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long demanded the opportunity to express their negative emotions or empathy with something sad.
Mark Zuckerberg said it’s not very comfortable for people to “like” current events, such as the refugee crisis, or in the event of the death of a family member.
“You may not feel comfortable giving likes to that post,” the Facebook spokesman said.
The version of a new button on Facebook has not been well received by everyone.
"There is already enough hatred on Facebook and social media," Atiq Haneef of Afghanistan said on the New York Times' Facebook page, where the article on the subject was posted.
"I'll give 'Dislike' to the 'Dislike' button," he said.
Roger Anderson, a microbiologist in Atlanta, argued that there is nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different opinions on Facebook.
Debra Aho Williamson, a social media analyst at eMarketer, said it’s hard to imagine that a single button can convey a complex range of negative emotions.
Further, she argues, the election campaign in America is approaching, and the "Dislike" button would create a total disaster.
Only 70 refugees have entered Hungary in 24 hours.
Hungary on Tuesday accepted only 70 migrants, one in a thousand who came to the table at its southern border with Serbia, government adviser Gyorgy Bakondi said.
Hungary declared a state of emergency during the day in two counties along the border with Serbia because of the flow of refugees, closing a main crossing point of the border and announcing that it will build a fence at its border with Romania.
The measure drew a sudden reaction from Serbia.
Yesterday they said they would seal the border for those who want to cross, but not for those who want to seek asylum.
"As you can see, this is totally different," said Serbian Refugee Minister Aleksandar Vulin.
Before the new immigration law was imposed, a record number of 5,809 migrants entered Hungary on Sunday, police said on Monday.
More than 170,000 migrants from the Middle East and Africa also patrolled Hungary from Serbia in 2015.
Many avoid being registered and try to get to the West, especially in Germany.
The "new" seat of the County Council stands to drink.
Two companies in insolvency
The massive investments made here in recent years, in order to move the institution, are falling because they have been stopped several times.
Two important builders who worked here went into insolvency during the work.
The headquarters of the County Council in Vasile Aleksandri Street will collapse on its own.
Within a year and a half of the building’s consolidation and re-functioning work had to be completed, the work was not even halfway through.
A final stage in the epic of the building was consumed in the past few days, when the National Board of Dispute Resolution (CNSC) rejected a complaint from the company that wanted to take over the contract of completion of the technical project for the work that is still to be executed.
The original project was developed by Impex Romcatel SA.
After the insolvency of the builder and the discontinuation of the works, the negotiation procedures were initiated without the publication of a participation announcement with Impex Romcatel, the firm was to update the technical project, and then a new auction for the works was organized.
“But the negotiations did not end through a contract, CJ appreciated that the proposed form would be disadvantageous to the institution,” said R<0xC4><0x83>zvan Timofciuc, a public relations representative at CJ.
The CJ decision to suspend direct negotiations was attacked in court by Impex Romcatel.
The outgoing court sent the complaint to the CNSC, which rejected it as late.
However, this does not mean that CJ can start searching for another designer.
Impex Romcatel has the possibility to appeal the CNSC’s decision to the Court of Appeal, only after a final judgment of the Court of Appeal, taking into account the finding of another projector.
Thus, the building’s consolidation work could be resumed as early as next year.
Our intention is to resume the work as soon as possible.
In principle, the reconstruction of the technical project should not take long, but we must reach the conclusion of a contract.
"We are waiting to see if the CNSC decision will be attacked or not," Timofciuc said.
Work on the consolidation of the former headquarters of the Police Chess Office began in 2011.
A first contract of works was terminated in April 2012, after 4.5 million lei were carried out.
The auction was renewed, the contract being awarded by Moldoconstruct SA.
However, the firm went into insolvency, and the contract was terminated after payments of 1.5 million lei were made.
The work has been done so far at about 50%.
Initially, the construction, renovation and renovation of the building had been estimated at 7.7 million lei.
"Okay, I say it all!" - a statement that could incriminate the former head of Cadastru
One of the employees involved in the scandalous file from the Register Office signed an agreement to recognize the facts, against postponed imprisonment.
Most likely, his statements will incriminate the other accused, in front of former boss Narciza Nedelcu.
A consultant from the Office of Register and Real Estate Advertising (OCPI) Ia<0xC5><0x9F>i accused of DNA in a corruption file has acknowledged his fact.
The agreement on the recognition of the facts signed by Dumitru Dasc<0xC4><0x83>lu was registered yesterday at the Ia<0xC8><0x99>i Tribunal, the judges determined to give a solution in this case on September 29.
Dumitru Daniel Dasc<0xC4><0x83>lu was accused of being a fake intellectual in continuous form and agreed to execute two years in jail with delay, as well as work for the benefit of the community.
With regard to the facts charged to the SCs and the contracts in the Dasc<0xC4><0x83>lu.The prosecutors stated that the contracts in the SCs and that the contracts in the SCs and the prosecutors had been carried out, which, as the adviser of the Office of the Register, together with other colleagues, "have not been falsely administered.
Last days, the former head of the Office, Narciza Nedelcu, as well as other former or current OCPI employees were sued in this file, the charges being the settlement of services to the mentioned firms, although the works were not carried out.
Pre-trial amounts to more than 300,000 lei.
Adventures in the Stone Age
According to FRH President Alexandru Dedu, Romania can host a major handball competition only in 2024, and preparing the women’s national handball to qualify for the Olympic Games costs a fortune.
The President of the Romanian Handball Federation, Alexandru Dedu, said yesterday, in a press meeting, that it is a great pride that our country has three teams in the Champions League groups.
As for Romania's national women's handball team, "the main goal is to qualify for the Olympic Games in Rio, but for this it must pass two stages of caudine rifles, first the World Championship and second the pre-qualified tournament".
We are looking forward to qualifying for the Olympic Games.
There are some fantastic requirements from the technical staff led by Tomas Ryde.
Staff consisting of seven or eight people.
He wants a second coach, a doctor, two masori, a goalkeeper, a physical trainer, head of the delegation.
They asked us for some things to be qualified, more precisely materials for physical training, which we have never heard of.
All this to get to the Olympics. and I will do everything I can to have them.
We're talking about a massive investment, there's a lot, a lot of money.
But this is the way to perform.
Because at the moment we are in the stone age with preparation.
“The teams we’re battling have these materials and have them for some time,” Dedu said, who said he’s trying to get the amounts needed to purchase these products from MTS and COSR.
The President of FRH also referred to the infrastructure in Romania and the possibility that our country will host a major handball competition.
We have no room in Bucharest.
It is an infrastructure issue and it is a shame to be questioned by a European gymnastics championship.
Let’s not forget that in other parts of the world Olympic quarters have been built entirely within a two-year period.
Before 1992, in the present Olympic area of Barcelona there was a garbage pit, and now it has reached a point of beauty.
The same was true in London, where the 2012 Olympics were a success in terms of investment.
"In my vision, in 2024 we can host a major competition," Dedu said.
He added that international handball organizations are willing to give Romania the organization of a major competition.
For me, it is a priority to bring major handball competitions to Romania.
Mr. Ga<0xC8><0x9B>u went civilized with a project, the people agreed in principle, but very quickly became clear that the hall will never be built.
And I had discussions with EHF, I told them that we want, that we are able to organize and they said that I agree and invite them to the first game in the new room in Bucharest and then we talk concretely.
“So we have all the opening, both at EHF and IHF, but we don’t have infrastructure,” the FRH official explained.
The former great handballer avoided evaluating the chances of the women's teams CSM Bucharest and HCM Baia Mare to reach the Final Four: "I have asked all coaches to be booked in prognosis, that if they do not fulfill they will return against them."
Good way to the World Cup
Romanian rugby players start on September 23, against France
The captain of the national rugby team, Mihai Macovei, said on Tuesday, at a press conference, that all the components of the Romanian lottery are ready for the World Cup games in England, where he hopes to get two victories: "We are ready".
Both me and my colleagues are with the engines at maximum speed.
We trained to give the best return in the four games.
“Everyone will have great expectations, because our goal is to win in two games, against Canada and Italy.
All groups are difficult and ours are the same.
Let’s take it easy, first with France and then we’ll see.
But if we win with Canada, the match with Italy will be our final.
I can’t describe in words the joy of participating in the World Cup, it’s the culmination of so many years of work.
I wish I didn’t disappoint anyone in the rugby family and come home with great results.
“We want you to be proud that some players, a small family like rugby in Romania, are proud to represent the tricolor,” Macovei said.
Romanian national team manager Lynn Howells, who had his first experience as a World Cup coach, hopes to make Romanians proud of the rugby team: “It is a great honour for us to participate in this World Cup.”
I’m sure the players are ready to take part in the tournament.
For me, it's an extraordinary experience.
It is very important for me to make the Romanians proud of the national team every game.
The President of the Romanian Rugby Federation, Haralambie Dumitras, is confident that Romanian players can confirm the progress made in recent years in rugby.
We have a very difficult team and we want to confirm the progress made on the national team.
I wish the athletes success and I am convinced that we will be at the bottom of the event.
"These boys started playing in Romanian teams at the age of 18-19, so there is cohesion, there is a band of friends, who set themselves to realize a dream," Dumitra<0xC5><0x9F> said.
At the World Rugby Cup in England, Romania will evolve into Group D, having scheduled the following matches: with France, on 23 September in London; with Ireland, on 27 September in London; with Canada, on 6 October in Leicester; with Italy, on 11 October in Exeter.
The competition starts Friday, at Twickenham Stadium in London, with the England-Fiji Group A match.

14 million lei given to St. Spiridon Hospital in Iasi for budget rectification
What will be purchased with this important amount of money?
The St. Spiridon Hospital received from the Ministry of Health, following the budget rectification, about 14 million lei.
The money that the medical unit received to use it by the end of the year will be invested in the modernization and maintenance of clinics, as well as in the medical apparatus and equipment for which the hospital has already started the public procurement procedure.
Thus, the health unit will be equipped with a new tomographic computer, with a new radiology apparatus, with six kits used for surgical interventions, six properly equipped ATI beds, ophthalmological microscope and other apparatus necessary for carrying out the medical act.
On the other hand, 5 million lei from the money received from the hospital will be directed to construction and renovation of the "Great Ars".
From the money from the budget rectification, UPU will receive 500,000 lei for the completion of the modernization work in the main trunk.
“In addition, the next few days we will be receptioning work from the gateway linking the UPU to the cardiology, hepatology and gastroenterology clinics to ensure the decent transportation of the patient from the UPU to the neighboring clinics,” he said.
The hospital will soon be in the court and the Dermatology Clinic in Tatarasi, which will be organized in the ambulatory, in the same form as it currently operates.
The clinic will operate in the area where allergology, hematology and endocrinology are located in the ambulatory and will have about 30 beds.
Iasus, made of laughter by RATP controllers and a fold.
The Passion of a Tourist
A family of tourists from Cluj came to Iasi to visit him, but the trip ended with a bitter promise.
After my experience, my wife and I don't want to live in your city any more.
Unwillingly, they were hit by the misinformation in the folds, by the insensitivity of the RAPT controllers and, bonus, by a fine "as the law says".
Husbands arrived in Iasi a few days ago, they stayed in a hotel in the center and asked for tourist folds.
They also received a fold in which the RATP routes were passed.
"Armed" with these maps, husbands visited Ia<0xC5><0x9F>ul.
But two days ago, in Copou, they wanted to get to Palas Mall.
Because it was not a ton of tickets at the station near Copou Park, they relied on the information printed on the flyer: that they could get the ticket via SMS.
No one told them that this service no longer exists.
Confident in the fold, they climbed into a bus and tried to send SMS following the instructions on the fold.
Unfortunately for them, a team of RATP controllers made their appearance.
They said the service had been gone for two years and that it was announced in the press that it had been cancelled.
Where do I know what was written in the local press, I come with the evening before I visit the city?
I talked to the controllers, I explained the situation, they said they don't care, it's not their business.
The attitude was very challenging.
They said that all they can do is give us one fine instead of two (me and my wife).
"I paid, I didn't want to ruin my day of visiting the stand at the gendarmerie and making statements there!", says Ovidiu.
In conclusion, the family was amended because of misinformation on the flyer and the controllers who "applied the law to the blood".
It's not fair, and I did a session at RATP Iasi to get my money back.
It’s not about money, I’m not exaggerated by many, but the idea is that I felt cheated.
Cheating for the rapists in Vaslui.
They had an accident and remained in preventive custody.
The trial of the seven rapists from Vaslui moved yesterday to the Ia<0xC8><0x99>i Court of Appeal.
The outgoing magistrates sued the first term in an unofficial hearing in which the seven young men accused of smuggling an 18-year-old girl were asked to be released.
Before the very beginning of the hearing, one of the outgoing judges to whom the file had been distributed, Viorel Munteanu, made an application for abstention, which was admitted by his colleagues in the court.
The magistrate activated until the summer of this year at the Vaslui Tribunal, where he was the chairman of the Nails Section, being the one who, on April 9, admitted a dispute made by four of the defendants, disposing of their detention at home.
Currently, the file is judged by a full member of the magistrates Maricica Mititelu and Geta Sandu.
Previously, in the file, he also filed an abstention and judge Dan An ton, on the grounds that his daughter is in a concubinage relationship with one of the rapists' lawyers.
The two judges decided that the rapists from Vaslui should remain in preventive detention.
You blacks will be imprisoned for at least another 30 days, when you decide who will re-discuss the possibility of their release.
The next trial will take place at the Ia<0xC8><0x99>i Court of Appeal on 6 October.
Before arriving at the Ia<0xC8><0x99>i Court of Appeal, the duba with which the rapists were transported from Vaslui was involved in an accident in the P<0xC4><0x83>curari district, the car entering Ia<0xC8><0x99>i on the belt.
The Iveco utility car carrying the seven rapists hit a Volks Wagen car that had left the Canta street, and the driver tried to turn left.
Duba flows from the end of P<0xC4><0x81>curari.
The car entered Iasi here because employees of the Penitentiary Administration preferred the route from Vaslui to Iasi to Grajduri, then on the belt road.
They cut the road a few miles.
Immediately after the impact, the escort of the detainees called for another transport, to take over the detainees.
Shortly thereafter, a car was sent to the scene from the Iasi High Security Penitentiary, which took the seven detainees and transported them to the Court of Appeal.
As a result of the accident, none of the detainees were injured.
To transfer them to the other dub, the guards surrounded the rear of the nils, and the arrests came out in speed, two by two.
"The incident was not reported to the police, because the drivers of the cars had a friendly understanding of the damages to be paid," said Chief Commissioner M<0xC4><0x83>d<0xC4><0x83>lin <0xC8><0x99><0xC4><0x83>ranu of the IPJ.
The Great Migrations
Romania is not and will not be prepared for what comes next.
What about Europe?
I say this from the outset, clearly and clearly: the 7000 refugees that Romania should and should naturalize are, in itself, a small but huge number compared to the Romanian state's ability to manage such a project.
For Romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by Bucharest, in the amount of about 1500 souls, far exceeds our good intentions of solidarity with the European Union expressed in recent months.
Certainly, if those migrants really want to accept to settle in our localities, the chances of quickly integrating them into Romanian society are extraordinarily small.
They will be the first to lose their patience.
Parasitized by interlopes and paralyzed by a venomous political class, the Romanian state proves to be impotent in all areas.
The inability to integrate the gypsies is just a banal example.
In addition, governments of all colors have not been able to absorb European funds, make modern roads, kindergartens or schools, provide decent medical care, accumulate dirt on the streets, create paid jobs or create their own.
Why would refugees settle in another country from which they are fleeing?
But what produces a lot of wonder is especially the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is treated.
We are first of all hit by the belligerentness of the EU's powerful states, which show maximum generosity when it comes to sharing problems with smaller countries.
Then comes the fearful hypocrisy of the Romanians who, although they have millions of relatives scattered all over the world, still do not accept the other - from another language, from another religion, from another blood.
Probably afraid of stealing someone’s national being.
Finally, there is a hypocrisy of many migrants who, although only invoke the horrors of war as a reason for leaving, do not accept an exodus destination other than Germany or the Nordic countries.
But not all refugees are Syrians, and there is no war in Pakistan.
Also, the simplistic way in which the crisis is analyzed can only be misled.
Causes must be eliminated, some support and, by strictly relying on the book of political fairness, demand peace and investment for the countries of origin of migrants.
But in Romania there is peace and even more, from time to time, some foreign capital enters the national economy - but this does not prevent tens of thousands of Romanians from leaving their country every year.
Why are you leaving?
In this crisis, the European Union has revealed itself to us as an anchored, divided and overcomed construction.
I complained that Romania is not able to invent a country project, but the EU does not have a plan for the future either.
And improvisations and threats don’t help at all.
Then, to what benefit does the EU, if the only advantage that the Romanians enjoyed - the right to free movement - could be put into question because of the waves of refugees crossing borders like cheese?
At some point, the war in Syria will end.
But not the migrant crisis.
Over the next decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, resource depletion, etc. will push millions of desperate migrants, from Asia and especially from Africa, to a better life.
With such politicians, Romania is not and will never be prepared for what follows.
<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7,000 per year to rent Club Pogor.
Destination, practically imposed
The auction for concessions covers a period of 10 years.
After 7 years in which he remained closed, the club in the court of the Romanian Literature Museum is offered by the County Council for concessions for a duration of 10 years.
The construction has a useful surface area of 134 sqm, on two levels of roughness.
CJ accepts as the destinations given to the building only those of literary cafes, libraries or other culturally profiled activities.
The building was valued at 68,300 euros, the starting value of the auction being 6,830 euros per year, with a bid of 25 euros.
The dealer will have to continuously and continuously operate the building and fully cover the costs of rehabilitation of the property, in accordance with the technical project to be completed.
"The Club Pogor building is in advanced condition of degradation due to the fact that during the period in which the public power unit functioned in these spaces and after its evacuation no current repair and maintenance work has been carried out as necessary during the operation of a documentary procedure,"
The club’s concession offers are expected until September 18.
Two siblings in Tome<0xC8><0x99>ti swallowed somnifères.
They were taken to the hospital.
Two 9-year-olds, respectively 11-year-olds from Tome<0xC8><0x99>ti, brothers, swallowed several Diazepam pills.
They found the pills in the house and took them out of curiosity.
Their mother was undergoing treatment, and the medications were not hidden.
The children were taken urgently to the hospital "Santa Maria" in Iasi.
They are in stable condition, as doctors say.
EXCLUSIVE: A meeting that breaks your heart.
At the age of 20, he received a brave gift: biological parents
Lost in the hospital in obscure conditions, in the dark of the 1990s, when she had only two months of life, small, sick and helpless, and then adopted by a family born in Italy, in the same years in which the adoption was vaguely regulated, a young woman from her age and age.
Crina will be celebrating her 20th birthday, and her adoptive parents in Palermo have decided to give their beloved daughter an amazing and courageous gift: a visit to Romania, to Iasi, to know her unclear past.
The “Day of Iasi”, who attended the family’s search efforts for some extremely vague clues, witnessed these meetings that practically break your heart.
Reporting of reporters, the emotions of moments, the statements of those involved, their reactions are moving and overwhelming right.
The story of Crina begins 20 years ago in the village of Ruginosa, when she was only two months old.
Then, because of a health problem, the girl had to be hospitalized, in the city.
At home, there began to be misunderstandings between parents, and my mother was forced to leave the home.
He decided to keep the girl, and send me away from home.
She stopped the girl, and I hadn't known anything since.
“When I found out she was in the hospital, it was too late,” recalls Alina, the biological mother of the girl.
Crina was hospitalized with her grandmother at the municipal hospital in Pa<0xC5><0x9F>cani, and even then her daughter’s father, Costica Balkan, went to work in the city of Alexandria, Teleorman County.
Their lives had to be permanently divided.
They haven't found Crina in the hospital yet.
After entering, Crina’s father went to work in another village, and returned after six months.
Meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the hospital in Iasi, and her father, when she returned, did not find her.
I think it's been almost nine months since the girl was in the hospital.
“You’d think she was abandoned,” says a niece of the family.
Because of financial problems, Grandma could not come with Crina to Iasi, and the girl remained in the care of the doctors.
Because no one was interested in the fate of the child during all this time, it was taken over by the Directorate-General for Social Assistance and Child Protection of Iasi, who then gave it to the care of the Placement Center in Bucium.
There were years when abandonment and adoption were more regulated than today in Romania.
At the Bucium Center, she was found by the Italian Salvadore and his wife, a couple from Palermo who wanted to have their child but failed.
They fell in love instead of the blonde Crina, and after a while she was going to definitely move with them to Italy.
The little girl had already been around for almost two years, as long as the adoption formalities lasted.
When I saw Crina, I felt like she was our girl.
“It’s like my wife gave him life,” says Salvadore, the adoptive father, smiling, as he grabs the girl’s fairy hand in his palm.
In the country, Crina’s parents, Alina and Costica, continued separate searches, each where they could.
The father asked the authorities in Ruginosa, but received no answer where his child might be.
The police then told her that it was possible to die, but at Iasi parents found out what really happened to their daughter.
When I searched for her here, they told me at the Tribunal that she was going to Italy, to Palermo.
And the conditions to look for her have never been.
We prayed to God to be good.
I've been thinking about it all these years, but there was no way we could walk, find it.
"It's hard," she tells us with tears in the eyes of Crina's biological mother.
But even though the years passed, the parents of Ruginosa were not forgotten.
In Italy, Salvadore and his wife explained to the girl where she came from and that her past binds her to Romania.
I was a little girl when I found out.
I think I was five or six years old.
I reacted as a child, I was curious.
“I wanted to get to know my parents in Romania,” Crina says happily.
And her dream was going to come true.
In March of this year, Chief Commissioner Romicca Ichim, director of the Regional Center for Prevention, Evaluation and Antidrug Advisory Ia<0xC8><0x99>i, was contacted by a knowledge from Italy, which explained Salvadore’s desire to find the biological family of Crimea.
And the search started with just one name.
After the request we had from our partners in Italy, we started the first measures.
We only get a name, the Costa Rican Balkans, and then the town, Ruginosa.
Soon I had a job with the town hall out there, and I could ask if there was a name given through the town.
Then they gave me a few indications, only that the person found was not the one they were looking for.
“It lasted about a month until we found the girl’s biological father,” says Chief Commissioner Romanica Ichim.
Overall, it took more than three months for the authorities to find Costica and Alina, especially since they each had their home in another town.
We started the demersals somewhere in March, and in June-July we completed the identification of biological parents and discussions.
"Then we decided that in September there would be a first meeting," Romani<0xC4><0x87>a Ichim added.
Last weekend, Alina and Costica first saw their missing girl in the halls of Iasi hospital 20 years ago.
The father, excited, could barely control his tears, and his hands trembled unceasingly.
He barely exchanged a few words with the people around him.
A week before the meeting, she couldn't even sleep much anymore.
He was still excited, trembling.
“To see your child after all these years, it’s something,” says a granddaughter, who also comes with Costica from Ruginosa.
Crina's meeting with her biological mother and brother
In conversations with his daughter, who is about to study at a well-listed university in Italy, Costic<0xC4><0x83> Balkan told him, among other things, that if he ever wants to return to him, to the village, to come quietly: he can give him something sheep, goats, to find a boy in the village, and to drown in it.
Her mother is also excited, crying, and hard to believe that something like this can happen to her.
I'm very excited.
I didn't think something like that could happen.
I've seen cases like this on TV, I've been thinking all these years, I hoped, but I didn't think I could be like that.
They're very big emotions.
If he could forgive me.
I hope to visit in the future.
"I hope we can keep a bond," says Alina, Crina's mother, with great tears on her cheeks, while holding a sergeant in her hand.
In him she hides her tears of happiness, because soon she will see her face after so much bitter time.
On the other hand, Crina, who will be performing in just a few days, this month, 20 years, tries to calm herself like an emotional child.
She doesn’t know what to expect, but she outlined a vague idea about her biological parents.
She thinks they are young, but now before the date she tries to gather her thoughts, because she has a lot to say, but nothing to blame.
My parents are two moms and two dads.
But after all, my parents are the ones who raised me.
It will be a beautiful meeting, a wonderful experience.
“I hope I have a beautiful memory with them, because now there are so many things to say,” Crina confesses.
First Family Meeting in Iasi
In the Unity Square, under the skies of the beginning of autumn, the family in Ruginosa reunites their destiny with their daughter in Palermo.
Crina is 20 years old, finishing high school, according to the Italian school model, but she can start a new chapter with Alina and Costica, her biological parents.
It no longer separates borders or countries, but only one barrier: that of language.
Over which, with the help of a translator, an Italian local owner in the center of Ia<0xC8><0x99>ului, passed easily.
Those who have managed to make this meeting possible say that it is the first event of this kind done, and that in the future, if the opportunity arises, they will do so again.
It’s the first event of this kind organized, with such an emotional load, and I’m glad to be a successful one.
We at the Center have different activities, and most often we are associated as an institution that deals only with consumers, drug addicts.
But we're trying to bring back some good things to society.
“If I’m still being asked for such an event, I’ll do it with great pleasure,” says Ikim, the director of the Regional Center for Prevention, Evaluation and Antidrug Advisory.
Behind him, the Balkan family, with Crina in the middle, moves away by telling stories.
They have a lot to say to each other.
Armistice with guns, yesterday, at the PSD.
Everybody's pulling their soul
The camps at PSD's outgoing branch concluded a ceasefire with a gun at its feet.
After successive rounds of talks, held from Friday to Sunday, the first and most tense, the PSD leaders have agreed to temporarily suspend hostilities.
Pressed by the party’s executive president, Liviu Dragnea, to present a united position, the outgoing social democrats will send him a full list of potential candidates for the party’s office.
Far from ending, the party’s internal war seems to have only taken a break to allow fighters to shoot their souls.
Dragnea did not give an ultimatum.
He has released a very simple and very current message under the current conditions: try to find a solution not to jeopardize the game.
On October 3rd we have elections.
All functions will be made available to those who wish to.
"Until then, we remain in the existing structure," said interim mayor Mihai Chirica.
The two days of talks over the weekend led to the conclusion that nothing certain has been established.
In the October elections, a fierce competition is expected for the position of president of the PSD County Branch.
On the short list of possible candidates for the main office in the outgoing branch of the party are the Secretary of State Maricel Popa, Senator Florin Constantinescu, Senator Sorin Lazzar, County Councillor Vasile Câtea and Interim President of the County Council, Victor Lupuel.
The mayor of the municipality of Schitu Duca, Mihai Mihalache, could also be added to them.
One option considered is the nomination of the PSD County Councillor's leader, Cristian Stanciu, if Lupu will no longer register in the race, sources within the party claiming that he is not interested in the function.
The only name that has not been mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations in recent days is the former head of the branch, Mayor Gheorghe Nichita.
The list of candidates is open.
According to the statute, even on election day, nominations can be submitted, and no one would be surprised if that happened.
“The important thing is that we remain united, and we will remain together after October 3, when we will have a new Executive Bureau, a new Permanent Bureau and all new leadership structures,” Câtea said.
Until the internal elections are organized, the management of the PSD County Branch will be ensured by Victorel Lupu, a close friend of Nichita and Stanciu.
Lupu, however, is on leave until September 29, with the preparation of the elections being virtually secured by the branch’s executive secretary, the county councillor Mihail Popescu, who is in cold relations with the Nichita camp.
Contacted by phone, Cristian Stanciu appreciated the discussions of the last few days as leading to "partial consensus".
There is a wide availability to maintain balance and unity in the game.
A partial consensus has been reached, in the sense of supporting a unitary team to deal with the county.
"But on the other hand, there are several variants regarding the intentions regarding the candidacy for the PSD Iasi presidency, the list remains open," Stanciu said.
An outgoing judge rejected the case of rapists in Vaslui on grounds of concubinage
The seven young people in Vaslui county convicted of rape arrive today at the Ia<0xC8><0x99>i Court of Appeal.
The Vasluians sentenced to five to eight months and eight to four months will today present their arguments on their release after the court, the Vaslui Court, has determined their imprisonment immediately after the sentence has been pronounced.
The case was filed at the Court of Appeal at the end of last week, with Judge Dan Anton filing an application for abstention, admitted by his colleagues.
Anton invoked the fact that one of the defendants' lawyers, the lawyer Bogdan Luca, is his daughter's concubine, lawyer Dana Anton.
Luca defends Silviu Ovidiu Burada, who received the greatest punishment in this case.
How the Judges Motivated the Sentence
At the end of last week, the magistrate at Vaslui Judiciary who condemned the seven young people motivated the sentence.
In the reasoning, the judge speaks of the challenging reaction of the defendants, but also of those who supported them, stating that such attitudes create a strong sense of outrage among the public.
"The court finds that after the time of placement under the preventive measure of judicial control, restrictive measure of freedom but not deprivation of freedom, under the impact of the attitude of the serious defendants, their families and their local supporters, it has been felt at the level of the local and national lawsuits, that the lawsuits are more severely felt by the indigenous lawsuit."
Magistrates also dismantled the main defense of the seven defendants who during the trial invoked the fact that the girl they raped would not be a "church door".
"The court underlines that the moral quality of the injured person is irrelevant, an aspect that the defendants wanted to highlight through the defenses they formulated, since a person's physical and sexual freedom cannot be violated under any pretext," the statement said.
Corbyn, Brexit and the Future of Europe
For economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity they have enjoyed over the past decades cannot continue in the years to come.
By Saturday, probably few people in Romania knew who Jeremy Corbyn was.
Even today, after he became the new leader of the Labour Party in the UK, many are wondering to what extent the choice of a politician who, after all, is not in a position of decision can affect us.
Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical leftist Labour leader since the war.
Marxist declared, anti-monarchist nuclear (he asked at one point Tony Blair, then prime minister, to remove the royal family from Buckingham Palace), a ferocious anti-American and a sympathizer of Vladimir Putin (he was also regularly invited to comment on the political events of the toys and the toys of the TV channel).
For Corbyn, who at the time considered the murder of Osama bin Laden as a real tragedy, ISIS is almost preferred to the United States.
Following the model of all populist demagogues, Corbyn has, of course, miraculous anti-austerity solutions.
Things like what he was saying and promising Tsipras in Greece until the time when he was breastfed with the real world and economic legitimacy.
The new Labour leader’s economic program provides, among other things, for massive renationalizations and printing money as a solution for financing development projects and covering very generous social benefits.
Sure, some might wonder why the solution to printing money is not unanimously adopted around the globe, we would then have global prosperity!, but who else to prevent such details.
Sure, we can charge bankers with blood, you become some kind of left-wing enemy, but as has been seen so many times in the past, not only in the former communist states or in Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, at the beginning of the mandates of Mitterand and Hollande.
Supplementary sums are quickly swallowed by generous, uncovered promises made by populist demagogues.
As Margaret Thatcher put it, “the problem of socialism is that at some point the money of others ends.”
Few give Jeremy Corbyn a real chance to ever become Prime Minister.
In the early 1980s, another left-wing radical leader, Michael Foot, who was not as extreme in belief as the party’s fresh leader, unfortunately failed in the election.
And then there was still in Britain a working class, in the classical sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured.
And the unions were more influential than they are now.
Under the conditions of the new industrial landscape, in which services are dominant across the workforce, and extensive automation have caused the industry to need a massively high-skilled workforce, Corbyn’s rhetoric has a limited appeal.
But even from the opposition, it can influence important developments that can directly affect us.
In his latest issue, the Financial Times believes that Corbyn’s choice increases the chances of Brexit, i.e. Britain’s exit from the EU.
The new Labour leader was a consistent opponent of the country’s membership of the Union.
In the eyes of the radical left, Brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalization that has imposed the austerity of the poor.
When you combine this kind of ideas with those expressed by the radical right, with anti-immigration rhetoric and look at the refugee crisis that shatters the EU’s foundations, you come to an explosive mix.
And not just for the UK.
But if the British decide after the referendum, which should take place by 2017, to leave the Union the symbolic loss of capital for the whole European project and the deep failures created within it of the Euro crisis and now that of the refugees, between the North and South in the Maya, between the East and the Vegris.
Even more so than for a whole series of member states, London was a counterbalance to the Franco-German axis (in which anyway Berlin becomes increasingly the dominant actor).
It is true, the British business environment, City, are strong advocates for the country’s stay in the EU.
But today’s Europe is no longer the one of the past.
There are many resentments, which are increasing in intensity even in these weeks.
The problem is that Brussels, we have had a sample in Jean Clude Junker’s speech recently, is increasingly inclined to make major decisions over the heads of the vast majority of Member States by consulting with only a few European powers, mainly with Germany.
And this happens when electoral support for anti-system, anti-immigration formations, which are at the same time Eurosceptic, is growing dramatically across the continent.
In other words, the negatively charged emotional climate has reached higher rates than ever before.
Where and what the Financial Times draws from when it assesses the chances of Brexit.
The pro-EU option is based on a cold calculation based on the national interest.
If voters make a brain decision, then the UK will remain in the EU.
But Corbyn’s victory reminds us of the power of emotion in today’s politics.
However, Eastern Europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
Especially if, as is expected, we are witnessing a more pronounced integration of the euro area, which will push most of the countries in the region and to the periphery of interest and that of the decision-making process in Europe.
Corbyn, Tsipras and Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States feeds his populist rhetoric from the frustrations accumulated in Western societies.
For economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity enjoyed over the past decades, the generous social benefits, can no longer continue in the years to come.
Under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, the Euro-zone - immigration, both caused by decisive decisions that have only taken into account integrationist political ambitions, not the ability and availability of the peoples and governments of Europe to respond to such challenges, the turbulence of the continent and the intense tensions of the EU will affect the major Roms and the growing tensions in the EU.
And it's hard to exclude anything from the point of view of possible scenarios.
The question is whether our top political leaders are able to cope with such complicated situations.
Constantin Brâncu<0xC8><0x99>i, the peasant god.
Rockefeller: "How can I help you?"
Br<0xC4><0x83>n<0xC4><0x83>cu<0xC8><0x9B>i: "She and Aunt Workshop!"
The great sculptor had a great dream: to be someone, to become famous, to hear about him in all the world.
But behind his fame lies something almost forgotten today, when millions of successful stories are delivered to us, recipes for success in life.
That thing also has a name.
It's called "trudy."
What to write about Constantin Brâncu<0xC8><0x99>i?
What else can I say, actually?
His figure appeared on banknotes.
And recently, a well-known bank in Romania hired an actor to play it in an advertising clip.
Brancu<0xC8><0x9B>i produces and delivers money for almost 60 years since he is no longer among us.
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and boulevards that bear its name.
By the way, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
And when he goes out with the adult, he hears the following instructions: "Let us eat in the park, at Brâncu<0xC8><0x99>i."
The country is surrounded by its statues.
There are few Romanian personalities whose works are known to so many people, from children to the elderly.
Brancu<0xC8><0x99>i’s infiltration capacity is huge.
Neither did the communists manage to remove him from Romania’s memory and culture.
Today, his quotes are streaming the internet, receiving hundreds of thousands of likes and shares.
And then again, what else to say, to write about this man?
Looking at a bunch of books and articles that try to reconcile his destiny, Brancu<0xC8><0x99>i’s life seems almost fantastic, totally unlikely.
You know, there are those people who tell you that if you weren't lucky enough to be born in a big city and in a family like that, your chances of success in life are almost zero.
Brancu<0xC8><0x99>i’s life is the perfect example.
And maybe there's a key here.
Maybe this is where the following text should begin.
With a sentence, however detestable they are.
Look at the stupid success stories that are delivered to you every day in newspapers and on TV.
Take a close look at the figure of this man.
Do you want to know how he succeeded in life, how, today, he heard of an entire world map?
It's simple.
He worked his whole life to be someone.
That's what he did.
Constantin Brâncu<0xC8><0x9B>i was born on 19 February 1876 in Hobi<0xC8><0x9B>a, a small village in Pesti<0xC8><0x99>ani municipality, Gorj county, at the foot of the Carpathians.
He is the fifth child of Maria and Radu Nicolae Brâncu<0xC8><0x99>i.
Although he came from a prominent peasant family, Brâncu<0xC8><0x99>i leads a modest life, but one of them had to pick up his tracks that will guide his late artistic vision.
Recalling his childhood and the places where he grew up, the artist had to confess, in a meeting with Peter Tucea, from Paris, in 1933: "At that time life was beautiful and harmonious."
For millennia, people have led, happy, a patriarchal life.
Everything went quietly from one season to another.
And do you know why things have changed?
The civilization of the great city has reached us.
However, Brancu<0xC8><0x99>i’s childhood was far from idyllic.
One of the moments spent in these early years of life is extremely suggestive for the combination of purity and violence that have characterised the future sculptor spent years in his hometown.
The moment is reproduced in the work "Brancu<0xC8><0x99>i. A biography", written by Alexandru Buican.
In 1879, Constantin Brâncu<0xC8><0x99>i was three years old.
In the autumn of that year, when the "in the boiler" was made, watching those tasting the liquid to see if the process is going well, Brancu<0xC8><0x99>i catches a moment of general inattention.
He fills his palms with scissors and drinks unresolved.
He falls asleep almost instantly.
The first people only notice after a few minutes.
The mother panics, then goes into hysteria, believing her son is dead.
In the evening, when his father, Radu, returns from life accompanied by praise, he sees from afar the desperate signs of those who wait for him with their soul in their mouths.
The party immediately turns into a jaw.
My father is already thinking about the grave.
However, someone finds it good to call Baba Brându<0xC5><0x9F>a, a Brându<0xC5><0x9F>i doftoroai and servant of the Brâncu<0xC5><0x9F>i.
The braid checks the baby's breath, then puts it under the horse's nose, gathered in the vicinity.
The baby sniffs strong.
The world applauds.
While the boy is allowed to sleep further his drunkenness, joy, the party with praise continues with even more force.
The next day, the father and son meet through the bedside.
Radu Brâncu<0xC8><0x99>i puts Constantine to collect some nuts and bring them.
The father puts his child down and, with the boy’s nuts, beats him to keep in mind.
And while he feels the burning of hits, the little Brancusi has the revelation that the world can also be seen from another perspective and that things around him can appear reversed.
Especially the position of the sun, different from the well-known, makes him wonder, as if he had to recognize at old age, if not in some way the asterisk himself participated in his disorder.
Could the sun have been as upset as his father by what had happened to him?
Currently, the city is not working.
A MP calls on politicians to remember those who voted for them.
Independent MP Viorel Bl<0xC4><0x83>ju<0xC8><0x9B> called on the PSD and the PNL to stop internal struggles and reorient its agenda towards the electorate.
What we see now on our political scene is a big divide and so on.
I have not seen any of the USL projects since 2012 to continue.
Neither the highway nor the Regional Emergency Hospital, you can see just how politicians dispute their possible locations according to their real estate interests.
Let's leave politics a little aside, let's get together and talk.
Currently, the city is not working.
“If you’re busy with the internal war, you don’t have time for those who chose you,” Bl<0xC4><0x83>juts said.
He appreciated that the current political class has disappointed the outgoing electorate, the consequence being a very low presence in the upcoming local elections, around 30%, representing virtually the loyal electorate of the parties.
The deputy also believes that voters will continue to focus on traditional parties, expressing their reservations to new political initiatives, such as the "For Iasi" party that will be launched today.
Local parties have very little chance and will only break the right electorate, not the PSD.
Such parties are based on active civic people, who are usually on the right.
“The right is framing even more, which is not good for anyone, nor for the PSD,” Bl<0xC4><0x83>juts said.
He said he is not interested in a candidate for the upcoming local elections, denying rumors about his intention to join the race for the City Hall.
I said I don't want to run for any local office.
I am also wondering if you will continue as a Member in the future.
I tried to appeal to the unit for Iasi and in the conversations in the halls with the other MPs, and I was accused of wanting to take my picture.
I don't want to, but we can't go on like that anymore.
"If people voted for us, it doesn't mean they're stupid to vote for us if they don't see anything," Blajuts said, who appreciated that the main reason why the electorate is no longer interested in politics is the hypocrisy of the elect.
A colleague from Tatarasi said that his money was not enough and he had to take the bus.
Let's not be hypocritical.
There's not a lot of money.
Sometimes I'm ashamed to raise money from the cash register.
At the end of my term of office, I will report on everything I have spent, except the salaries of the staff at the office and its maintenance.
It happened to raise in a month and 30,000 lei, with all the transport, accommodation and other discounts.
"To say a parliamentarian that his money is not enough is pure hypocrisy," Blajuts concluded.
