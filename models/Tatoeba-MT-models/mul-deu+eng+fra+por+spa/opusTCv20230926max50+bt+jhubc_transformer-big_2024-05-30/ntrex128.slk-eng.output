Members of the Welsh National Assembly fear they will “look like fools”
Some members of the National Assembly voted for a proposal to change their title to "MWP" (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal was made in connection with plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly from various political parties are concerned that this could lead to slogans.
One of the Labour MPs said that his party was concerned that "a short rhyme with the words twp and pwp".
For readers outside of Wales: in Welsh, "twp" means cocoa and "pwp" means cacao.
A Welsh MP said the party as a whole was "unruly" and proposed alternatives.
The Conservative Party spokesman said that his party is approaching the change of name "liberal", but noted that since the abbreviation MWP, he is not far from the word "muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similar to the letter "u".
The Commission is currently working on a bill to amend the name of the assembly, which said: "The final decision on the eventual appointment of the members of the assembly will of course be the responsibility of the members themselves."
The Wales Report Act of 2017 granted the Welsh National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public discussion on the proposals, which showed that the rename of the Welsh Parliament has broad support.
With regard to the designation of Members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred the name of the "Deputy Members of the Welsh Parliament" (WMP), but received the most support in a public discussion with the MWP.
Members of the House are obviously trying to propose alternative options, but the problem may be to reach an agreement, especially for President Elin Jones, who is going to submit a bill on amendments within a few weeks.
The Reform Acts will also include further amendments relating to the manner in which the Assembly operates, including the rules on the exclusion of Members and the proposal for a committee system.
Members of the Assembly shall have the last word on the matter of their marking when they shall negotiate the laws.
Macedonians go to polls in referendum on changing country name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether their country’s name should be changed to “North Macedonia Republic”.
The popular vote was announced in an effort to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Greece has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour expresses its claim to Greek territory and therefore repeatedly opposes the country's requests for membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, who is opposed to the name-change plebiscite, said he would ignore the vote.
However, the voters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price the country has to pay in order to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Church were disturbed by the problems of the churches in Harlem
“The old people I’ve been talking to say there was a bar and a church at every corner in the past,” Adams says.
“Not one or the other today.”
In his opinion, the loss of bars is understandable.
“People are socializing differently today,” he says.
“The bar is no longer a living room where people from around the world meet regularly.”
As for the churches, it is feared that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as the leaders think, “and sooner or later they will be back in the beginning.”
As he pointed out further, the churches could be printed out by rented houses, with the residential neighborhood filling people who will not support the remaining temples in the area.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will form white,” he says. “The day approaches when these churches are completely closed, because it is unlikely that most of the people who come to these buildings will become their own.”
Both churches built white congregations before Harlem became the metropolis of the Black population. The Metropolitan Community Church was built in 1870, St. Martin's Church a decade later.
The original White Methodist Congregation relocated in the 1930s.
The right to the building was exercised by the Black Congregation, which practiced devotion not far away.
The church of St. Martin took over a black congregation led by reverend John Howard Johnson. It was the central figure of the boycott of retailers on 125th Street (the most important street with shops in Harlem) who refused to hire and support blacks.
The fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners allowed the church to be rebuilt as part of plans to build this bell tower.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's Church, proudly called this bell tower "the bells of the poor".
The specialist, who played on the bell in July, called it differently: "cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
This specialist is Tiffany Ngová of the University of Michigan, who also noted that it was the first bell tower in the world played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who began playing the larger bell tower at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather says no one replaced him at St. Martin's Church.
In the last few months, a complex story of architects and suppliers took place at St. Martin’s Church, some of which were brought to the church by world leaders, others by the episcopal diocese.
The Faroese report, which is made up of world leaders and governed by the Faroese, wrote in July that the diocese was concerned that the diocese would “stop paying the costs” of the Faroese report, despite the fact that the Faroese report did not participate in the hiring of architects and suppliers.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency regarding the conduct of the diocese.
13-year-old boy hunting man in California hurts shark
According to authorities, a 13-year-old boy was attacked and wounded by a shark in California on the opening day of the homicide season.
The attack occurred just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been swimming with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy screaming for help, and then with the group went to the boy to pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was excited to catch the homard, but then “he said that the boy was screaming: ‘Nothing hurt me!
“Something has gone wrong!”
He had a completely broken key bone," said Hammel, who was the first to notice when he got to the boy.
“I’ve asked everyone to come out of the water and say, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was transported by air to the Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The type of shark that attacked is unknown.
Coast Guard Captain Larry Giles said in a briefing that a shark had been observed in the area a few weeks ago, but it was found that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered injuries in the upper part of the body.
Authorities closed access to the beach for 48 hours from Ponto Beach in Carlsbade to the Swami's area in Encinitas.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in this area, but they are mostly not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to invest in the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's wants to create cosmetics streets in the style of business houses, competing with the boots, superdrugs and Debenhams chain. Specialized assistants will be available.
This is a significant investment of <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion in the UK cosmetics market, which is constantly expanding, while sales in the field of fashion and domestic needs are declining. In the context of the investment, the store will test the larger streets with the cosmetics in the area.
Investing in cosmetics comes at a time when supermarkets are looking for a way to fill in the spots that once belonged to televisions, microwaves, and household necessities.
Sainsbury’s representatives announced that they will double their cosmetics range to 3,000 products, for the first time being available for the brands Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The current L'Oréal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees product ranges will have more space, as seats will be reserved for brands similar to those in the Boots stores.
In addition, the supermarket is re-introducing its range of makeup shops to make most of the products available to vegans, which is more and more demanding by young customers.
The fragrance store The Fragrance Shop will also test the concession at two Sainsbury's stores. The first store was opened last week in Croydon in southern London and the second will be opened by the end of the year in Selly Oak in Birmingham.
Online shopping and the trend of buying small amounts of food on a daily basis in local grocery stores means that supermarkets have to do more to attract people.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said that stores will increasingly resemble stores. His chain of supermarkets is trying to compete with discount stores Aldi and Lidl so that it offers more services and other things.
Sainsbury's incorporated the Argos store into hundreds of stores and also integrated several Habitat stores. Both chains bought the company two years ago. According to its representatives, this step increased the sale of food, thanks to which the acquisition was made.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to innovate the cosmetics and medicine department ended up unsuccessful.
After 2000, Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots, but the merger ended the dispute over the distribution of revenue from the pharmacy in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its medical company with 281 stores to Celesio three years ago. The company owns the LloydsPharmacy chain and its sales value was 125 million pounds.
The company said that the Lloyds chain will play an important role as a broader range of premium skin care brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, will be added in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury’s, said: “We’ve changed the look and style of streetwear to make our customers shop in a more pleasant environment.
In addition, we have invested in the special training of colleagues who will be messages and ready to help.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all the requirements. Personalized environments and practical locations mean that we have become an important destination in the field of cosmetics, which is an innovation of traditional shopping."
Peter Jones 'shocked' Holly Willoughby's 11-million-pound contract
The Dragons' Day star Peter Jones "snarled" that TV moderator Holly Willoughby cancelled a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million contract with his lifestyle product brand so she could focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby does not have time to brand their interior accessories and accessories True.
The company of the pair was compared to the Gwyneth Paltrow Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning host announced on Instagram that it was over.
Holly Willoughby starred in the Dragons' Day of Peter Jones, and at the last minute, she moved out of a lucrative joint-venture store with the lifestyle brand to focus on her own new mega contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "snarled" when the golden girl on television during a nervous Tuesday meeting at his commercial empire headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, admitted that new contracts – worth up to 1.5 million pounds – meant that she would no longer have enough time to get to know her friends again.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was expected to double Willoughby's estimated assets of 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving the True brand, Jones flew out of Britain and headed to one of her vacation resorts.
One source said: “The True Project was clearly the number one priority for Holly.
It was supposed to be her long-term future, and it was supposed to be secured for several decades ahead.
Her decision to leave all of the participants was absolutely shocking.
No one understood what was going on Tuesday, and the market was so close.
At the headquarters in Marlowe, the warehouse is full of goods ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of the moderator of the This Morning session, which is one of Britain’s most lucrative stars, can cost the company millions. The reason is huge investments in products from pillows and candles to clothing and clothing accessories on the slippers, but
In addition, it can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby's mother of three children and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Cappova, for ten years.
Willoughby proposed the project True with Cappo in 2016 and Jones (52) became the director in March.
These two couples spend holidays together, and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin’s television production company.
Willoughby will become M&S ambassador and replace Anta McPartlin, who hosts I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We will not speak out on business matters.”
A hard conversation “and then we fell in love with each other”
He was joking about the criticism he was waiting for from the media for his remark, some of whom would consider him an “inconvenient president” and would be charged with saying he was so positive about North Korea’s leader.
Why did President Trump offer so much?
Trump responded with his ridiculous “moderator” voice.
“I didn’t promise anything at all.”
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after an initial joint meeting in June in Singapore, and Trump was celebrating the first meeting as a major step on the way to the elimination of North Korea's nuclear weapons.
However, negotiations on the decommissioning of nuclear weapons have been closed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s chief diplomat, Ri Jong, told the world leader at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea saw no “appropriate response” from the United States to North Korea’s first steps regarding North Korea.
He noted that instead, the U.S. continues to apply sanctions in order to increase pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech before the assembly.
“We’re doing great with North Korea,” he said.
“We are facing a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have this great relationship.”
He said his effort to improve relations with Kim had brought positive results – the end of missile tests, the release of hostages and the return of the remaining U.S. troops home.
He also defended the unusual way he talked about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to talk as a president, but then there wouldn't be 10,000 people out there trying their best to get to the bottom, instead there would be 200 people out there," Trump said, pointing out to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated one of the islands and prepared for the lives of hundreds of people
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations learned that their assistance was not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of Lombok’s residents had to leave their homes, a nationwide disaster has not been declared, which is an essential condition for obtaining international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they do not require international assistance, so it is a bit complicated," Sumbungova said.
Although Save the Children consists of a team that will travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign workers will be able to operate on the ground.
State Disaster Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroh said Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to find out whether international agencies will be given permission to participate in auxiliary work.
Given the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly facing, the country’s preparedness for the anger of nature is sad.
In Aceh, they are built shelters from tsunamis, but they are not common on other coasts.
It is likely that there has been a large number of deaths in life that have resulted in a tangible lack of a tsunami-warning siren in Palu, despite the fact that there was active warning.
Even under favorable conditions, travelling between many Indonesian islands is complicated.
Natural disasters make logistics even more demanding.
The hospital ship, which was located in Lombok to provide care to the victims of the earthquake, is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to get to the site of another disaster.
President Joko Widodo built his election campaign to improve Indonesia’s broken infrastructure, spending the money on roads and railways.
Widodo’s administration, however, suffers from a lack of finances, with next year’s elections awaiting him again.
In addition, Widodo faced pressure for the ongoing religious tension in Indonesia, as Muslim-majority adherents took a more conservative form of faith.
During the fighting between Christian and Muslim gangs in the streets, more than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to leave their homes. Gangs used machetes, bows and arrows and other raw weapons.
Video: Daniel Sturridge from FC Liverpool scored against Chelsea from a distance
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League, scoring in the 89th minute of Saturday's game at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge was defeated by Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 metres from Chelsea's goal, and his team lost 1-0 at the time.
He threw the ball over the shovel and sent a shot to a more distant axe.
His attempt sailed high above the penalty area and headed to the upper right corner of the gate.
The ball finally fell through the forward of Kepu Arrizabalag to the net.
“I just tried to get to that position, get to the ball. Players like Shaq are always trying to play as far as possible, so I tried to make as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching, I made one touch, I didn't think too much about it, and I shot."
Chelsea scored 1-0, followed by Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues scored the goal back to Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87>, turning in the middle of the field and sprinting to the half of Liverpool.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> foresaw a fast-track in the middle of the field.
Then he sent a wonderful cross-country video, which went with Hazard to the penal area.
Hazard predicted the defenders and ended up on a more distant bar when he hit Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker with a left-handed shot.
Liverpool are waiting for a match against Naples in the group stage of the Champions League. The game starts on Wednesday at 15:00 at San Paolo Stadium in Naples.
Chelsea will fight Videoton in the UEFA European League on Thursday from 15:00 in London.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami death toll rose to 832, according to the country's disaster agency on Sunday morning.
According to reports, many people were trapped in buildings that destroyed the earthquake with a force of 7.5 degrees. The earthquake occurred on Friday and caused waves up to 6 meters high, Sutopo Purwo Nugroh, a spokesman for the agency, said at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, has filled the ruins of buildings.
Police Arrested 32-Year-Old Man For Suspecting Murder Of Woman Who Was Buried To Death
A murder investigation began this morning after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
They found a 44-year-old woman at 7:55 p.m. with a point wound in Grayson Mews on John Street, and arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder.
Police are urging people in the area who have seen or heard something to come and say something.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I call on all those who were near John Street in Birkenhead to see or hear anything suspicious to contact us.
I also call on everyone, especially taxi drivers, who have recorded anything with the help of the on-board camera, to contact us because they may have key information for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and was found inside the property.
Today, the magicians came to the scene of the crime of friends who thought they knew the woman and wanted to find out where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and police said they are currently informing the victim’s family members.

Cromwell's statue in front of parliament is the latest memorabilia to deal with the "rewriting of history"
Its removal would suffice for its fanatical Puritan supporters as well as the Taliban to have destroyed so many English cultural and religious artifacts.
Cromwell's company, however, described Crick's proposal as "silent" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current discussion on the removal of soot, it was obvious that Oliver Cromwell’s character in front of the Westminster Palace would become one of the targets.
Cromwell did not command or execute the iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars.
Cromwell may have been wrongly sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent realization of Cromwell by Sir William Ham Thornycroft attests to his perception in the 19th century and is part of a descriptive personality that many believe still deserves respect."
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many – perhaps at the end of the 19th century they were more than they are today – to protect parliament from external forces, in his case of course the protection of the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate description of the facts, historians continue to lead the debate.
The same is true, however, that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is the unique personality that embodies one side of this dispute.
The successes that he has achieved as a Lord Protector also deserve praise and respect."
Pig killer kills Chinese farmer to death <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
According to local media reports, a farmer attacked and killed pigs in a market in southeast China.
A man, named Jüan alone, was found dead with a broken artery and a blood clot near a bread market in Liou-pchan-shua prefecture in the province of Kuei-cho, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig breeder prepares a vaccine on May 30, 2005, in Si-ning Prefecture in Chiang Mai Province, China.
On Wednesday, he travelled with his cousins from the neighboring province of Jün-nan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, a cousin found him dead and found out that the door of the next bread was open.
He said there was a large male pig with a bloody butterfly in the mud.
According to the report, the court investigation confirmed that the 250-kilogram-pound barrel killed a farmer.
“The brother had bloody and fractured legs,” said a cousin named Wu, quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
According to security cameras, Jüan came to the market on Thursday morning at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The beast that the man killed did not harm Jüan or his cousin.
The market manager for Evening News said the pig had been separated so as not to attack anyone else while the police were gathering evidence on the spot.
Jüan’s family and market representatives are reportedly discussing compensation for his death.
Although pig attacks on humans are rare, they have been recorded in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their Massachusetts farm, causing critical injuries to her husband.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing 295 kilograms pushed a Welsh farmer into a tractor until his wife was able to scare off the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon had eaten his pig in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that piglets are usually not aggressive, but the taste of the blood can act as a “runner.”
“They’re just playful.
Shantia, they're curious... they're not going to hurt anyone.
We just need to show them proper respect,” he said.
Hurricane Rosa’s remains will bring heavy rain to the southwest of the United States in many places
Hurricane Rosa is predicted to be weak, moving over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
Rosa, however, will bring rainfall to the north of Mexico and the southwest of the United States in the coming days.
Rosa reached a wind speed of 137 km/h (category 1 hurricane) at 5:00 Eastern American time on Sunday, 620 kilometers southwest of the Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to head north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a corridor has begun to form over the Pacific Ocean, moving east towards the US west coast. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, she begins to push deep tropical humidity from the north to the southwest of the US.
Rosa will bring more than 25 centimeters of rainfall in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Tropical moisture then combined with the nearer corridor will be formed in the coming days in the southwest by extensive and dense rain.
In some places, 2 to 10 centimeters of precipitation will fall, causing severe dangerous flooding, flooding of swamps and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture causes rain, during which the point falls 5 to 8 millimetres of precipitation per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some areas in the southwest, especially over much of Arizona, precipitation is expected from 5 to 10 centimeters.
There can be severe flooding, because the conditions are rapidly deteriorating, which is caused by the dispersed character of tropical rainfall.
Given the threat of tropical rain, it would be extremely unreasonable to go for a walk in the desert.
Dull rain can cause the rivers to sweep in the canyons, with storms locally bringing a sharp wind with dust in the air.
Approaching the corridor in some places on the southern coast of California will cause severe local rainfall.
It can drop more than 13 millimeters of precipitation, which could cause less slippery slopes and slippery slopes of the carriage.
It would be the first rainfall in the area during its rainy season.
On Sunday late in the evening and on Monday early in the morning, the rainy seasons from tropical rain will begin to approach Arizona. On Monday evening and on Tuesday, the rain will be extended.
On Tuesday, heavy rains will extend to the Four Corners states and will last until midday.
In October, there may be significant temperature fluctuations throughout the U.S., as the Arctic cools, while the tropical zone remains relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to sharp changes in temperature at short distances.
A great example of sharp temperature changes is in the U.S. on Sunday.
The difference between temperatures in Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa is almost 11 degrees.
Over the next few days, he will try again to transplant and expand the persistent summer heat.
In the middle and east of the US, a warm beginning is expected in many places in October. In several territories from the Southern Mountains to the northeast, temperatures exceed 26 degrees Celsius.
In New York City it can be 26 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 5.5 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast suggests a high likelihood of over-average temperatures in the east of the United States during the first half of October.
Listening to Brett Kavanaugh watched more than 20 million people.
More than 20 million people watched on six television networks on Thursday an influential statement by the nominee of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault. The attack on Christine Blasey-Ford occurred in the last 80 minutes.
It was only on Friday that radio and television stations stopped broadcasting for a last-minute return: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake secured an agreement on which the FBI could investigate the charges for a week.
Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee said she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh was holding her up in a tense state and trying to get her out at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, who said passionately, said he’s 100 percent sure it didn’t happen.
It is likely that the broadcast was watched by more than 20.4 million spectators, which Nielsen announced on Friday.
The company has averaged CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks that transmitted the transmission, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, numbers were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems with monitoring in offices.
For comparison – a similar number of spectators watch a play-off game of American football or a broadcast of the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, the Fox News Channel, which was strongly promoted by monetary moderators to nominate Kavanaugh, watched an average of 5.69 million viewers throughout the day, the most of all networks.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest was high even after the end of the interview.
The main character of the Friday drama was Flake.
After the office of this moderate Republican issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was captured on Friday morning by CNN and CBS cameras, shouting at him as he tried to get an elevator to the hearing of the Judiciary Committee.
For a few minutes, he stood with his eyes folded and listened to the bells broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m standing right here in front of you,” said one of the women.
“Do you think the country is telling the truth?”
Someone said to him, “You have great power, but many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and before the elevator closed, he added that he would say more at the committee hearing.
All cable networks and other networks took on the matter even a few hours later, when the Court Committee had to vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination would send the whole Senate to vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated charges against the nominee over the next week, which are urgently demanded by minority Democrats.
Flakee was partly convinced by talks with Democratic Senator Chris Coons, who is his friend.
After an interview with Coons and several other senators, Flake decided.
Flake's election had a great deal of power because it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes for Kavanaugh's approval without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing political games" in connection with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times, accused those who criticized her intention to leave the European Union of “playing political games” with Britain’s future and violating national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is attending a Conservative Party meeting in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, next to an interview with her on the headline of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson attacked her plan in the context of Brexit, which is matched to the lady's game. He said that "the proposal is to make Britain and the EU have no absurdity".
Wayde Sims shooting: police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson after LSU player's death
Police arrested a suspect who allegedly shot Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from the LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge police department said.
The police said the Sims lost their eyeglasses during the battle, and the police said the Sims lost their eyeglasses.
Police secured the glasses on the scene and reported that Simpson's DNA was found on them, informing WAFB, a partner of CBS.
After Simpson was interrogated, police reported that he had confessed to shooting Sims.
According to a lawyer, his bail was set at <0x24>350,000.
The Coroner's Office in East Baton Rouge Parish on Friday issued an interim report saying the cause of the death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department thanked the Louisiana State Police Refugee Unit, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University Police and local citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Allev thanked the local authorities in criminal proceedings for “silence and justice enforcement.”
Sims was 20 years old.
Forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where he played basketball for LSU and his father Wayne.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 points per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said he was "shocked" and "shocked" by Sims' death.
"That's what you're always worried about," Wade said.
Volcano blooms in Mexico City
The populace, which is derived from the Popocatepetl volcano, reached the southern quarter of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center on Saturday warned Mexicans to avoid volcanoes, after activity in the crater increased and 183 gas emissions were recorded and accumulated in 24 hours.
The station has recorded a number of noises and noises.
Photos on social media showed thin layers of populace covering glass cars in Mexico City districts, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in volcanic activity, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, after central Mexico hit a 7.1-degree earthquake in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police are in conflict with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after protesters for independence entered into a conflict with the order police. Thousands more participated in parallel demonstrations that reminiscent of the first anniversary of the Catalan expulsion.
A group of masked separatists was stopped by the order police. They lay eggs and powder paint, and so the streets, in which it was sometimes crowded by tourists, were filled with dark clouds of dust.
Later during the day, there were also fights, and the police used boots to get the fighters under control.
For a few hours, a group of independence spectators who sang “we don’t forget, we don’t forgive” were confronted by unionist protesters who shouted “Long live Spain”.
According to local media reports, 14 people were treated with minor injuries suffered during the protests.
A year after the referendum on 1 October, Madrid declared it illegal, the Catalan separatists celebrated it in the region, which is still under great tension.
A large majority of the voters chose independence, but the participation was low, as opponents of the voting crackdown largely boycotted.
Catalan authorities said nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police attempted to prevent the continuation of votes in polling stations across the region in violent clashes.
Independence groups camped outside on Friday night to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but had to go in a different direction.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer believes Catalonia will achieve independence.
“We had one of the best moments last year.
"My parents were crying out of luck that they could vote, but now we're stuck," he says.
Although the Catalan political parties demanding independence in the regional elections last December achieved a close (but important) victory, they are no longer able to continue successfully this year. Many of their best-known leaders have not gone to exile in the aftermath of their own trials and have been waiting for their trials.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who is filming protests in support of police by telephone, says politicians on both sides have contributed to the conflict.
“The situation is increasingly tense,” he said.
Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has been waiting for trial since the end of last year, announced on Saturday that he will run for the European Parliament next year.
“Being a candidate in the European elections is the best way to judge the impact of democratic values and the repression that the Spanish government has shown us,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested for hitting the house by car
A 33-, 34- and 39-year-old man was arrested after a car crashed into his home in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 7:30pm British Summer Time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates were damaged and the building itself was damaged.
In addition, there could be a car shooting from the house.
Meng's goal meant Livingstone's victory over the Rangers 1-0
Dolly Meng secured his first goal for Livingston
Newcomer Livingston shocked the Rangers and led Steven Gerrard to a second loss in 18 games since starting as Ibrox club coach.
Dolly Meng's intervention proved to be decisive, and Gary Holt's team reached the second Hibernian.
Gerrard's team is still without a win this season in the Premiership. Next Sunday, he will be his opponent, the Hearts leader, behind which he is eight points behind.
Earlier this Thursday, the Rangers welcomed Rapid Vienna into the European League.
Livingston extended his series of invincibility in the league to six matches. Chief Coach Holt, who knocked out Kenny Miller last month, still hasn't experienced the loss.
Livingston burns odds against twisted guests
Holt's team was supposed to be in the lead long before the goal. His straightness made the Rangers minor problems.
Scott Robinson slipped through, but his attempt went through the front door. Alan Lithgow's finale then only went side by side when he slipped to reach Craig Halkett's head in front of the door.
The housekeepers calmly let the Rangers play in front of each other because they knew that the guests could cause problems from standard situations.
And that's exactly how the decisive goal fell.
A free kick was played against the Rangers, and Livingstone was able to penetrate, Declan Gallagher and Robinson after the combination found Meng and scored from the middle of the penalty area.
At the time, the Rangers dominated possession of the ball, but were unable to overcome the home defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was out of work most of the time.
This continued until the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to perform the procedure.
Scott Pittman's attempt was stopped by Rangers Rangers Allan McGregor and Lithgow ended another standard situation of Livingston next door.
The centres were constantly targeted by sixteen Livingston and the defendants were constantly distracted, but the players were twice penalized – after Halkett’s move to striker Glenn Middleton and after the alleged hand – by the referee to continue the game.
The “phenomenal” Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
The phenomenal performance and result of Livingston.
All the players as one man were exceptional. On their way up they continue to exceed expectations.
The style of the game and the players in the team have almost never changed since returning to the highest competition, but Holt deserves great recognition for what the team has been saying since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was unbelievable, leading a perfectly organized defense, while Meng didn't give Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall the whole game.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
They played very well several times under Gerrard, but they did not reach this level far.
They missed the final draw – only once they got behind the home defense – and for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table, it’s a raised warning finger.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an has not only received a warm welcome in Cologne.
On Saturday (September 29th), the leaders of Turkey and Germany shared breakfast in Berlin and the mood was excellent.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany. The purpose of the visit is to improve relations between NATO allies.
The dispute arose over human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne over the Rhine to open a huge new mosque there.
The city has the largest number of Turks outside of Turkey.
Police said they had prevented a group of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque for security reasons, but that there were many pedestrians in the vicinity who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan’s opponents (many of them Kurds) were also known to have condemned Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to invite him to the country.
Opposite protests show the difference of opinions about this guest. Some German Turks call him a hero, while others condemn him for autocracy.
Road accident in Deptford: death of a cyclist after a car crash
After a car crash, a cyclist died in London.
The accident occurred around 10:15 British Summer Time near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street. It is a busy road in Deptford in the southeastern part of the city.
The driver stopped and the health workers came to the spot, but the cyclist was injured according to the spot.
The accident occurred just a few months after another cyclist was killed by a driver who left the scene, and it happened on Childers Street, about a mile (1.5 km) from Saturday’s accident.
Metropolitan police said police were trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
There is a closed road on site, bus traffic is diverted and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards were injured in riots
Six detainees were injured during the detention in a high-level male prison, according to a report by the detainees.
The riots erupted on Sunday at about 9:30 British Summer Time in British prison Long Lartin in Worcestershire and are still continuing.
On the spot, members of the Tornado Special Forces were called to get the resistance under control. It is not responsible for the eight prisoners who managed to be separated into one wing.
The on-site supervisors treated minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the prisoner’s report said: “We have set up a specially trained prison unit to resolve the ongoing incident in the British prison of Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
“We do not tolerate violence in prisons and want it to be clear that we will hand over the responsible people to the police and they can act behind the grid for longer.”
In Long Lartin prison, he sentences more than 500 prisoners, including the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison ended up in the hospital after he was attacked by one of the prisoners.
Last October, an anti-inflammatory unit was also called to the prison to put an end to serious protests, and the prisoners then attacked the guards with billiard balls.
For Hurricane Rosa threatens severe flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (may benefit areas affected by drought)
Tropical pressure is an exceptional phenomenon in Arizona, but it is likely to occur at the beginning of next week. The remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa is heading through the desert southwest, bringing with it the risk of severe flooding.
The National Weather Service has issued a warning of flooding on Monday and Tuesday for areas from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to move directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, with her rainfall coming out late on Monday night.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix tweeted that “only ten tropical cyclones within 320 kilometers of Phoenix have been in tropical storm or pressure-lower status since 1950.
Katrina (1967) was hurricane 65 kilometres from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation, with in the Mogollon Rim area of Arizona it can be up to 15 centimeters in some places.
In other areas of the desert southwest, including the center of the Rocky Hills and the Great Pancakes, it is likely to fall 25 to 50 millimeters, exceptionally it can be up to 100 millimeters.
In places where there is no risk of flooding, the rain caused by Rose can be useful because the area dries dry.
Although the floods are of great concern, this rain is likely to be beneficial as the southwest is currently experiencing a dry period.
According to the U.S. Monitor, the drought is slightly more than 40 percent of Arizona currently facing minimal extreme drought, which is the second highest category, according to the weather.com portal.
Hurricane Rosa first lands on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, which still had the power of a hurricane on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 137 kilometers per hour, is located 620 kilometers south of the Mexican outskirts of Punta Eugenia and heading north at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm hit the colder waters of the Pacific Ocean, thus losing its intensity.
Therefore, it is expected that if it reaches the Mexican mainland on Monday morning or in the evening, it will have the power of a tropical storm.
The amount of precipitation in some parts of Mexico can be large, which means a high risk of flooding.
“Between the state of Baja California and northwestern Sonora, a total of 75 to 150 millimetres is expected, in some places it can be up to 250 millimetres,” the weather.com portal said.
Rosa will then continue as a tropical storm across Mexico to the north until early Tuesday morning reaches the Arizona border as a tropical pressure lower, then heading up through Arizona and on Tuesday evening it will arrive in southern Utah.
“The greatest threat to Rosa or her remains is the huge amount of rainfall in the Baja California region, in the northwest of Sonora and in the desert southwest of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These are often expected to lead to life-threatening flooding and flooding of swamps in the desert, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrests for Attempt to Murder
There are boys between the ages of 17 and 18 and a 20-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder of a 16-year-old boy who was found with point wounds in Somerset.
The injured boy was found on Saturday in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4:00 British Summer Time.
He was taken to the hospital and is in a "stabilized" condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were detained overnight in the Radstock area, according to police for the Avon and Somerset area.
Police are calling on anyone who has recorded the incident on their mobile phone to come and testify.
Trump Says Kavanaugh “has endured submission and anger” by Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for the rejection of the reckless and reckless Democratic Party tactics,” Trump said before a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “suffered submission and anger” to the Democratic Party during the entire nomination process.
Kavanaugh said before Congress on Thursday that he harshly and emotionally denied Christine Blasey-Ford's charge of sexually assaulting her several decades ago when she was a teenager.
Ford also said about the indictment for interrogation.
The president said on Saturday that “the American people had the opportunity on that day to see the uniqueness, character and courage” of Kavanaugh.
“The vote for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is the vote for the confirmation of one of the most renowned experts in the field of law today and a lawyer with a perfect history of public service,” he told a crowd of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he talked about the importance of Republican participation in the election in the middle of the term.
“There are five weeks left in the elections, which are one of the most important in our lives.
"I'm not a candidate, but I'm actually a candidate," he said.
That’s why I’m doing my utmost to support exceptional candidates.”
Trump said the aim of the Democrats is to “resist and prevent.”
The first key procedural vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to be on the agenda by Friday, according to CNN.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia claimed hundreds of dead, death toll rises
At least 384 people were killed and many were taken to the beaches when the huge waves caused by heavy earthquakes and tsunami hit Indonesia's island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when at night waves up to six meters high hit the shore. The waves destroyed everything that was in their way, and many people came and died.
The tsunami followed an earthquake with a force of 7.5 degrees.
“Yesterday, when the threat of a tsunami arose, people were still committed to their activities on the beach. They fled immediately and became victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroh, a spokesman for the Indonesian agency for mitigating the consequences, told a briefing in Jakarta.
"She didn't come by herself. She took cars, straws, houses, landed everything on dry ground," Nugroho said. He added that the tsunami was moving at an open sea speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
As he said, some people, in an attempt to escape the tsunami, floated on a tree and survived.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
In the aerial photos published by the agency, many destroyed buildings and shops, hidden and demolished bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water are visible.
On Saturday, in this coastal town, the aftermath of the attacks continued.
Several earthquakes have occurred in the area, which has a population of 2.4 million.
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Use of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by a strong Friday Earthquake was about 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb that was used during World War II in Hiroshima.
The agency said the intensity of the tsunami could have increased the location of the city at the end of a long narrow bay.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, business houses and hotels had collapsed.
As he reported, the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of demolished buildings, adding that 540 were injured and 29 were unconscious.
Nugroho said that life losses and damage could be greater in the Donggala area, which is 300 km along the coast north of Palu, because the area is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication was "completely protected" and "there is no information available from Donggal," Nugroho said.
“There are more than 300,000 people living there,” he said in a statement, adding that his staff and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
“It’s a tragedy now, but it can be even worse,” he said.
The agency faced widespread criticism on Saturday that it had not informed about the tsunami in Palu, but authorities said the waves had arrived at a time when a warning had already been issued.
On an amateur footage shared on social media, a man on the upper floor of a building hears people screaming desperate warnings that he is approaching a tsunami.
Within a few minutes, a water wall collided on the coast, carrying buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the record.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut communication with the city of Palu and its surroundings, which made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The authorities said the army began sending cargo aircraft with assistance from Jakarta and other places, but the evacuees continued to urgently need food and other basic necessities.
The city airport was reopened only for aircraft with assistance and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned a visit to the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia exceeded 800.
The situation is very bad.
Although World Vision workers from Donggala safely arrived in the city of Palu, where employees hid in the sail shelters created in the yard of the office, they were crossing the ruined areas, Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he says.
The situation is very bad.
When humanitarian groups took on a difficult task and began to work on post-disaster reconstruction, some of them complained that foreign humanitarian workers with extensive experience were not allowed to be valued in Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funds, supplies and workers from other countries can begin to arrive only if the site of disaster is declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“But if the government says it’s a national disaster, we can open the door to international aid, but this situation has not yet occurred.”
When the second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami broke out in Palu, the family and friends of the unfaithful had hoped that their closest would be a miracle in the horrific story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, they pulled a little boy out of the canal.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been tied to her mother's body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, trained two unfaithful paragliders at the Asian Games that ended this month in Indonesia.
Some of those who were imprisoned at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, one of whom was Mandagi.
“Since I’ve been engaged in paragliding for a long time, I don’t have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Subandono described how several hours after news of the Roa Roa Hotel crash flew across the paragliding community, he desperately sent messages via WhatsApp to competitors in Palu who attended the beach festival.
However, in his reports, only one grey marker appeared instead of two blue.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he said.
Thieves stole <0x24>26,750 from Newport on the Levee
The robbers stole <0x24>26,750 from Brink's staff on Friday morning, which was supplemented by an ATM in the Newport on the Levee area, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
The driver emptied the ATM in this amusement complex and was about to put in additional money, Detective Dennis McCarthy reported in a report.
While he was busy, another man “flew out of the back of Brink’s employee” and stole a bag of money destined to be deposited.
According to the report, the witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not report the number of perpetrators involved in the incident.
If you have any information about their identity, please contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: repertoire changed its name to Ye
Reper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “The entity is officially known as Kanye West.”
West (41) has been nicknamed Ye for a long time and has used it as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes before his performance in Saturday Night Live, in which he is due to present his new album Yandhi.
In the show, she will replace singer Arian Grande, who canceled her participation for "feeling reasons".
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current artistic name, West has in the past declared that this word has a religious significance to him.
"I think the word 'yes' is the most commonly used word in the Bible and in the Bible means 'you'," West said this year when discussing the title of his album with radio moderator Big Boy.
“So it’s me, it’s you, it’s us.
From the word Kanye, which means ‘one’, only Ye came into being. It reflects what is good, evil, confused, everything in us.
The album is more reflective of what we are.”
He is one of the most famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
The former West's collaborator, JAY-Z, also presents himself with an ally without an ally and in large and small letters.
Mexican President Promising Not to Use Army Against Civilians <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has solemnly promised that he will never use military force against civilians, as the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza promised that he would "never and under no circumstances use the army to defeat the Mexican people".
On this square on 2 October 1968, soldiers shot at peaceful demonstrators, killing up to 300 people, at a time when left-wing student movements began to move across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans with monthly scholarships for students and the opening of other free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education are causing young people to join the criminal gangs.
U.S. Should Double Investment in Artificial Intelligence
As China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in this field, said Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and artificial intelligence promoter who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements come after Artificial Intelligence was expressed by various U.S. government entities, although the U.S. does not have a general formal strategy regarding Artificial Intelligence.
On the contrary, China unveiled its plan last year: by 2030, it wants to be a leader in artificial intelligence innovation.
“Since all the other countries are far beyond the U.S. and we are striving for a further breakthrough in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), a double budget on the IA would be a good start,” Lee said.
“Double funding could double the chances that we will achieve another big success right in the US,” Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" (UI: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order) published this week by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the general manager of the company's investments at Ulo<0xC4><0x8D>í <0x2B> Falo<0xC4><0x8D>ní <0xC5><0xBD>lo<0xC4><0x8D>e, Klo<0xC4><0x8D>od Vence
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an UI system that defeated the highest-rated American player named Othello, and later served as an executive at Microsoft Research and CEO of China’s Google branch.
Lee responded to previous U.S. state-of-the-art technology competitions, such as the Robotic Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when another event would take place, which would help to uncover.
As Lee said, researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get state grants.
“Academic leaders are not made by China, but by large corporations,” Lee added.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired the best brains from universities to work for them on the UI.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help support the U.S. in the field of UI.
“I think that the holder of a PhD in the field of UI should automatically be offered a green card,” he said.
The Chinese State Committee released its new generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to people in academic institutions in a manner similar to the National Science Foundation (NSF) and other governmental organizations distribute money to American scientists, but the quality of academic work is not only in China.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (Joint Artificial Intelligence Center), which aims to engage partners from the industrial and academic community. The White House announced the creation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence (Select Artificial Intelligence Committee).
At the same time this month, DARPA announced an investment of <0x24>2 billion in the AI Next initiative.
As for the NSF, it currently invests more than <0x24>100 million a year in UI research.
On the contrary, in the U.S. legislation, which sought to create the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, no activity has taken place for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country name
Macedonian citizens voted on Sunday in a referendum on changing the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia" This step would resolve a dispute with Greece, which has been going on for a decade, blocking Macedonia's requests for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim on its territory and vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
Both governments drafted an agreement in June that included the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said the referendum will not vote and the boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether participation would reach the minimum 50 percent needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot read: "Are you in favour of membership of the European Union and NATO through recognition of the agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Greek Republic?"
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price that is worth admission of Macedonia, the country that emerged after Yugoslavia's disappearance, to communities such as the EU and NATO.
“I came today to vote for the future for the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79, from Skopje.
While voting is not legally binding, enough MEPs have declared that they will respect the will of the voters and make decisions based on the outcome.
A change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Commission said that no irregularities occurred during the referendum until 13:00.
Participation, however, was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian MEP Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko put their ballots in the Macedonian referendum on the name of the country, thanks to which it could join NATO and the European Union, in the Macedonian city of Strumica on 30 September 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, built a small stage in front of parliament in Skopje and pulled chairs in front of tents built by opponents who wanted to boycott the referendum.
“We’re for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter them with a faced head, not the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We may be a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring the necessary investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
“I am convinced that a large majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after introducing his ballot.
He added that the resulting “yes” would be “a confirmation of our future.”
A poll published by the Macedonian Institute for Political Survey last Monday said 30 to 43 percent of voters are preparing for a referendum – which is below the required participation.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonian TV station Telma, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those surveyed, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, participation must be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would mark the first serious blow to the Western government’s policy since it came to the leadership in May last year.
Manchester City's Sergio Aguero overtakes Brighton's entire defense and shoots goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, broke a light defense and secured a 2-0 win for Manchester City.
Aguer’s stylish goal in the 65th minute looked ridiculously easy at first glance.
The Argentine attacker received a draw in the middle of the field at the start of the action.
He crossed between three Brighton defenders and ran to the open field.
Then Aguero ocitol was surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed around one defender and then surrounded several others on the edge of the Brighton block.
He sent a draw to the left where the ball found Sterling.
The English attacker touched the ball for the first time and sent it back to Aguer, who right-handedly crossed the goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right side of the net.
“Aguera has the same foot problems,” City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about playing for about 55, 60 minutes.
And that's exactly what it was.
We were lucky to have scored at the moment.”
But it was Sterling who gained an initial advantage for the Cityzens at the Premier League meeting.
His goal fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero got to the ball deep in Brighton territory in this game.
He sent a wonderful tribute along his left wing to Leroy Sane.
Sane touched the ball a few times and led Sterling towards a distant party.
The Cityzens hit the ball in the net just before it got stuck in the car.
City is set to play against Hoffenheim in the group stage of the Champions League on Tuesday at 12:55 at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to stifle chances for the Rockies
When the Nationals fell out of the playoffs, there were not many reasons to force themselves to another start.
But the immensely competitive Scherzer hopes to fight against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, though only if they still have the consequences for the Rockies, who have a one-match jump ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western NL Division.
With a 5:2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, the Rockies kept at least a wild card option, but still had to confirm their first division title.
Even if we don't play at all, at least we can still get on the pitch with the idea that with the atmosphere here in Denver and with such a crowd and opponent, it will probably be the highest level we'll get this year.
Of course I want to experience it.”
The Nationals have not yet announced their first substitute on Sunday, but they are all likely to let Scherzer be substituted in such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be the 34th start, would launch a bullpen on Thursday and outperform on Sunday, when he usually has a rest day.
The Washington right-hander has a balance of 18-7 with a score of 2.53 ERA and 300 strike-outs for 220 2/3 changes this season.
Trump at a West Virginia rally
The president indirectly pointed to the situation around his nominee for Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh when he talked about the importance of Republican participation in the midterms.
“In November, everything we have achieved will be at stake.
Five weeks remain until the most important elections in our lives.
It’s a huge, huge opportunity. Even if I’m not a candidate myself, I’m actually a candidate, that’s why I’m going up and down the country and fighting for our great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this terrible, really terrible radical group of Democrats. It’s happening right in front of our eyes.
They are determined to gain power back by any means, floor and fractured.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to overwhelm to gain power and control, that's exactly what they want, power and control, but we don't give them that."
The Democrats, he said, went on a mission with the aim of “refusing and preventing.”
“You could have seen it in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “naied, submissive, evil and lying.”
He mentioned the Senate Judicial Committee (Senate Judicial Committee), name Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which met with a loud outcry from the public.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you let that document escape?
Um, um, what?
No, um, no, yes, wait – her body word was really bad – the worst body word I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party has ceased to be liberal.
They don’t tolerate those who express their opinions.
When the Momentum activists voted in favor of me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the last of the Labour Members to have said that he is no longer welcome – all for expressing his opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received similar treatment because she was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, he criticized the accusation for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
It was about the importance of responsible economic policy, of national security, of Europe, ironically, in fact, of similar issues that Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
In an invitation to the Labour meeting in Nottingham on Friday, it was stated that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
After most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the GC's Friday evening meetings were exactly the same.
Unfortunately, many meetings today are not in this tone, and the promise of a "smaller, more subtle" policy has long been forgotten, if ever paid.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged by whether it is acceptable to the leadership of the party.
It all started shortly after Jeremy got the lead, because colleagues, who I previously thought we were sharing a similar political stance, suddenly expected me to turn 180 degrees and accept opinions with which I would not otherwise agree – but perhaps even agree.
Every time I talk in public – and it’s basically one thing I say – there’s a tyranny of social media criticism, calling for appeals, giving up politics in the middle and listening like I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And this is not just my experience.
Of course, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because my comments tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a chromoby of sexist or racist attacks every day and never hide from it.
One of the biggest disappointments of this political era is how much the level of attacks has normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should support a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer those noble liberals, and with every move to express “untrust” or change the selection rules, the party is becoming more and more narrow.
Over the past two years, a lot of people have been working for me not to get out of the crowd too much, it was quiet and kept on track, and then I'll be "okay."
But I didn’t go into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, provoked by the secrecy of Thatcher’s government, which allowed my high school class to literally collapse, I have been trying to provide better public services for those of you who have already done so, but who have used it the most.
I have never hidden my politics, even in the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East constituency could be confused with my political stances and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who supported the move on Friday, I would only point out that when the country slips towards a Brexit that hurts households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on solving my loyalty to the Labour Party.
But the main link I have is not from the Momentum initiative in Nottingham. It is for the people of my district, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to have been able to serve you and I promise you that I will not be afraid of any threat of revocation, dismissal, or political action.

Ayr 38:17 Melrose: Unconquered Ayr gets to the top
Two recent attempts may have slightly challenged the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved a triumph in this amazing round game of Tennent's Premiership.
Ocitol is now at the top of the table as the only undefeated team out of ten.
Eventually, the victory brought them home a great defense, as well as better use of the chances, and coach Peter Murchie has a full right to joy.
“We have undergone a lot of tests during the matches and we remain unsuccessful, so I have to be happy,” he says.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, “Close down in front of Ayr, they got better chances than us.”
Thanks to Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, which changed Frazier Climo, Ayr was given the lead, but the yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was released by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to re-number and Jason Baggot to re-register.
Climo scored a penalty for Ayr and then, precisely in the middle of the season, scored a solo attempt, thanks to which Ayr could go on a break with a score of 17-5.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, changed by Baggot, reduced the difference by five points.
There followed a prolonged delay for the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who was suspended, and as soon as the game began to continue, Ayr was further led by Stafford McDowall's attempts to change Climo.
The acting captain of Ayr, Blair Macpherson, then received a yellow card and Melrose used it as an unchanged attempt by Bruce Colvin at the end of the meeting under heavy pressure.
However, the home side revived, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for an attack on the Clima without a ball, MacPherson reached a touch-down from a criminal shooting with an approximate Ayr horde behind his back.
Climo changed, similar to almost the beginning of the action, after Kyle Rowe captured David Armstrong's box kick and sent Gregor Henry's wing away at the fifth home attempt.
Still Game star sets off to a new career in gastronomy
The star of the British series Still Game, Ford Kieran, is apparently starting a career in services. According to our information, he was named the director of the company with a license to operate the restaurant.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, which writes and plays in it with his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that the upcoming ninth series would be the last, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning to live outside the Glasgow suburb of Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, but a source for the Scottish Sun indicated that Kiernan wanted to engage in a “overwhelming restaurant business” in Glasgow.
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, cut off from the sea, is hoping to restore access to the Pacific Ocean
Marines surround the naval commando in La Paz in sailboats.
Blank blue flags are placed on public buildings.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are lined with the motto: “The sea is our right.
It is our duty to get it back.”
Throughout Bolivia, the memory of the coasts lost in favor of Chile in the bloody 19th century conflict is still alive – as is the desire to revive the waters of the Pacific.
After five years of negotiations, Bolivia is awaiting the decision of the International Court of Justice on October 1st, which is the highest possible hope in the last decade.
“Bolivia is on the rise, has a spirit of unity and equality and of course believes in a positive result,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country in the hopes that the Hague tribunal will decide in favor of Bolivia, so that after decades of suspended negotiations Chile will be obliged to negotiate the grant of sovereign accession.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who will take part in a controversial re-election fight next year, has something to say about Monday’s decision.
“Our return to the Pacific Ocean is within reach,” he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia – and if so, much would not have changed.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no authority to allocate Chilean territory and said it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice’s ruling comes just six months after hearing the final arguments suggests that the case was “not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And while there is no doubt about the Bolivian arguments, it is possible that in recent years she has taken a step backwards.
“The question of access to the sea was posed by the current Bolivian government,” Zarate said.
Morales’ aggressive rhetoric undermined all the rest of Chile’s resilience, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will one day continue negotiations, but after that it will be very difficult to maintain dialogue.
The countries have not had embassy representation from each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that court rulings would be unusually fast.
On Monday, it will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance "to end 139 years of conflict and achieve mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also rejected the claim that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the naval issue as a political barricade.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific," he added.
“Decision is an opportunity to realize that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea rejects nuclear disarmament until it can trust the US
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his country won’t get rid of nuclear weapons as the first if it can’t trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri appeared at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He called on the United States to keep its promises made during the Singapore summit between rival leaders.
His statement comes at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of resuming diplomatic talks on a nuclear issue with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un just over three months after Singapore.
Ri says it’s an illusion to think that the US’s continued sanctions and protests against a declaration that would end the Korean War could smear the North on its knees.
Washington is reluctant to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang taking significant steps towards disarmament first.
Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is general skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about denying the arsenal, which the country most likely sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month in preparation for the second summit between Kim Jong Un and Trump.
Paris fashion tours showcase the latest trends in impressive head covers, which you will soon find in your shop
If you want to expand your collection of hats or perfectly protect yourself from the sun, you don’t have to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have unveiled in their spring/summer 19 collection on the mole a whole range of unusual oversized head covers that have stunned viewers at the Paris Fashion Week.
Highly impractical hats flooded Instagram this year and these designers sent their shocking creations to the performance mold.
A unique piece from Valentine was a large beige hat decorated with a papyrus roof that covered the models’ heads.
Other oversized supplements included a melon with precious stones, a magic hat, and even pineapple – but they are not designed to warm you up.
Thom Browne also predicted a selection of bizarre masks – exactly in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had embroidered feathers and resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than Haute Couture.
One piece resembled a diving gear, even with snorkel and glasses, while the other looked like a corneal with melted ice.
And if you like bold fashion expressions, you are lucky.
Style experts predict that huge hats will also get into the usual stores in your area.
The oversized hats follow the inspiration of "La Bomba", a slender hat with a roof of 60 centimeters that everyone wore, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowska.
A cult brand standing behind a highly impractical hat that was hanging around every corner of social media, sent another great creation to the mole – a slender beach bag almost as large as a model’s swimsuit that wears it.
The rafi bag in flamenco orange, framed with rafia straps and complemented by white leather earrings, was a unique piece of the La Riviera spring/summer 19 collection from the Jacquemus brand at the Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to come to the regular stores next year with big hats and beach bags – as the designer had such a huge impact, it would be hard to ignore the demand for excess supplements.”
John Edward: Without linguistic skills, a global citizen will not be deprived
Scottish independent schools maintain excellent academic results and this trend continues in 2018 with a further year of extraordinary test results, further strengthening individual and collective successes in sports, arts, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the highest level of service to their pupils and their parents.
Independent schools are trying to prepare students for further and higher education, careers according to their predecessors and place in the world as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement tailor-made schooling, we continue to perceive modern languages as a popular and sought-after subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “When you talk to a man in the language he understands, you speak to his head.
When you speak to him in his own language, you speak to his heart.”
It is a strong reminder that if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries, we cannot rely only on English.
From this year’s test results, we can see that languages are at the top of the table with the highest marking diameter among independent schools.
In total, up to 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages reached the highest A mark.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students reached the highest A mark in Mandarin Chinese, 72 percent in German, 69 percent in French and 63 percent in Spanish.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as the basic skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are today considered as selective subjects in independent and other schools as equally important as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
The UK Employment and Skills Commission survey in 2014 found that among the reasons employers cited as job occupancy problems, 17 per cent were inadequate linguistic skills.
That is why language skills are becoming increasingly necessary in preparing young people for their future careers.
As more and more prospective job opportunities are emerging that require languages, these skills are becoming essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future with such a lifetime ability.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically give a multilingual person an advantage over the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak any foreign language enough to be able to communicate, while French was the only language in which the number of people reached 15 percent.
Therefore, it is important for children today to invest in language learning.
Knowledge of multiple languages, especially the languages of developed economies, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, each school will vary depending on the language it teaches.
Some schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK in terms of the future in 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, in independent schools he will always be able to choose from a multitude of languages and will be taught by experts in the field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing an educational environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills needed to succeed, no matter what the future brings.
It is currently impossible to argue that in the global business environment, languages are still essential for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should in fact be called “international communication abilities.”
Independent schools will continue to offer this opportunity, diversity and excellent quality for young people in Scotland.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron is set to debut in San Diego on Sunday
Fans who are looking forward to LeBron James' first game for the Los Angeles Lakers are already waiting for a moment.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
However, it is not yet clear how many minutes he will play.
“It’s going to be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James expressed his plans for the six-game preparations for the Lakers.
“At this stage of my career, I no longer need to start a pre-match,” he said.
Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump has launched a series of election rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It’s the first of Trump’s planned rallyes next week, including stops in allied locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
After voting for his candidate for the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump plans to build support for the upcoming midterms because Republicans are at risk of losing control when voting in November.
What time is the Trump meeting in West Virginia today and where can you watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is held at 7:00 p.m. Eastern time today, on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia online below, via live stream on YouTube.
It is likely that Trump will comment on the current hearing of Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh, who has been on charges of sexual harassment, with the expected confirmation vote by the Senate, postponed to F.
But the original goal of this series of rallyes is primarily to help Republicans, who are awaiting the tough November elections, regain strength.
According to Reuters, the five rallyes are aimed at "encouraging volunteers and supporters" next week, as Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives.
"Control over Congress is so critical to his agenda that when entering the busy election season, the president travels to as many states as possible," a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters, who refused to be named.
Today’s rally, held at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling City, could attract fans from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract media attention from Pittsburgh,” West Virginia Metro News said.
Trump will visit West Virginia on Saturday for the second time in the last month, a state in which he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to support Republican senate candidate for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, whose research preferences are declining.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to raise his research preferences,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team demonstrates courage to fight and builds hope for success in entering individual Sunday fights
After three one-sided series, foursome games on Saturday can be exactly what this Ryder Cup needs.
The swinging power button is an invented sports concept, but players really believe in it, especially in competitions of this type.
So, what side do they think the hybrid force is now on?
"They scored six points, now it's just four, so we could say we have a mild swing force now," said Jordan Spieth as he was preparing for his competition day.
Of course, Europe has an advantage, a four-point jump and another twelve in play.
As Spieth says, however, Americans feel a mild wind in their sails and have plenty of reasons to hope, among other things thanks to the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them scored three out of four.
Spieth was insurmountable from firing to the last hole and leads others by his example.
As his round progressed, the proud festive screams became louder, drowning the key road and the fourth match was indecisive when he and Thomas had two to two less.
His path, which won the match at 15, celebrated a similar scream that proves his conviction that the American team is not yet lost in the competition.
“You just have to wrap your sleeves and get into it, just think about your own game,” Spieth said.
None of the players are left with anything else.
18 pits where you have to reach the maximum.
The only players who have scored more points in the last two days than Spieth and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, Ryder Cup favourites.
A strange but charming European couple has four out of four and has no way to make a mistake.
"Moliwood" was the only pair that did not shoot the Bogeys on Saturday afternoon, but they avoided it on Saturday morning, on Friday night, and at the other nine holes on Friday morning.
This wheel and the way the energy flows between the crowd and the players confirms that these players will have to be defeated on Sunday, and it is only hard to find a more popular player who would secure a potential European victory in the Gulf of Mowood but not in the sunset.
The best of both at the same time in different holes.
However, things about European fame are still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson had a brief trial with Sergio Garcio, the hero of the early fourballs, while playing in pairs with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes evacuated the Spanish and Swedish caves from which they were no longer able to dig.
There's no one here on Sunday to help you get out of the pit.
Fourball and foursome matches are closely fascinating due to the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and also in how the strategy can change from minute to minute.
Europe has played better so far, and by the end of the day it has a substantial lead, but these four-legged wheels have also shown that the US is not afraid to worry about what some, especially on the American continent, have doubted.
On the Ryder Cup final day, Europe takes the lead 10:6
Europe will enter the final day of the Ryder Cup with a substantial advantage after finishing Saturday’s fourball and foursome with a 10:6 lead over the United States.
Excited duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led an attack with two victories over Tiger Woods to credit four points to their account at Le Golf National so far.
The European side Thomas Bjorn, trying to keep the trophy he lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated the failing American side in the morning fourball matches and won the series 3-1.
In the foursome games, the Americans offered more resistance, they won two games, but were unable to starve their deficit.
Jim Furyk's party needs eight points out of Sunday's 12 individual matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to score four points in a row, while together with Mollinar, under the nickname "Molliwood" they are only the second pair to win four points in their opening four games in Cu R.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball matches, they strengthened their performance brilliantly and defeated the downtrodden Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who played two matches on Saturday, proved occasional flashes of brightness, but ultimately lost 19 of his 29 matches to fourball and foursome and seven consecutive.
Justin Rose, who missed the early fourball matches, returned to accompany Henrik Stenson in the foursome and together defeat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepku – the unit and three in the world lap.
However, Europe did not have it quite simple on that pleasant, fresh day to the southwest of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a two-point lap for the Americans on Saturday.
They earned a costly 2&1 win over Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourball matches and later returned to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in foursome matches after losing their first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team managed to get out of a four-point deficit when entering individual matches, although Furyk's side as a title defender only needs a draw to keep the trophy.
After being in the second place for two days, however, it seems that the Sunday counterattack will probably be over their powers.
North Korea 'under no circumstances' will disarm unilaterally without trust
The U.N. Foreign Minister said on Saturday that the continued sanctions had deepened distrust of the United States and that the country would under no circumstances unilaterally surrender its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual general meeting of the World Institute that North Korea has taken "substantial austerity measures" over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and a commitment not to expand the nuclear test site.
“But we don’t see any response from the United States,” he added.
“Without any trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances it is excluded that we will be the first to unilaterally disarm ourselves.”
While Ri reiterated North Korea’s known complaints against Washington’s opposition to a gradual approach to nuclear disarmament, in which North Korea would be rewarded in taking gradual steps, his view was fundamental in not immediately rejecting the unilateral, unilateral, nuclear-free approach.
Ri referred to a joint opinion issued by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the very first summit between the current U.S. president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work on Trump’s “nuclear defence armor” of the Korean Peninsula.
North Korea tried to achieve a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States declared that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also refused to impose severe international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States first insists on nuclear disarmament and increases tensions through sanctions to achieve its purpose in a coercive manner and even by objecting to the ‘declaration of an end to the war’,” Ri said.
“The idea that the sanctions are killing us on our knees is the illusion of people who don’t know anything about us.
The problem, however, is that the ongoing sanctions overwhelm our distrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim Jong Un and Trump, which the U.S. president told the United Nations earlier this week.
However, the minister stressed three meetings between Kim Jong-un and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the other side of the issue of nuclear disarmament were South Korea instead of the United States, the disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not be such.”
Despite this, the tone of Rih’s speech differed dramatically from last year’s, when he told the UN General Assembly that the targeting of the U.S. with North Korean missiles is irreversible after Trump called “President Evil” Kim a “missile self-return.”
This year Trump, who threatened last year to “totally destroy North Korea,” sang on the grounds of the UN praise to Kim for his courage to take disarmament steps, but said there is still a lot of work ahead of him and sanctions must remain outside until he wakes up.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable for it, saying it “didn’t matter whether it would take two, three years or five months.”
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday that “the implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue strictly and without exception until we reach a complete, final and verified nuclear disarmament.”
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to curb funding of Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and later announced that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit has not been a good one.
In July, he left Pyongyang with the view that progress had been made, but only a few hours later, North Korea condemned him for making “gangster demands.”
North Korea has pledged to dismantle the missile test site and the nuclear complex at a meeting with Moon this month if the United States takes “appropriate measures.”
According to his statement, Kim told him that the "responsive measures" he expected were security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students complete a course on how to breathe enough
The goal of this year’s new course at Harvard University is to achieve that all students have more sleep in an effort to suppress the growing trend of studying overnight with the help of caffeine.
Scientists have found that students at a world-leading university are often unemployed when it comes to the full foundations of their health care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Clinic, has developed a course that he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
When he started the course, he was inspired by a lecture he taught about sleep deprivation and its impact on learning.
“At the end of the day, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why am I learning about this until now, in the last year?’
She claimed that no one ever told her about the meaning of sleep, which surprised me,” she told The Telegraph.
The course, which took place this year for the first time, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help academic and sports performance while improving overall health.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University's health service, said the university decided to open the course when it found that students were suffering from severe sleep deprivation during the working week.
The hourly course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part of the screen is a picture of an internal room, where students can click on cups of coffee, curtains, tennis and books, and learn about the effects of caffeine, light and how sleep deprivation affects sports performance and performance.
In the next section, participants learn how long-term sleep deficiency can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the university campus with interactive icons further encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know that this will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we are convinced that they have the right to know about it – just as everyone has the right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes,” Professor Czeisler added.
There is still a culture in which students are proud to have been able to learn all night, says, and adds that modern technology and increasing pressure on students means that sleep deprivation has become a growing problem.
Ensuring enough good quality sleep should be a “secret weapon” for students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said – even against weight gain, because sleep deficits get the brain into the hunger mode, so they don’t have enough sleep.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Ceisler design the course after attending one of his seminars last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to try to translate the course at the university level.
Hopefully, in the next step, it will be possible to require all graduate students to complete a similar study program before starting a challenging study.
Prof. Czeisler advises students to set an alarm clock for the time they are supposed to go to bed, as well as for the time they are supposed to wake up, and to realize the harmful effects of "blue light," which trigger electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt the problem.
Livingston 1 : 0 Rangers: Meng's goal submerged Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another round of sadness at the outside game when Dolly Meng's shot smashed Steven Gerrard to a 1–0 loss at Livingstone.
The Ibrox guests tried to record their first win out of the February 4–1 victory in St Johnston, but Gary Holt's team brought Gerrard only his second defeat in 18 games as manager and left his team in the position of 8 points from the leaderboards of the Premiersbrokes.
He scored me seven minutes ago, and the Rangers, which lacked inspiration, didn't even get close to the match.
While the Rangers now fell to the sixth lap, Livingston jumped to the third lap and stood behind the Hibernian with only one goal difference.
And the Rangers may have other problems after line referee Calum Spence suffered a head injury because he was hit by an object apparently thrown out of the courtroom for guests.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, and the Rangers then defeated Ayr and reached the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt left the same eleventh to Levy, who had taken Hearts last week, and was thrilled to see how his well-established crew suffocated his opponents in every action.
The Rangers may have dominated holding the ball, but Livingston was more active when he reached the ball.
They were supposed to score only in the second minute of the match when the first Meng call from the pitch sent Scott Pittman towards the goal of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder missed his big chance.
Keaghan Jacobs's long straight tail was then found by Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, was only able to pass the rear bar far away.
The Rangers took control, but in the final third they seemed to have hope rather than conviction in their game.
Alfredo Morelos claimed the right to a penalty after a quarter-hour game when he met Steven Lawles, but referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's request.
The Rangers only scored two shots in the first half, but the former Ibrox goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, barely eliminated head of Lassana Coulibaly and short shots of Ovie Ejari.
Although Livi’s opening goal in the 34th minute could have been inconsistent with the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it just for their effort.
The Rangers failed to cope with Jacobs' corner again.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher moved the ball with a whip to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool head and chose Meng for a simple finish.
Gerrard took a break, exchanged Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, and the exchange had an almost immediate impact when the wing attacker found Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed out of his line and blocked him.
But Livingston continued to force the guests to play exactly the kind of game they liked when Lithgow and Halkett shot one long ball after another.
Holt's side may have drawn his lead in the final stages, but McGregor defended Jacobs well and then resisted Lithgow's wide corner head.
Deputy Rangers, Glenn Middleton, later claimed a penalty when he joined Jacobs, but Thomson reviewed it again.
Chronicle: The Inventor of Geiger's Computer
And now we have a page from our Sunday morning chronicle: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago... that was the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the design of a device known as the Geiger computer.
Geiger's computer, in addition to being an inseparable part of science to this day, also became a staple of pop culture when he was talked about in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" cowboys who attracted science, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What the hell is this?”
Rogers: “This is Geiger’s computer, it’s detecting radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on your headphones, you really hear the sounds of atoms that create radioactivity in minerals.”
Evans: “I mean, I can hear them bursting!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach Immune System to “See” Weight Loss Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach Immune System to “See” Weight Loss Cells and Kill them
Vaccine Teaches Immune System to Recognize Weight Loss Cells in Treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their modification in the laboratory
They then “see” the protein common in many types of cancer and inject it back
The tested vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
In one woman who was treated with a vaccine that taught the immune system to recognize fat cells, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
In this method, the patient is extracted immune cells, adjusted in the laboratory so that they can "see" the protein common in many types of cancer, called HER2, and then the cells are injected back.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Oncology Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our findings suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "supports the growth of several types of cancer" including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to the removal of immune cells from patients and their "learning" how to target cancer cells worked in the treatment of the same type of leukemia.
Kanye West, with a MAGA cap on his head, has become the target of criticism for Trump’s support after a performance on Saturday Night Live.
It didn't go well
Kanye West was written out of the studio during the Saturday Night Live show after a chaotic performance in which he sung U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
When he finished his third song called Ghost Town, during which he had a cap on his head with the inscription Make America Great, he launched an attack on Democrats and emphasized his support for Trump.
“So many times I talked to a white man and he said to me, ‘If you can recognize Trump, he’s a racist, right?’
“Well, if I was suffering from racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago,” he said.
Show Saturday Night Live (SNL) began with a scene with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star made footage of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before a Senate jury on charges of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
While West's speech was not broadcast, comedian Chris Rock posted it on social media.
It is unclear whether Rock was trying to make West laugh with his share.
West also complained to the public that he had experienced difficult moments in the backstage for his hat.
“I was bullied behind the scenes.
They told me, ‘Don’t go there with that hat on your head.’
I was normally bullied!
And then they told me that I was in the day," according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “You want to see how I am on the day? I’m going to put on my superhuman coat, because that means no one is going to tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try it with love.”
His comments deserved a beating from the audience at least twice and the rest of the SNL’s performers were in dismay, Variety magazine said, with one person telling the media: “The whole studio was dominated by grave silence.”
West was invited as a short-lived replacement for singer Arianna Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West surprised many when the song I Love It featured dressed as a Perrier water bottle.
Westa was backed by TPUSA leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: “A link to one of the most courageous souls: LOVE, YOU ARE AGAINST THE DAVID.”
But talk show moderator Karen Hunter said on Twitter that West was “simplely himself and that’s absolutely amazing.”
“But I am determined NOT to change anyone (by buying his music, a clothing brand, or by supporting his ‘art’) who I believe is accepting and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
We are, too," she added.
Before the start of the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and from now on will be "Ye", formally known as Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to change his name, but continues in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, rapper Snoop Dogg, at the same time had the name Snoop Lion, and of course there is a deadly music legend of Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to an artist, formerly known as Prince.
Prosecution for attempted murder in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after the same man was injured in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
Police have confirmed the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrate’s Court on Monday.
The charges will be assessed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington condemned toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as the sword of armed Jonah Snow in the rough medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones from the HBO workshop.
But the 31-year-old actor condemned the stereotype of the male hero and said that for such characters on the screen, young boys often feel that they have to be rude to respect them.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture Kit, he said, “something has gone wrong somewhere and is thinking about how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones colleague and 31-year-old Rose Leslie, admitted that solving the problem is “very important.”
“I personally feel that it is very important to deal with where something went wrong in our masculinity,” he said.
“What do we teach men during adolescence when there is a problem that we see now?”
Kit is convinced that television can be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity for his exaggerated masculine characters.
He continued, “What is born, and what is taught?
What does television teach, and what is happening on the streets, that young boys feel they must have this particular side of masculinity?
I think that’s really one of the big questions of our time – how can we change it?
Because it's clear that there's something out there in young men."
In the interview, he also admitted that when the series ends next year, he will no longer film any prologs or sequels to the Game of Thrones, because "he's already finished with fighters and horses".
Starting in November, Kit will play in a new adaptation of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of the filmmaker and his brother, the thief.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his wife Rose is, in his opinion, the best thing that emerged from the Game of Thrones series.
“Thanks to this show, I met my wife, so in a sense she gave me my future family and my future life,” he said.
In the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series, Rose Ygritte played the love of Kit's character, John Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 on the grounds of the Leslie family headquarters in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China says 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say that more than 820,000 people are infected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, more than 40,000 new cases have been reported.
The vast majority of new cases have been sexually transmitted, which is a change compared to the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has dropped to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still widespread.
As a result of the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who had sex with a man eventually get married to a woman.
Many cases of transmission of the disease result from insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medicines as part of its efforts to address this problem.
Maxine Waters argues that her employee would let go of GOP senators’ data, criticizing “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. MP Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff would send personal data from three U.S. Republican senators to the Wikipedia legislator.
The Los Angeles Democrat says the charges come from “ultra-traffic” experts and websites.
"Lies, lies and other disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information reportedly contained home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, being published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a hearing of the Senate jury on charges of sexual harassment against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The information evaded the same time as the length of the Kavanaugh senators listened.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that IP addresses identifying the source of the leaks were linked to the Waters office and provided information about a Waters staff member, Hill said.
“This unconfirmed charge is completely false and absolutely false,” Waters continued.
“A member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of such fraudulent and false accusations, was under no circumstances responsible for the leakage of this information.
“This unconfirmed accusation is completely false and absolutely false.”
Waters’ statement quickly attracted criticism online, among others from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"She supports it is full of anger," Fleischer wrote.
“This indicates that she doesn’t have the right temperament to be a congresswoman.
When someone is accused of something they haven’t done, they shouldn’t be angry.
They must not be contradictory.
He must not question the plaintiff’s motives.
It must be peaceful and balanced.”
Fleischer was likely comparing Waters’ reaction to criticizing Judge Kavanaugh by Democrats, who were accused of being too angry during Thursday’s hearings.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who runs for Waters in the standings, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“If that’s true, it’s big,” he wrote.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had notified the competent authorities and authorities acting in criminal proceedings of fraudulent allegations.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators of the disclosure are, and they will be legally responsible for their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all members of my staff.”
Johnny English's review of the film is back - a sub-dimensioned spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
Nowadays, it is common to look for references to Brexit in every new film with a British perspective, and this also applies to this reincarnation of the action comedy parody with Johnny English – which was first featured in the 2003 film Johnny English and returned to life in 2011.
Will it become an ironic self-sacrifice about how we are obviously incapable of a new national export article?
In any case, incompetent Johnny English, with his distinctive imitation, had the opportunity to re-distort everything – signaling his name better than anything else that he was a cost-effective comic book designed especially for non-English viewers.
Of course, he is the immature secret agent who, despite his bizarre claim to a delicate charm, has a little bit of Clouseau, a stick from Mr Bean, and a spoonful of that guy who added a single tone to the opening melody of the 2012 Olymp Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony.
His character also originates from an international traveler and a mysterious man, whom Atkinson once played in today’s forgotten TV ads on Barclaycard, leaving chaos everywhere.
In this last adventure of Johnny English, one or two nice moments can be found.
I liked how Johnny English came to the helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the helicopter hits his tail slightly.
Atkinson’s talent for physical comedy appears here, but humor is a little sub-dimensioned and particularly superficial, especially when “serious” movie brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible themselves are now self-sufficiently offering comedy as one of their components.
Humor seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, and for me, Johnny English’s adventures are not as inventive and brilliant as Atkinson’s words-free gags in Mr. Bean’s character.
The current background of the film’s story is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker infiltrated the UK’s super-secret web-spyware network and, at the mercy of serving agent Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately lost a small role, revealed the identities of all British agents in the area.
This is the last drop for the prime minister, who is a pompous and combative character who is already on the brink of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing what she can with a character like Teresa May, but she has not much to work with in the script.
Her intelligence advisers tell her that if every active spy has been betrayed, she will have to call someone to retire.
Johnny English, now employed as a director at the same noble institution, gives private lessons on how to become a secret spy: here you will find a few pleasant gags as English gives lessons from espionage in the style of the School of Rock.
Englishmen are then called back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and meet their former long-time pitcher Bough, played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now a married man, attached to the affected submarine commander, whose role is Vicki Pepperdine a little bit of a shame.
So Batman and Robin, who are masters of the disaster in Her Majesty's secret service, are back in the full field and attack the beautiful femme fatale, Ophelia Bullet in a presentation by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously subject to the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: the malicious Jason Volta playing Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd pursuits: in disguise of bartenders they burn down a sweeping French restaurant; cause chaos when they crawl onto Volta's luxury yacht; and English dispels pure anarchy to learn the truth when he tries to try it.
All the tricks are pulling out of the sleeves in the last few minutes, but no matter how impressive and tumultuous, the whole thing works as little as a children’s TV show.
The whole impression is more or less average.
And like the other Johnny English movies, I still have to think about why the British film industry doesn’t finally give Rowan Atkinson a role that would match his talent?
Labourers support work on British four-week work week plan paid as five-day
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party should consider a radical plan that says Britain should have a four-week work week but get paid in five days.
The party allegedly wants the company’s leadership to redistribute the savings gained by the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution so as to give workers a day off.
This would mean that employees would have a three-day weekend, but they would have the same paycheck at home.
Sources claim that the idea would “respond” to the party’s economic plan to favour the country for the benefit of workers.
The transition to a four-week work week was supported by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from economic changes.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: “We expect the evaluation of the proposal to be published by the end of the year.
“It won’t happen from evening to morning, but a four-week work week is an effort that matches the party’s approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as with the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
Labourers would not be the first to support this idea. The Green Party has added a four-week work week to its 2017 election campaign.
However, the Labour Party as a whole is not surprised by the effort.
A Labour spokesman said: “A four-hour working week is not a party’s policy, nor does the party consider it.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week’s Labour Conference to advance his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell expressed his determination to regain power from “anonymous directors” and “riches” in services.
At the same time, the shadow office’s plans mean that current shareholders in water companies would not be able to regain their full shares because the Labour government could apply “reductions” due to the found infringement.
At the same time, he confirmed plans to recruit employees to corporate boards and set up Inclusive Own Funds so that 10 percent of the company’s private sector assets can reach employees who could thus earn annual dividends up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy at the 60 Minutes meeting to discuss whether the FBI’s investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week and raised the question of whether the findings of the office could influence some Republican senators to support their senators.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, 60 Minutes reporters Scott Pelley, Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked whether the FBI could reveal something to change their mind.
Kennedy acted more openly than his colleague from South Carolina.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“As I said when I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when it happened, when the charges were filed, and I asked, ‘Did you do that?’
He was determined, determined and unambiguous.”
However, Graham’s voice seems to be already firmly determined.
“I’ve already made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh, and there must be some inconsistent accusation,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett's got everything blown away," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“No one who mentions it can confirm it.
This thing is 36 years old.
I don’t see how something could change.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and how does it contribute to poverty reduction?
On Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York, an annual music event featuring an impressive crowd of stars with an even more impressive mission: to end world hunger.
At the age of seven, tens of thousands of people go to the Great Lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true goal of the 20th year event that will end the year.
The Global Citizen Festival, which took place for the first time in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
If viewers want to get a free event ticket (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), they must complete a series of tasks, or “actions”, such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to the world leader, a phone call, or any other meaningful person who is willing to pay for a VIP ticket.
There are still 12 years left, so how much does Global Citizen really do to achieve its goal?
Is it the idea of rewarding people with a free concert in a convenient way to convince them to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called “clickivism” – when people really feel they’re making a change when I sign an online petition or Twitter?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, more than 19 million “actions” have been recorded by its supporters, moving towards different goals.
These actions have helped motivate world leaders to declare commitments and policies worth more than <0x24>37 billion, which are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group said it had received 390 commitments and announcements from its shares, with at least <0x24>10 billion already being paid or picked up.
The group estimates that the funds so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the commitments are, for example, The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of UK-based investors and realtors who are committed to “helping children to reach their full potential,” promising to provide Rwanda with <0x24>700 million in tweets to help them live in the country, rather than the country.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and global citizens like you, we can make insufficient nutrition a thing of the past,” Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in Lond<0xC3><0xBD>.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling for improved nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for The Power of Nutition, which will provide 5 million women and children with nutrition contributions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on the website, “What do you think we can end extreme poverty on the basis of?”,
Global Citizen responded: “It’s going to be a long and challenging journey – sometimes we’ll fall and fail.
But just like the big civil rights and anti-apartheid movements ahead of us, we succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the characters who perform at this year’s New York event, along with the moderators Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use navy as a “block” to limit Russian energy exports, Interior Secretary says
"If necessary," Washington may call on its navy to prevent Russian energy entering markets including the Middle East, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke told the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said Russia’s involvement in Syria – where it acts to invite a legitimate government – is a prerequisite for the renewal of new energy markets.
"I am convinced that the main reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to trade in energy there exactly as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe," he said.
According to him, there are ways and methods to deal with it.
“The United States is able to ensure that seaways remain open, and, if necessary, to make a blockade to ensure that their energy is not available on the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to participants at the event, which is being held under the auspices of the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is taking the position of “energy consumers’ voice” in the United States.
He also compared Washington’s approach to Russia and Iran, noting that they are basically the same.
“The economic option against Iran and Russia is to make less use and replace fuels,” he said, noting that Russia has only one trick in its pocket because its economy depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration has embarked on a mission to support the export of natural gas to Europe and replace Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, representatives of the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which would make Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow, according to Trump.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the <0x24>11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is intended to double its existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s fierce opposition to the project is motivated by purely economic reasons and is an example of unfair economic competition.
"I am convinced that we have the same opinion that energy cannot be a tool for applying pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting with US Secretary of Energy in September in Perry.
The U.S. position brought Germany’s resistance, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, the German Industry Union (BDI), has called on the United States not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem with a third country intervening in our energy supplies,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Association (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will “think seriously” about the 2020 presidential nomination, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would “think seriously” about the presidential nomination after the standing elections.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider a candidacy.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that’s what a woman in the top position is demanding,” she told The Hill.
“After November 6th, I will seriously consider the presidential nomination.”
Warren said on President Donald Trump’s account during a council meeting that “it is leading this country in the wrong direction.
"Until the bone marrow, I'm worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren has openly expressed her criticism of Trump and his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, she tweeted, “Of course, we need an FBI investigation before we vote.”
However, a poll published Thursday showed that most of Warren’s own voters don’t think he should run in 2020.
According to a survey by the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe’s Political Research Center, 50 percent of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters said the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent would support her nomination.
The survey showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting his potential candidacy and 48 against.
Other well-known names among Democrats mentioned in connection with a potential 2020 nomination are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin speaks at Donald Trump’s PTSD Track Palin rally
Track Palin, 26, was taken to the army on September 11, 2007, and spent a year in Iraq.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"In addition to what my own son has been going through, since he returned, I have been able to connect with other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and the injuries our soldiers are going back with," Trump told spectators at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other war veterans that "they return home a little bit different, rougher, they come back with the question of whether people have respect for what their comrades and fellow statesmen and all the members of the country give to them."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against women, interference in reports of domestic violence, and possession of weapons under the influence of narcotic drugs, Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police department, said.
18 states and D.C. support opposition to new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support legal opposition to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum for victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and D.C. filed amicus curiae in Washington on Friday to support the opposition of asylum seekers to the new policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the applicant in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy was not disclosed.
She said her partner "and his sons, members of a violent gang," had abused her, but U.S. authorities rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
Representatives of the states that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, of which a high number of American asylum seekers come, as nations facing serious problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed the 2014 Board of Immigrant Appeals decision that allowed unregistered immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The District of Columbia Attorney General, Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a decision violates this principle,” said Amicus curiae.
Representatives further argued that a policy that denies immigration is detrimental to the U.S. economy because it is likely that they would become entrepreneurs and “add the necessary workforce.”
In June, General Prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered the immigration judge not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their home country for persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in a statement.
Asylum should never be destined to solve all the problems – even all the serious problems – that people face every day around the world.
The number of victims in Pala doubles and desperate efforts are underway to rescue those who survived
For the survivors, the situation has deteriorated steadily.
"It's very tense," says 35-year-old Risa Kusuma's mother while trying to swing her troubled son in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute, the ambulance is attached to the body.
“Clean water is rare.”
The inhabitants began to return to their destroyed homes, to drown in their flooded things, and to save everything that could be found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by a 7.5-degree earthquake burst in candles.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from fractures of the back and shoulders, rested in front of the Military Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside for severe follow-up injuries.
His eyes were tears when he remembered the feeling of the devastating earthquake that shook his hotel room on the fifth floor where he lived with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save.
I think the falling ruins pushed me to the wall," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the city for the wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, and then there was silence.
I don’t know what happened to her, or to my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of “Scanning” Through “Propaganda Advertising”
A week after official Chinese newspapers published a four-page advertisement in the U.S. daily promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador accused China of using U.S. pressure to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China Daily’s paid ad in the Des Moines Register — the state’s best-selling newspaper — after accusing China of wanting to interfere in U.S. elections to the congress on Nov. 6.
According to U.S. officials, Trump’s allegations against Beijing of attempting to interfere in U.S. elections are a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to develop pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to publish ads to support trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in a gradual trade war, in which both sides regulate tariffs on mutual imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs at the beginning of the trade conflict were to hit exporters in countries like Iowa that support Trump’s Republican side, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowy, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
As Branstad wrote in his contribution to the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register, “China has now doubled its bullying by publishing its promotional advertisements in our free press.”
“By spreading its propaganda, China is harnessing the American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of the press by publishing paid ads in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the contrary, in the newsstand on the streets here in Beijing you will find only limited disagreements and you will not expect any real picture of the diverse opinions that Chinese citizens may have on the problematic economic trajectory of China, as the media are under control of the party.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers refused to publish his offer" in his article, although he did not say which newspapers were concerned.
Analysts Warn Republicans Have Chances of Women Voters to Debate with Kavanaugh
As many leading Republicans support and defend candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who faces several charges of sexual assault, analysts warn that they will be pardoned in the upcoming interim elections, especially from women.
The emotions accompanying this case were extremely strong, and the majority of Republicans have already expressed their desire to join the vote.
“These things can’t be returned,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School University in Syracuse, told The Hill on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that a last-minute FBI investigation request from Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) would be enough to calm angry voters.
Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget it tomorrow, nor in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, an advisor and national spokeswoman for MoveOn, told the Washington newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, demonstrators chanted in the Senate hallways “November is approaching!” when Republicans in the Judicial Commission decided to continue Kavanaugh’s candidacy despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation transcend all borders,” Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, told the news portal.
“People say that motivation is already high, and that’s true.
But it could be even higher, especially among indecisive women voters in suburbs and younger voters aged 18 to 29 who do not like the president, but often do not like it.
Already before Ford’s public testimony, in which he gave details of his allegations of sexual harassment against the Supreme Court’s candidate, analysts suggested that there could be a sharp reaction if the Republicans confirmed their support for him.
“The GOP has become one of those big chaos,” former president of the Republican National Commission Michael Steele told NBC News earlier this week.
"It's not just a committee vote or a final vote, or whether Kavanaugh is basically on the table, it's also about how Republicans have taken up and treated it," Guy Cecil, the head of the U.S. Priorities Group, told reporters.
However, it seems that Americans are dissatisfied about who to trust at the dawn of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimonies, with the court adhering to Ford instead.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents certain or likely believed Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they certain or likely believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that according to them Kavanaugh probably or certainly during his testimony lied, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
The FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Commission under oath last week that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that a Supreme Court candidate discovered her genitals when she attended a dinner party during her studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Inventor Plans to Launch New Internet to Overcome Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the world wide web, is launching a startup that will want to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, called Inrupt, is a company that originates from Berners-Lee’s open-source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to decide whether their data is stored and who has authorised access to the individual information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind the Inrupt project was “to rule the world.”
“We have to get into it now,” he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "personal online data storage" or POD.
It can include contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and work tools.
It’s something like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify and all at the same time are available in a single browser.
On the personal online data store, it is unique that only the user decides who will have access to the individual type of information.
The company calls this “the exercise of personal powers through data.”
Inrupt’s intention, according to CEO John Bruce, is to bring resources, process and appropriate skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently forms Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform purchased by IBM, several internal developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer encoders.
From this week on, tech developers around the world could start creating their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team weren’t arguing with Facebook and Google about whether or not they’re going to make a complete change that overnight will completely reverse all of their business models.
“We don’t ask them for permission.”
In a post on the Medium portal published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new website built on the Solid platform."
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Priest Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Victory's Cross in the First World War
The only Anglican priest who was awarded the Victorian Cross as a warrior during World War I was celebrated on the 100th anniversary in his hometown.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann received the award on 29 September 1918 at the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a gunman four days later and never learned of the highest British military honour.
At a ceremony in Rushden, Northamptonshire, his two grandchildren unveiled a memorial plaque on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "awesomely symbolic" that the board was revealed exactly 100 years after his father's award-winning heroic fight.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann conducted his paper through the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through very dense darkness and strong fires of field weapons and fireworks."
Later, he hurried across the fire line and with the “highest courage” led the soldiers forward, destroying three of the field weapons himself.
Lieutenant Colonel Vanna was killed by a German gunner on October 4, 1918 – just a little over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his old father’s actions were “something I’ve never approached in my life, but it creates a deep sense of humility in me.”
Together with their brother, Dr. James Vann, they laid a wreath at the conclusion of the accompaniment, which led the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt "very honored to be able to participate in the accompaniment" and added that "the bravery of a real hero demonstrates the support that many people will express to him."
Fans of MMA waited until the end of the night for Bellator 206 and instead got the series Pig Peppa
Imagine staying up all night watching the exciting finale of the Bellator 206 and eventually not seeing the main event.
The San Jose schedule contained 13 matches, including six major matches, and it aired live throughout Channel 5 in the UK.
At 6:00 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were supposed to stand against each other, the rest of the audience in the UK were shocked when Peppa Pig appeared on the screen instead of the transmission.
Some were really disappointed because they waited until the morning specially because of this match.
One fan on Twitter described the switch to a children’s story as “some sick joke.”
“It’s a government regulation that this content has been inappropriate since 6:00, so they had to switch to a children’s program,” Dave Schwartz, vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, said in a statement.
“Yeah, it was ‘Praziatko Peppa’.”
Bellator President Scott Coker said they will work to ensure that their broadcasts can be watched by audiences in the UK in the future.
“When I think about repetitions, I think we’ll be able to solve it somehow,” Coker said.
“But it is Sunday at 6:00 a.m. their time and we will not be able to solve it before Sunday of our time, that is, Monday of their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it was too late, we exchanged a lot of messages and weren't really friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But no, it was a matter of government regulations.
I can promise you that it will not happen again in the future.
In short, in five games instead of six – as we usually have – we tried to give our fans something more and we pulled it out.
It's an unhappy situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels 'undervalued' for his sexuality
Olympic water jumper Tom Daley says he felt less valued for his sexuality during his adolescence – but that was what motivated him to become successful.
A 24-year-old athlete said he realized in high school that “not everyone is the same as me.”
In an interview on the first Desert Island Discs show on Radio 4, moderated by Lauren Laverne, he said he talked about gay rights to give others “hope.”
So he also said that when he became a parent, he began to care a little less about winning the Olympics.
The regular moderator of the long-lasting show, Kirsty Young, took a few months off from the disease.
As a developer in the first program with Laverne Daley, he said he felt “less than anyone else during adolescence because it was not socially permissible for boys and girls to be liked.”
In his own words, “Until today, I really felt less valued and different, and it gave me the strength and motivation to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “nothing,” he said, not to disappoint everyone after learning about his sexuality.
The double-bronze Olympic medalist became a leading LGBT rights fighter and used his performance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he spoke because he was fortunate to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give this “hope” to others.”
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with the man – American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – “it surprised him.”
Daley married an Oscar winner who is 20 years older than him last year, but says the age difference has never been a problem for them.
“When you live so much at a young age,” he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14, and three years later his father died of cancer, “it is difficult to find an equal who would experience similar successes and misfortunes.”
The couple became parents in June, their son Robert Ray Black-Daley was born, and Daley said that his "whole view of the world" had changed.
“If you asked me a year ago, I’d just talk about how I need to get a gold medal,” he said.
“And you know what, there are even bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father didn’t accept the idea of death and one of the last things he asked him was whether they had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics – because he wanted to be in the first place.
“I couldn’t tell him, Dad, you’re not here anymore so he can sit in the first place,” he said.
“I held him in my hand when he stopped breathing, and until he really stopped breathing and was dead, I was finally able to admit that he wasn’t immortal,” he said.
The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I knew that was exactly what I had dreamed of my whole life – jumping in front of a domestic audience at the Olympics, there’s no better feeling,” he said.
The story was also inspired by his selection of a song – Stream from Heather Small – that made him an impression in preparation for the Olympics and still causes him a winter scarf.
Desert Island Discs aired on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson in weak form set for Saturday's Ryder Cup matches
American Phil Mickelson will hit the record on Sunday when he will play his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to be in better shape so that it doesn’t make him a miserable milestone.
Mickelson, who plays at the two-year event for the record 12th time, was captain Jim Furyk at Saturday's fourball and foursome games.
Instead of being at the center of the diany, as many times before in the U.S., the five-fold winner spent the day in a row encouraging and improving his game in hopes of improving his reputation.
The 48-year-old didn’t shoot even at the top of his career, which is not ideal for the narrow Le Golf National, where the wrong arrows are usually retaliated in the long field.
And as if the pitch itself wasn’t a sufficient challenge, Mickelson faced in the ninth fight on Sunday the exact British Open champion, Francesco Molinari, who, in a pair with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood, managed to win all matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind the start of 12 individual matches, make a good start, Mickelson’s performance could be absolutely key.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but he could hardly say anything else.
"He fully understood his role today, hit me on the back, caught me around the mud and said he would be ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has high self-confidence.
He is a member of Siena’s fame and in the past and this week he has also greatly contributed to our team.
I couldn’t imagine playing two matches.
I imagined more, but this was how it got crossed, and we felt that this was exactly how we had to do it.
He wants to be outside on the lawn, just like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Fald's record in the highest number of Ryder Cup matches.
This could be the end of his career at the Ryder Cup, which never reached the sum of his individual balance.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 draws, although Furyk says his presence has brought the same incalculable value to the team.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s funny, he likes joking about people and he’s a great companion,” he said.
“I think even the younger players had a lot of fun with him and it was great to watch it.
His contribution is not just in his game.”
Captain Thomas Bjorn says strong leadership could soon be lost.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from his own experience that a significant lead when entering individual matches on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable ride.
The Danish golfer made his debut at the 1997 game in Valderrama, where the team, led by Captain Seve Ballesteros, had a five-point lead over the Americans, but still got through the goal line with the closest possible win of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2:131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“I always have to remember how we had a strong lead in Valderrama; we had a strong lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama we still won, but that’s the way it is,” Bjorn said in a photo after winning 5:3 on Friday and last night at Le Golf.
So the story shows me and everyone else in the team that the game is not over yet.
Tomorrow we'll go for a full gas.
We're going to get on the lawn and do everything right.
As long as there are no points in the table, the game is over.
We have our goal, and that is to win this trophy, that is what we need to focus on.
"As I say from the beginning, I'm focusing on 12 players on our side, but I'm just as well aware that we're standing against the other side - against the best players in the world."
Enthusiasmed at how his player was given a gift on a challenging golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never have predicted the event.
Tomorrow we will have another fight.
Tomorrow it will be about individual performance, and that’s something completely different.
It’s great to be on the pitch with your partner when you’re doing well, but when you’re standing there alone, it’s fully testing your golfing abilities.
This is a message that players need to remember to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now leave your partner and he has to go and get the best out of him.”
Unlike Bjorn, colleague Jim Furyk will want his players to play better as individuals than their partners. The exception is Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who earned three out of four points.
Furyk himself was at both ends of major tournaments on the last day when he was part of a winning team in Brookline before he ended up defeated when Europe reached "The Miracle in Medina".
“I remember every damn word,” he said in response to a question about how Captain Ben Crenshaw encouraged his players to the last day in 1999.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you would like to start quickly as you saw it in Brooklyn, as you saw it in Medina.
When this vibrational force explodes in one direction, it is especially important for those midfield matches.
We created our team and placed the boys in such a way that we felt we would try to do some magic tomorrow.”
Thomas was given the role to try to lead the fight and face Rory McIlroy in the top game, with other Europeans, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter in the top half.
“I went out with this group of boys in this order because I thought that’s how we’re going all this way,” Bjorn said.
Germany's new warship has been postponed.
Local media reports that the latest German naval frigate was to be put into service in 2014 as a replacement for aging warships from the Cold War, but this will not happen until next year due to faulty systems and accumulation of costs.
The launch of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", a completely new class of Baden-Württemberg frigates, was postponed for the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit citing a military spokesman.
The ship was due to join the navy in 2014, but the ambitious project suffered from the addition of worrying problems.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is known that they will contain powerful work, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft missiles, as well as some cover-up technologies, such as reduced radar reflectivity, infrared and acoustic traces.
Other important features include a longer maintenance periodicity – it should be possible to deploy the latest fregates for up to two years outside the domestic ports.
However, non-permanent delays mean that the most modern warships, which allowed Germany to demonstrate power overseas, will become obsolete by the time it comes into operation, the newspaper Die Zeit reports.
The unhappy F125 frigate got into the newspaper last year when the German navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the navy returned the ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media mentioned several key “software and hardware errors” that made the warship unusable when deployed on a combat mission.
Software shortcomings were particularly important, as the Baden-Württemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half of the workforce on the older Brême class frigates.
It has also been shown that the ship has a significant excess weight, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the navy to add future improvements.
The 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate ship is considered twice as heavy as a similar class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project – including the training of the crew – becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0x24>3.6 billion) – compared to the original <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems affecting the latest frigates are particularly important given the recent warnings that the German naval power is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German parliamentary defence committee, confirmed that the navy had "no ships capable of deploying".
The Government spokesman said that this question was raised over time because the old ships were dismantled but no replacement ships were provided.
He lamented that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates were able to join the navy.
The National Trust reveals the secret life of the netopies
The new research, which is underway in the Scottish Highlands, aims to reveal how non-topiers use the country in their food hunt.
We hope that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying tigers and help guide future activities to protect nature.
A study by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will follow non-smokers and non-smokers as well as light and water non-smokers in the Inverewe gardens in the Wester Ross area.
Special recorders are placed at key locations in the vicinity of the property to monitor the activities of the netopians throughout the season.
Employees of this organisation and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
A professional sound analysis of all recordings detects the frequency of calls of netopians and the activities of individual species.
They then create a map of their natural environment and management to create a detailed picture of their behavior on a large scale.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor for NTS, hopes that the findings of the discovery, which areas of the natural environment are most important for netopians and how they are used by different species.
This information will help determine the benefits of work in the field of environmental management, such as the formation of arcs and how best to preserve forests for meltwater and other related species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, the number of non-tobacco populations has declined considerably over the past few centuries.
They are endangered by construction and development works that affect grassland growth and loss of the environment.
Wind turbines and lighting, as well as aircraft and some chemical modifications of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats, can be dangerous.
Netopiers are not actually blind.
However, given their night hunting habits, their ears are like eyes when it comes to hunting benefits.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to accurately determine insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is not taking very seriously.
He has ten trained professionals, who regularly carry out surveys, inspections of gatherings and sometimes rescues.
The organization has even established the first and only reserved protected area for nettles on the Threa in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of nettle in Scotland.
The real estate manager, David Thompson, says that domination is the ideal territory for them.
"There's an amazing space for netopiers here in Threave," he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of protected trees and all good biotopes.
But there’s still a lot we don’t know about non-smokers, so the work we do here and on other real estate will help us better understand what they need to survive.”
It stresses that it is important to check the netopiers before carrying out maintenance within the real estate, because it is possible that the unconscious destruction of one maternal assembly could kill up to 400 females and youngsters, which would likely destroy the entire population.
Netopiers are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture, disrupt them, or destroy their communities.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official for the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to engage in the aid.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our non-smokers and many of our species simply don’t know how their populations live.”
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape, while lawyers filed a lawsuit against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo calls rape allegations “fake news” and says people want to be “visible” using his name.
His lawyers filed a lawsuit against the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
A Portuguese and Juventus assailant was accused of raping Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He then allegedly paid her <0x24>375,000 to shut up about the incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
A few hours after the charges were released, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke to his 142 million followers during a live Instagram interview and labeled the allegations as “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," said the five-time winner of the Golden Ball in the camera.
“They want to be seen by my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but it's part of my job.
"I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player added with a smile.
Lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for allegations they have called "an inadmissible report of suspicions in the privacy field".
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for “moral damages to an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident was supposed to take place in June 2009 in an apartment at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada, after a meeting at the Ronaldo and Mayorga nightclub, they allegedly went back to the player's room where he allegedly raped her.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was a “99 percent good guy” who lied about “one percent.”
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took a photo of her wounded in the hospital, but later agreed to an extraordinary settlement because she felt "feared of retaliation" and feared "public humiliation".
A 34-year-old woman says she is now trying to re-evaluate the deal because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United and this year moved to Italian giant Juventus with a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: the UK 'would always regret' the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would "forever regret" if it lost its status as a world leader in automotive manufacturing after Brexit, trade secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "concerning" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at a Burnastone factory near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of crossing borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit could reduce jobs.
Burnaston, which manufactures Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“In my view, if Britain leaves the EU by the end of March, we will stop production at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s chief executive officer in Burnastone.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed concerns about how the cross-border trade will work if they leave the EU without an agreement.
BMW, for example, says it will close its small race in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers refer to as the risks of the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is operated on a “just in time” basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU for cars made to order.
If the UK left the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be a breakdown of borders, which could lead to delays in the industry and a lack of shares.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than the daily value of the stock at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and production would thus stop.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's plan for future EU relations was "precisely calibrated to prevent these border controls."
“We need to have an agreement, we want to have the best deal that will allow us not only to talk about the current success, but to seize this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4 Today.
“The evidence not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, is that we must be absolutely able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota was unable to say for how long the production would stop, but in the long run it warned that the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately increase the cost of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnastone for 24 years and is a member of the trade union in the race, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, when these jobs disappear, they never return.
A spokesman for the government said: “We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed, says White House
An important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed for next week" as candidate Brett Kavanaugh's fight for the supreme court continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special legal representative Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, the ties between Trump’s advisers and Russia, and a potential margin of investigation by the president.
Whether Trump is ousting or not to fire the attorney general’s deputy, and this threatens Mueller’s independence, Washington has been down for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had been discussing the possibility of recording talks with Trump through the deputy and recalling the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein rejected this report.
Last Monday, he went to the White House, revealing new information that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would not “better” throw Rosenstein out, but then the meeting was cancelled to prevent a hearing with the Senate Judiciary Committee, which witnessed both Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of inappropriate sexual assault.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh, postponing the full vote of the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The deadline for this was not set, it could be this week, I understand a shift to another week in view of all the other things that happen to the Supreme Court.
We’ll see and always be happy to inform the press.”
Some reporters backed this claim: Sanders has not conducted a brief White House press conference since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of short press conferences was not caused by opposition to television reporters who want to starve, although she said, “I disagree with the fact that they want to starve.”
She then proposed to increase direct contact between Trump and the press.
“The president is holding more meetings based on the concept of questions and answers than any other president before him,” she added, without giving evidence: “Let’s look at those numbers.”
Short press conferences will still be ongoing, Sanders said, but “if the press has a chance to ask the question directly to the President of the United States, it’s incomparably better than talking to me.
We are trying to do this often and in the last few weeks you have seen us very often, there will be a brief press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly responds to questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with guest ranks.
Separate press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, when he presented himself freely and several times bizarrely to the gathered journalists.
Secretary of Health writes to EU staff at the National Health Service in Scotland for Brexit concerns
The health secretary wrote to EU employees working at the National Health Service in Scotland to express her country’s gratitude and wish to stay after Brexit is over.
Member of the Scottish Parliament Jeanne Freeman sent a letter less than six months before the UK's departure from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to pay the costs of applying for permanent residence of EU citizens working in the framework of its transferred public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU continued on a resignation to the expected decisions for the autumn.
However, the UK government has also accelerated its preparations for a possible non-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very worrying time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate once again how much I appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
“Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency operation after a head injury in Saturday's 31:27 defeat to Vanderbilt Commodores, according to Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State Reed chief coach told reporters he was injured just a half-hour ago.
“He came to the side line and crashed there,” Reed said.
Coaches and health personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before placing it on his nostrils and taking it for further examination.
A Tennessee State team official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was in the Vanderbilt health center after surgery.
Harris added that "there are no details about the type/range of injury" and the Tennessee State team is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year university student, is in his first season with the Tennessee State team after moving from Illinois.
On Saturday before leaving the game, he had five total interventions, bringing him a total of 18 interventions this season.
Overseas buyers will be charged a higher penny fee when buying a property in the United Kingdom
Overseas buyers will be charged a higher penny fee when buying a property in the United Kingdom, thereby obtaining additional cash to help homeless people under the new plans of the Conservatives.
This move neutralizes Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters
Tax increases will be collected from those who do not pay tax in the UK.
The State Treasury expects to increase to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
Theresa May will today announce that foreign buyers will be charged a higher helm fee when buying a property in the UK. Additional cash will be used to help homeless people.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s success, aimed at attracting young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing, and to target high-income people.
Increasing levies tax will be collected from individuals and companies that do not pay tax in the United Kingdom, additional funding supports the government in the fight against street sleepover.
The fee, which is in addition to the current penny tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second-houses and post-purchase real estate, could be up to three per cent.
The Treasury expects this move to bring up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built real estate in London is bought by residents who are not UK residents, which raises prices and complains to buyers who buy real estate for the first time to get into the housing system.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become “spirit cities” for a large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new strategy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in hips to help young people own their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping real estate prices high by talking about land but not exploiting it, and called on May to give up quotas for affordable housing to repair the British “householding.”
Corbyn announced a tour of a series of proposed housing reforms including rent control and termination of "uninvolved" migration.
At the same time, he wants to give the committee more power to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my function to restoring the British dream that life should be better for every new generation.
This is the consolidation of our broken market of living.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work, and build life here.
However, we cannot allow that for individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as for companies based abroad, it is as easy to buy homes as for hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become too far away and the indecency of sleeping on the street remains too real."
Jack Ross: "My main ambition is to lead Scotland"
Sunderland football team boss Jack Ross says his "final ambition" is to become Scotland's manager at a certain stage.
42-year-old Scotland enjoys a challenge to revive the Northeast club, which is currently third in the League One competition, three points from the first place.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after moving with St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a baseball cap and it was," Ross told BBC Scotland Sportssound.
“As a child, I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father, and that’s something that always pushed me back.
But this opportunity will only come if I’m successful in managing the club.”
Rossa's predecessors as Sunderland team managers include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic manager says he has no fear of following such a recognized name in such a big club because he has previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, success will be measured by whether I can bring this club back to the Premier League.
Due to the structure and equipment, this club is undoubtedly part of the Premier League," he said.
“Getting there is not an easy task, but I would probably consider myself successful if I could get there at the club.”
Ross is only three years in his managerial position, after a period when he served as assistant chief at Dumbarton and a 15-month-long run as coach at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from retreat to the third league and changed St Mirren from the retreat to the championship title winners the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable than ever during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real breakup," he recalled when he joined Alloa's team.
“I really believe that management is more appropriate for me than playing.
That sounds weird because I got a good gift, I got a good standard of living and enjoyed some reasonable maxims.
But playing can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you need to go through on a weekly basis.
I still do this when it comes to stress and pressure at work, but in management I feel good.
“I’ve always wanted to lead, and now I’m doing it, which makes me feel like I’m in the right place, like never before in my whole adulthood.”

Analysis reveals that the perfect time for a beer cup is on Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
Summer heaters have increased sales in British bars fighting for survival, but have increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The data revealed that the bars and bars sector saw a 2.7% increase in sales in July, but sales in restaurants declined by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, CGA’s business advisor, who compiled the data, said: “Continuing sunny weather and longer than expected England’s participation in the World Cup meant July followed a similar trend as the previous month, June, when sales rose by 8%, when sales fell by 2%.
The 1.8% decline in restaurants services in June only worsened in July.
The hostess with a range of drinks and a bar was given a much better gift than the restaurants, which, taking into account the same factors, recorded a decline.
The food supply bars also recorded a decline, although not as dramatic as the restaurant operators.
It seems that people just wanted to go for a drink.
In bars and bars, sales of beverages increased by 6.6% this month, with food falling by 3%.
RSM’s leisure and hospitality analyst Paul Newman said: “These results continue to be the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales on the domestic market.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups continue to compete, although the year-over-year market decline of 4.8 percent will be particularly painful given the ongoing cost pressures.
A long hot summer couldn’t come for operators with a supply of food at a worse time and time will show whether the milder temperatures we experienced in August will provide so much needed relaxation.”
Overall growth in markets in bars and restaurants, including new open shuttles, was 2.7% in July, reflecting a slowdown in the introduction of brands.

One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
Research has revealed that one in five children, some under the age of 11, have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the rise of “fake Instagram accounts”
Reports Increased Concerns About Releasing Sexual Content
Twenty percent of students say they have a “main” account to show their parents
One in five children, some under the age of 11, creates social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapid growth of “fake Instagram accounts” – which is a photo-sharing page.
Reports have raised concerns about the release of sexual content.
Twenty percent of pupils said they have an unprecedented “main” account that they show to their parents, and they have private ones.
One mother, who encountered the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter, found a teenage girl pressing others to rape her.
Research conducted by the UK’s Digital Awareness Organization and the Conference of Directors and Directors of Independent Schools (HMC) found that 40% of the population aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, with half of them admitting that they had sex.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online places where their parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of athletes" in the Scottish Athletics Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected as the non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Committee at the Annual General Meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle is the most successful athlete in Scotland and President Ian Beattie described this move as a great opportunity for those who run the sport to take advantage of its extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh has tremendous respect among the Scottish, British and world athletic communities and we are confident that Scotland’s athletics will benefit from bringing it to the board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I want to act as a voice of athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help to lead sports in Scotland.”
The American, who won 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and together has four Olympic gold medals and is a regular BBC commentator, has gone through a transitional ischemic attack and is now unable to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: “I suffered a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will show if I will recover and to what extent.
It’s exhausting work, but I managed to completely recover, I’ve learned to walk again and today I’m doing exercises for agility.
Thank you for the encouraging news!”
Advertising on breast milk vacuum comparing mothers with cows shares opinions in the online world
The company for the production of breastfeeding vacuum cleaners has shared opinions in the online world by comparing breastfeeding mothers with breastfeeding.
To mark the launch of the “most portable breast milk vacuum cleaner in the world”, consumer technology company Elvia has released an advertising inspired by post-Hudson music video to predict the freedom that the new breast vacuum cleaner gives to mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a long-filled barn with cows for a song that contains lyrics like, "Yes, I suck milk, but you don't see any breasts" and, "If you didn't notice that they're not pregnant, they're my breasts."
Refrén continues: “I pump, pump, feed such babies, pump, pump, absorb my beauty.”
However, the ad, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, opened up a controversy in the online world.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video sparked mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it despises the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
“It’s a very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
Just like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that we will steal their babies within a few days after giving birth," one woman wrote.

Another user commented: “It is, of course, traumatic for both the mother and the young.
But yes, why not use them to promote breast milk vacuum cleaners for mothers who leave their children?”
Someone else added: “Advertising torn from reality.”
Others defended the advertisement, with one woman admitting that the song seemed to her “spoken”.
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I'd buy a vacuum cleaner if I were still breastfeeding.
When I was drinking milk, I felt like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I take it the way it is.
It’s a great product,” one woman wrote.
Another user commented: “A funny advertisement aimed at mothers who suck up milk (often in their workplaces or in the toilet) and feel like ‘cows’.”
This is not advertising that is praised or judged by the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they were all dancing with discreet suction cups on breast milk wrapped in bra.
The campaign concept is based on an understanding of the essence that many women who drink milk say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvia breast milk vacuum cleaner is completely quiet, has no wires or tubes and is discreetly fit in the breastfeeding bra, which gives women the freedom of movement, the ability to hold children and even suck and spend time outdoors.
Ana Balarin, a partner and mother in the Early Childhood Development program, commented: “Elvia’s breast milk vacuum cleaner is such a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and provocative marketing.
By drawing a parallel between the expression of women and nurses, we wanted to place the suction of breast milk and all its challenges at the center of attention, while in a fun and expressive way to demonstrate an incredible sense of freedom that new suctions.
It’s not the first time Elvie’s vacuum cleaner has appeared in the headlines.
During Fashion Week in London, the mother of two children appeared at the showcase for designer Mart Jakubowska, using this product.
Hundreds of immigrant children peacefully moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of immigrant children detained has increased, even though monthly cross-border transitions have remained relatively unchanged, in part because the hard rhetoric and procedures introduced by the Trump administration have complained about the placement of children thanks to sponsors.
Traditionally, the majority of supporters were illegal immigrants themselves, and they feared that it would endanger their ability to remain in the country by acting as a child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential supporters and other adult members of their households would have to submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Chief Immigration and Customs Control Officer Matthew Albence said in front of Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had requested support for unaccompanied minors.
The authorities later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees did not have previous criminal records.
“About 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or members of the family of sponsors are illegal in the country, and a large number of them are foreign nationals with criminal records.
So we continue to monitor these individuals,” said Mr. Albence.
Officials attempting to process matters concerning children more quickly have introduced new rules, which will require some of them to be brought to court within one month of their detention and not 60 days as per the previous standard of labour.
Many will present themselves through a video conference call and not in person to present their case in connection with the legal status of the immigration judge.
Those who will be classified as not eligible for assistance will be deported quickly.
The longer the children are detained, the more likely they are to fall short of anxiety or depression, which can lead to an outbreak of violence or attempts to escape, the workers in the shelter and reports that have appeared in the system in recent months.
Advocates said these concerns are increasing in larger devices such as Tornillo, where the symptoms of a child suffering are more overlooked due to the size of the device.
They added that moving children to the tent town without giving them enough time for emotional preparation or to say goodbye to friends could cause a trauma that many struggle with.
Syria urges U.S., French and Turkish "occupied forces" to withdraw immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moual, who has addressed the UN General Assembly, also urged Syrian refugees to return home despite the war in the country for eight years.
Moual, who also serves as the Deputy Prime Minister, said foreign forces in Syria were illegally under the pretext of combating terrorism and "we will deal with them accordingly".
"They must be withdrawn immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that “the war on terror is almost over in Syria.” Since 2011, more than 360,000 people have died and millions have been expelled from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight in this sacred battle until it clears all of Syria's territory" from both terrorist groups and "illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and radioing Kurdish forces as well as Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in a war-torn country.
With regard to the issue of refugees, Moualem said the conditions were appropriate for their return and accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fear", which led refugees to stay out of their homes.
“We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian problem.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone in the last major Idlib rebel stronghold has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has deterred a large-scale attack by Syrian-backed forces on the province, which is home to three million people.
Moual, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would be aimed at jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra front linked to al-Qaeda, which is "deleted".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that he will soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members with a view to developing a post-war constitution for Syria and preparing the ground for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the group's work should be limited to "revising the articles of the current constitution" and warning against interference.
Why Trump Got a Second Functional Period
With this logic, Mr Trump would win the 2020 re-election, even though many liberal spectators are likely to hope that his presidential office will end the accusation and scandal prematurely.
This would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of the presidential office at all”!
There are no signs of tiredness of the audience.
Since 2014, the average time tracking on CNN has more than doubled to 1.05 million, and on MSNBC it has almost doubled to 1.6 million.
The TV network Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in mainstream time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, Nielsen said, and "The Show with Rachel Maddow" on MSNBC has a top rating with up to 3.5 million viewers in mainstream media evenings.
"This is a journey that attracts people because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, the creator of the drama program "President in Order" on ABC about a government secretary who will become president after an attack that will destroy the Capitol.
Nell Scovellová, experienced author of comedies and relationships "Just the Funny Parts: And Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys <0xCC><0x81> Club", has a new theory.
Before the 2016 election, he remembered driving a taxi in Boston.
The leader told her he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'cause he's funny,' said Scovell.
In this chaos there is a fun value.
Of course, unlike everything else on television, stories from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade’s dispute over whether immigrant families will be able to reunify and the health of the global economy.
Ignorance is a luxury that only privileged spectators can afford.
But it’s beyond the informed citizen’s scope when you find that you’re watching a six-hour expert group talk about “deeper background” as the source of Bob Woodward’s “Fear” book, the bomber’s coat of arms, Paul Manafort’s Post, the <0x24>15,000 doughnut, the Washington doughnut, and the description of the <0x24>15,000 doughnut (Daniel).
I’ll never look at Super Maria again in the same way.

When I came to Mr. Fleiss this week, the outside of the north bank of Kauai was sunny 26 degrees, but it was kept inside by watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He couldn’t stand it, not with Brett Kavanaugh, who was set up before the Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was uncertain.
“I remember when we made all those crazy performances in the past and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was just some joke, but it turned out he was right.”

Money flows outside in chair elections in the middle of the term
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th district is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to the redistribution of congressional districts, which resulted in two candidates falling to a single chair.
This recently proven suburban district of Pittsburgh stands in opposition to Democratic candidate Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in the special elections last spring.
Lamb is running against another official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is heavily overlapping with the new 17th district.
The maps rewritten after the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally manipulated for the benefit of Republicans.
The fight in the new 17th district affected the financing of the campaign between the main party financial weapons, the Congressional Committee for the Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the National Committee for the Republican Campaign (NRCC).
Lamb became famous in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the widely watched March special elections to the 18th congressional district in Pennsylvania.
The city has been held by the Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump has won the district by 20 points.
Political commentators gave Democrats a slight boost.
US considers penalizing El Salvador instead of supporting China, then resigns
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with a small deviation from Washington.
Trump attended a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varel of Panama in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama until his partners emigrated to the Trump leadership organization.
State Department officials have decided to appeal to U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for “recent decisions that no longer recognize Taiwan,” ministry spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement.
But sanctions were only taken into account against El Salvador, which received aid in an estimated <0x24>140 million in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and its high rate of unemployment and raids.
As internal meetings continued, the representatives of North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to push ahead with a similar meeting last year, which was considered a step forward in an effort to prevent migrants from being targeted.
In mid-September, however, the top administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to move forward and effectively end any assessment of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now addressing the conference, which is scheduled for mid-October, in recognition of the importance of the meeting that the administration suits him, the diplomats said.
U.S. ambassadors have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new serious reports or penalties from Washington.
A White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of Mr. Bolton's debate, which was described by U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal negotiations under conditions of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke for conditions of anonymity.
Study the stories.
Another unexpected event could be the report by special adviser Robert Mueller on a possible obstruction to President Trump’s justice, from which there is now very significant evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller also allegedly turned his inquiry into whether Trump’s campaign was linked to Russia in the attack on our elections.
If Congress changed the party, Mr. Trump would face responsibilities in this body just as he is preparing to go back before voters and perhaps even the jury of his Snowboarders.
That’s a lot of conditions, if I don’t suggest that Trump’s fall is inevitable – nor its equivalent in Europe.
Each of us on both sides of the Atlantic has a choice of how it can affect the extension of the battle.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to carry out a coup against Hitler, but the West would have to resist him and support the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We did not succeed and we missed the opportunity to avoid the year of the massacre that followed.
The course of history revolves around such inflexible points, and the relentless course of democracy is accelerating or declining.
Americans are now facing some of these inflexible points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since it was announced in this report that he proposed a secret recording of the president last year and speculated about his inability to run the office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the explanation of The Times is inaccurate.
“How will we respond if the newly demanded investigation by F.B.I. Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or just – or if he is accepted to the Supreme Court despite credible charges of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And most importantly, will we vote in mid-term in Congress to take responsibility for Trump?
If we fail in these tests, democracy will be saved for a fairly long winter sleep.
I do not believe that we are failing because of the lessons I have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jewish woman who was deported to Osvine<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light a Sabbath candle on that hooked cross table.
With such a past, I just have to be optimistic.”

Graham Dorrans from Rangers feels optimistic before meeting with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday and know that a victory over the Austrians in the wake of an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month will put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G in the Europa Lea competition.
The knee injury prevented defender Graham Dorrans from presenting himself for the first time in the season, only after a 2–2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a reflective bridge for bigger things.
“It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We went into the game and we thought we could get something and we left with a point.
We may have been able to achieve this in the end, but overall, the draw was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we showed up more in the second half and were a better team.
The next big European night will be on Thursday.
Let’s hope we can get three points, but it’s going to be a tough game because they had a good result in their last game, but with the fans behind us I’m sure we can push them and get a positive result.
“Last year was definitely tough given my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a factor in the game why we feel good.
This is good and the boys really enjoy it, we have a great training.
Let’s hope that we’re pushing the past season backwards and we’re going to be successful.”
Women don't sleep for fears associated with retirement savings
Despite the fact that the respondents had a clear idea of how they wanted to take care of them, few people spoke to their family members.
Approximately half of the people in the nationwide study said they were talking to their partners about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with their children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but ineffective steps to talk about them,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance for Nationwide.
Here is the point where to start.
Talk to your partner and children: You can’t prepare your family for caring if you don’t present your wishes to them in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how to get care, as this choice can be an important factor in determining costs.
Bring your financial advisor: Your advisor can help you figure out a way to pay for these expenses.
Your long-term care financing options may include a traditional long-term insurance contract, a hybrid life insurance contract that will help cover these expenses or self-insurance with your own assets – as long as you have that money.
Develop your legal documents: Avoid legal battles in a crisis.
Get a Healthcare Officer to identify a trusted person who will supervise your health care and ensure that professionals meet your wishes in the event that you will not be able to communicate.
Also consider the strength of a legal representative for your finances.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your accounts are paid if you are unable to.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your parent requires urgent medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Rather, these details in a written plan so that you are prepared.
“It’s not just about the money, but who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
“What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Keep this plan in place.”
Multiple man shot with air rifle in Ilfracombe
The man was shot several times with an air rifle when he left the house at night.
The forty-year-old was shot in the chest, belly and hands in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon.
The police described the shooting, which took place at about 2:30 a.m. BST, as a "accidental act".
She did not see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are urgently looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a severe earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said the death toll is expected to increase.
As a result of dangerous communication, humanitarian officials were not able to obtain any information from the regent's office in Donggala, the region north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-foot magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about the cities of Palu and Dongala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and a tsunami.
Donggala is a regent of stretching more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coast on the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The Regency, an administrative region belonging to the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main support of the economy of the central province of Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian disaster mitigation agency, the cities of Palu and Donggala have been hit by a tsunami several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggal.
The tsunami also struck the western part of Donggala in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia lies seismicly in the Pacific Fire Circle and earthquakes regularly hit it.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A large earthquake on the western coast of Aceh Province in Indonesia in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami on 26 December that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of heavy earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias on the Sumatra coast.
2006: An earthquake of magnitude 6.8 hit the southernmost island of Indonesia, Java, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coastline and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: Near Padang, the capital of the Western Sumatra province, there was an earthquake of magnitude 7.6.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 hit one of the islands of Mentawai, outside Sumatra, and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters, destroying dozens of villages and killing approximately 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake hit the Pidie Jay Regent in Aceh, causing devastation and panic when people were reminded of the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people died as a result of the collapse of buildings.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and resulted in the temporary detention of thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested and charged with the attack.
A 29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on Tuesday on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in the execution of a report of domestic violence and resistance to detention, according to an Alaska state driving police report.
According to the police report, when his friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, she picked up her phone.
Palin remains imprisoned at the investigative facility in Mat-Su and is detained on an uncovered bond of <0x24>500, KTUU television station reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, stating in his defense that "he's not guilty, of course," the television station said.
Palin faces three A-class offences, which means he could be imprisoned for up to one year and receive a fine of <0x24>250,000.
He was also charged with Class B crime, sentenced to one day in prison and fined <0x24>2,000.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Veterans Court in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic assault, interference in a criminal report of domestic violence and gun ownership while in a state of intoxication in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans in 2016 after linking her son’s violent behavior with PTSD resulting from his service in Iraq.
Tsunami earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds dead
At least 384 people died in an earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electrical networks and communications networks are not functioning, with an increase in the number of deaths expected in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near the central part of Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
On social networks, videos are circulated that show the moments of the collision.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when a tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, a suspected terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people - a rare sentence that has not been found guilty of a federal crime in the state since 1953.
30-year-old Saipov allegedly used the rented Home Depot truck on October 31 to carry out a cycling attack along the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan, causing pedestrians and cyclists to strangle on the route.
According to the announcement of the start of the death penalty trial filed in New York’s southern district, if prosecutors want to attain the death penalty, they will have to prove that Saip “intentionally” killed eight victims and “intentionally” caused a serious injury.
For both of these cases, the death penalty is awarded according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal Investigation Jury filed a 22-point indictment against Saip, which included eight charges of murder with intent to extortion, which are usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of motor crime, and criminal offences.
The attack required “substantial planning and cold-blooded thinking,” prosecutors said, and the way Saipov executed it was described as “horrible, cruel and perverse.”
“Sayfullo Habibulaevic Saipov caused injury, injury and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernán Ferruchi, Hernán Diego Mendoza and Alejandra Pagn.”
Piati of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since the Southern District of New York passed the death penalty for the last time.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but in September 2009 he was eventually sentenced to life in prison.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York City in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. The couple was executed after being convicted of conspiracy and espionage for the benefit of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both were executed on an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, according to court documents in the following days and months after the attack proved a lack of clearance of conscience.
He told the investigators that he was feeling good about what he had done, police said.
According to the complaint, Saipov said he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
Police said he had also asked for the ISIS flag to be displayed in his hospital room.
At the address of the 22-point complaint, he declared that he was not guilty.
David Patton, one of the federal public advocates representing Saipov, said they are "obviously disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of admitting guilt and life spent in prison without the possibility of being released only extends the trauma of these events to all participants,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative MP Says Nigel Farage Should Be Responsible For Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the People's Army" during a protest at a conservative conference.
The former leader of the UK’s Independence Party said politicians had to “find an unpleasant situation” from Euroskeptics — when one member of parliament, Theresa May, suggested that he be in charge of negotiating with the EU.
Conservative council member Peter Bone said in Birmingham in March that the United Kingdom would be “already gone” if Mr Farage were the secretary of the Brexit.
But the challenge that Mrs May faces in alleviating her deeply divided ranks has been emphasized by conservatives with a view to staying, who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to maintain a compromise plan amid attacks by Brexit supporters, withdrawal supporters and the EU.
The Allies insisted that it would continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the opposition – and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and “chaos”.
Mr. Bone said at the Leave Means Leave group meeting that he would like to suspend the prime minister.
He proposed to Mr Farage that he be involved and responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If we had it, we would have been out there,” he said.
A member of parliament for Wellingborough added: “I am in favour of Brexit, but we need to suspend the prime minister.”
He expressed his disagreement with the EU, saying: “We did not fight in world wars to be subordinated.
We want to make our own laws in our country.”
Mr. Bone rejected the opinion that since the 2016 vote, public opinion has changed: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is completely false.”
Andrea Jenkyns, a conservative supporter of Brexit, was also on the road and told reporters: “I’m simply saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The Prime Minister is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for her, it is unpopular with our party and our activists, who actually storm the streets and get us first.
Please let the Prime Minister do this and start listening.”
In a press release for Maya, she added: “The prime ministers keep their seats when they keep their promises.”
Farage said at the assembly that politicians must “feel anger” if they betray the decision from the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a question of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them that we won’t let them.”
“I want our political class, which is on the verge of betrayal of Brexit, to feel our anger,” he said.
“We are mobilizing the people of this country who gave us victory in Brexit and we will never give up until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
In the meantime, people marched through Birmingham for maintenance, and then held a two-hour meeting in the city center.
The number of activists had a banner of the Conservatives against Brexit. The group was founded this weekend.
Labour Party member Lord Adonis ridiculed conservatives for security issues with the party application at the start of the conference.
"These are people who tell us that they can have established information systems and all technologies for a border-free zone and for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
“It’s a complete phrase.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to “rethink” the presidential nomination
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will carefully reconsider her running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a council meeting on Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election against state Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chairman of Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
It was speculated that Trump could be defeated in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting at the council from Trump’s admission to office.
He asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren said it was “time for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, and that also requires a woman in the top position.”
Arrested in the shooting of Sims from LSU University
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Saturday said they had arrested a suspect in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayden Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department has announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, a 20-year-old, at 11 p.m. at the ET press conference.
They posted a video of Friday's shooting and asked for help identifying the man who was captured on the video.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near the University of Southern Internate on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to his head and eventually died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday via the 247sports network.
Wayde went to help his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being present, carrying a gun, and confessed to shooting Wayden Sims.
Simpson was imprisoned and imprisoned in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The two-metre junior, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games with 10 starts last season with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix in Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after his team’s orders brought him victory over Sebastian Vettel
Since Valtteri Bottas qualified against Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it has been announced that Mercedes’ orders will play a significant role in the races.
From the best starting position, Bottas got a good start and almost got Hamilton into an unpleasant situation when defending his position in the first two corners and calling Vettel to attack his fellow player.
Vettel first got into the boxes and left Hamilton to get into the group's lead, which was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes went to the boxing stop a little later and went after Vettel, but Hamilton continued after a tight run in which the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside with the risk of having to defend himself for the third time after the second draw.
Max Verstappen on his 21st birthday started in the back row and was seventh until the end of the first round.
He then led much of the race by sticking to the road and aiming for a quick finish, bypassing Kimi Raikkonen and reaching fourth place.
He eventually entered the boxes in the 44th round, but was unable to increase his pace in the remaining eight rounds, so Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was a tough day because Valtteri worked fantastically all weekend and was a real gentleman and let me go around.
He has done an exceptional job, he has an exceptional combination of two strong personalities," Hamilton said.
It was a really bad word for the body.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday for not publishing a letter from Christine Blasey Ford, accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
When the president spoke at an assembly in West Virginia, he did not deal directly with the testimony given by Ford before the Senate Judicial Committee, instead noting that what is happening in the Senate has shown that people are "repulsive, resentful and dishonest."
“One thing that could happen, and that beautiful thing that’s happening in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and hungry and disgusting and dishonest,” he said.
When you look at the releases and the leaks and they say, "Oh, I didn't do it."
I'm a neurobiologist."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you publish it?
Remember her answer... you published the document – “oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
All right, wait a minute.
We have published... No, we have not published,” he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein received a letter detailing Ford’s allegations against Kavanaugh in July, and the letter was released in early September, but Feinstein denied that the escape was coming from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s claims, I didn’t publish her story,” Feinstein told The Hill.
“She asked me to consider it confidential and I kept it as confidential as she asked me.”
However, it does not appear to have been supported by the president, who said at a meeting on Saturday: “I’ll tell you what, it was really a bad word of the body.
Maybe she didn’t, but she had the worst body word I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing in defense of the Supreme Court candidate, accused by three women of inappropriate sexual conduct, the president indicated that the Democrats used the claims for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take over the power with all the necessary means.
You see the indecency, the dishonesty, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to overcome to gain power and control,” the mediaite reported on the president’s statement.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5:3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals behind the Giants against the Dundee hockey team
The Dundee Stars lost to the Belfast Giants on Friday by winning a revenge game in Dundee with a score of 5:3.
The Giants won an early two-point jump thanks to Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Thanks to Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cowne, the domestics were equilibrated, but Dwyer subsequently restored the Giants leadership.
Francois Bouchard scored for Dundee, but subsequently gave Lukas Lundvald Nielsen two goals to secure their victory.
It was the third loss of the Elite League season for Adam Keefe's men who turned the scores and beat Dundee 2:1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth match of the season between the Super Bowls that the Giants won in the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute at 3:35 p.m. with Kendall McFaull assist and four minutes later David Rutherford assisted when Beauvillier doubled the lead.
During the busy opening part, Sullivan returned home at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt secured Cownie's leveling at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants led to the first break when he scored his second goal that night at the end of the first quarter.
The home runs over and Bouchard scored again with a goal during the game without a goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen for the first time in the match to secure Dundee's lead in the second half and he took care of the win in the half of the last half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at home at Milton Keynes in the next game on Friday.
Flight Operator Dies to Ensure Flight Escape With Hundreds of Passengers Before Earthquake
The airline operator in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he died after ensuring a safe take-off of a plane carrying hundreds of people.
More than 800 people have died and many of them are unfaithful after a major earthquake hit Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Strong octopuses continue to haunt the area and many people are trapped in trouble in the city of Palu.
Despite his colleagues fleeing to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his place in the wild moving tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained in place to ensure that flight 6321 Batik Air, which was on track at the time, would take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was going to collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
Indonesian air navigation spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision had saved hundreds of lives, Australia’s ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning when the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“We were very sad when we found out,” he added.
Meanwhile, experts fear that the number of casualties could reach thousands. The country's Disaster Relief Agency says there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Siga and Boutong.
“The number is likely to steadily increase because many bodies were still in trouble and we couldn’t reach many people,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroh, a spokesman for the agency.
The waves, which reached up to six meters, devastated Pala, where a mass funeral takes place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are delivering aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute a ambulance attaches the body.
Clean water is very rare.
“Small markets are everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help others, but we don’t know what we’ll find there.
It’s a tragedy, but it can get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo came to Palu on Sunday and said to the army in the country: “I urge all of you to work day and night to complete all tasks related to evacuation.
“Are you ready?” said CNN.
Earthquakes hit Indonesia earlier this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Airplane crash in Micronesia: According to Air Niugini airline, one man is unfaithful after a plane crash in the lagoon
The airline operating the flight, which crashed into the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, says it is an unfaithful man, after having previously said that he had safely evacuated all 47 passengers and crew from a dive plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that it found that one man was missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more detailed information about passengers, such as their age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water when it attempted to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
What caused the accident and what was the exact trace of the events remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane had landed in the lagoon before the start of the landing route.
Some witnesses thought the plane was off the runway.
American traveler Bill Jaynes said the plane flew very low.
“It was a lot of luck,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others had been able to cross the deep water belt to the emergency exits in a drowning plane.
He said the planes were panicking and screaming and had suffered minor head injuries.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working close to improving the moat also helped rescue by using an inflatable boat that they had taken people to shore before the plane sank to about 30 meters (100 feet) below.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network database indicates that in the past two decades, 111 people have died in PNG-registered airline accidents, but Air Niugini was not involved in any accident.
Analyst determines the time axis of the night during which a woman was burned alive
The lawsuit ended Saturday in a re-opened lawsuit against a man who is accused of imprisoning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
It was designed for the jury as it used cell phone records to connect the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Rowlett said he had obtained location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, which was contrary to his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at a time when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, with Chambers, police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and confirmed that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "laughing because my car was in Nashville."
Another controversy was that Tellis said he met Chambers about two weeks after she died.
The cell phone records showed that they only met for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after the death of Jessica Chambers, Tellis deleted her messages, calls, and contact information from her phone.
“He wiped her out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense plans to present the final allegations on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the court to go the day before the jury.
The High Breed: What is Hip-Hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of this genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed group from Bristol claims that hip-hop has deviated from its origins in political messages and solving social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and re-popularize their conscious hip-hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common experience fame in the UK again through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
The next black one?!
New York nurse sues couple for statement after ‘racist’ text message
A New York nurse is suing a couple for discriminatory expulsion from work after receiving a wrongly sent text message from a mother who complained she was "another black woman".
The couple argue that they are racist, comparing the lawsuit to “disappearance.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her grief when she found out that the new babysitter of her children, Giselle Maurice, was black when she first came to work in 2016.
"NIEEEEEEEEEE, THE NORTH OF BLACK" wrote Plasco-Flaxman in a text message to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Miss Maurice.
According to the New York Post, after the "shameful" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman realized her passing, she threw Mrs. Maurice away, and said that the leaving nurse, who was an African-American, had done her bad job and that she was expecting her instead of Filipín.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for one day of work and then sent home by Uber.
Ms. Maurice now sues a couple for compensation for dismissal and demands a compensation of <0x24>350 a day for a six-month period, for work with the employer she was originally hired for, even without a contract.
“I want to show them that things like that are not happening,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
A couple oppose the claims of being racist, defending and defending that the termination of Ms. Maurice's employment was a reasonable thing because they feared they could no longer trust her after she was insulted.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racists," Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you give your children into the hands of someone you were rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
But go."
Comparing the lawsuit to Plasco’s “dismissal,” Plasco said that his wife had a child of only two months and was in a “very difficult situation”.
“Would you go after someone like that?
That’s not a very nice thing,” added the investment banker.
While the court case is still ongoing, the public quickly condemned a couple on social media, affecting their behavior and logic.
New paper reveals that Paddington publishers are worried that readers will not have a relationship with a speaking bear
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after receiving the book, said of the letter: “It is difficult to find yourself in the skin of someone who read it for the first time before publishing.
It’s very fun to know what we know now about Paddington’s huge success.”
She said that her father was an optimist in connection with the rejection of his work. Before he got the idea and wrote a children's book about a little bear, he worked as a cameraman for the BBC. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book's release was "sweet" for his death last year.
She added that Paddington’s potential success, which she describes as “a very important member of our family,” was quietly proud of her father.
“He was a very peaceful man and was not a praiser,” she said.
“But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who achieved something: you’re proud of it, even if it’s not really your cause.
I think that's how he perceived Paddington's success.
Though it was his creation and his imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself.”
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye on the phone
After landing, she and her daughter rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“He called me on a regular basis to tell me that it was really bad, that we didn’t expect him to do it,” Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then Nad called me and told me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did it.
I said, “Tashi, I love you very much, sweetheart.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines that doctors gave her to keep her heart functioning slowly matured and left her system.
She died a short time ago, and that's how it ended.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was going on.
I couldn’t even cry, cry or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold on.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now saddened by the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane with the other passengers – regardless of the suffering she had experienced.
“No one knew about it,” she said.
“I had my head slipped and cried all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but during the summer I felt tremendous sympathy with Nad.
I realized that she needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women's Relationships Prevent Suicide on Bridge
Two women who have come to suicide about their loved ones are trying to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place links to the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to get support.
Mrs. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want a parent to experience what I have to experience every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile would light up every room.
However, he gave up his work before he died, because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his cousin after taking his life.
Mrs Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that this will have a chain effect."
Mrs. Davis created links, “to let people know that there are people you can come to and talk to, even when it’s about a friend.
“Don’t sit still, you have to talk.”
A longtime friend of Mrs. Davies, Mrs. Humphreys, lost Mark, a partner he was with for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he was feeling bad or depressed or otherwise,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
On the Day of Resurrection it was a perfect day - when the children opened their gifts, they did not even look at them or anything else."
She said his death was a huge trauma for them, but they must get through it: “It will create a hole across the entire family.
It's happening to us.
But we all have to go on and fight.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is uncertain because the FBI is investigating
“I thought that if we could really achieve something that was required – a timely or largely limited investigation – we could agree on something,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was concerned that the commission would “disintegrate” in the middle.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance is caused by timing.
Elections in the middle of the term are only five weeks away, November 6 – if, as expected, Republicans will not succeed, then a significant weakening in their efforts will get the man they chose to get to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call a senator, lobbied to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush, and through him he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI is working on the report?
In the Senate, there will be a vote of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to change the indecisive outcome and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
North Korea’s number of deserters ‘slows’ under Kim’s rule
The number of North Korean deserters in South Korea has been declining since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, South Korean lawmakers said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, said there were 1,127 deserters last year – compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that the key factors are stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates charged by the carriers.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean deserters will eventually be offered by South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most will flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than a heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters to be illegal migrants rather than refugees, and often violent returns.
Relations between the North and South, which are still technically at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, representatives of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks aimed at suspended denuclearisation talks.
This happened after the historic June meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they broadly agreed to work on a nuclear-weapon-free peninsula.
However, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho said on Saturday that insufficient progress was caused by US sanctions.
“Without any trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and in such circumstances, there is no way that we would disarm ourselves unilaterally first,” Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and says she is unable to serve in the Supreme Court
Senate minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said his temperament was unsuitable for service in the Supreme Court.
This is what Pelosi said in a Saturday interview at the Texas Recreation Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help myself, but I think if a woman did, they’d say she’s ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Mr. Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christina Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his inaugural speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and shivering when discussing his family and high school period.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the charges against him a "gross and coordinated type of assassination" organized by liberals angry over Hillary Clinton's loss in the 2016 presidential election.
Mrs Pelosi said she believes that Kavanaugh’s testimony proves that she cannot serve in the Supreme Court because she turns out to be interested in the Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with these statements and the way he pursues the Clintons and Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi was avoided when asked if she would try to accuse Kavanaugh if his nomination was confirmed and if Democrats gained a majority in the House of Representatives.
"If he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not just fit to be in the Supreme Court, but also to be in the court he's in right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the District Court of Appeal in D.C.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh’s potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or in the Roe v. Wade case because she is considered a conservative judge.
In his hearings, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would reverse any decisions of the Supreme Court.
“It’s not the time for a hysterical, busy man to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Well, isn’t that wonderful?’” Pelosi said.
And women have to control it.
It’s a legitimate attack, months and years of resentment that can’t be held back, and she can’t talk about it without crying.
“When we get hot, we cry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s unusual, do I?”
She continued: “A woman who was a manager somewhere helped me a lot, and she said she was also crying when she got angry, but she started using the procedure that when she got angry and started crying, she told the person she was talking to, because I thought, ‘You might be crying.
I hate myself.’
And then she just went on.
I think it's great."
Tears are partly allowed as a way out of anger, because they are extremely incomprehensible.
One of my clearest memories of an early job in a mostly male office, where I once cried out of indescribable ugliness, is when my older wife, a cool manager, whom I was always a little afraid, caught behind the back and pulled me out of the ladder.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re shaking.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be glad they got under your skin.”
Patricia Schroeder, a later Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, collaborated with Gary Hart on his fight for the presidency.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught on an extramarital affair aboard a ship called Monkey Business and ended his candidacy, deeply frustrated Mrs. Schroeder realized that there was no single reason why she should not deal with the idea of a re-candidate herself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me with a laugh 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates in the game, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Some called it “The Snowman and the Seven Dwarfs.”
Since the campaign had already been launched a long time ago, it was behind with funding, so she promised not to get into the game if she didn’t get <0x24>2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave her <0x24>1,000, would only give her <0x24>250.
“Do you think I’m bad?” she wondered.
During her speech that she did not start the official campaign, she was overcome by so much emotion – gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration from the system that made it so hard to make money and focus on the voters, rather than on the party.
“You could have thought I had a nervous breakdown,” Mrs. Schroeder recalled the reaction of the press.
“You could have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what I was going to write for my funeral.
“What did she cry?”
How the U.S.-China Trade War Can Be Good for Beijing
The opening ointments of the U.S.-China trade war were embarrassing and while the battle is not even far from over, the conflict between the countries can be a long-term benefit to Beijing, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week took place with new tariffs affecting items worth <0x24>200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively accounting for half of all goods coming to the US from China.
Beijing has paid off in the same way each time, with tariffs of five to ten percent coming in lately for <0x24>60 billion worth of goods.
China has pledged to deal with the US tactics, and the world’s second largest economy is unlikely to step down.
Achieving Washington’s resignation would mean complying with demands, but for Chinese President Xi Jinping, public honor would be even more painful.
However, experts argue that if Beijing plays its game well, the pressures of the U.S. trade war could in the long run positively support China by reducing the interdependence of both economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that trigger economic confusion in one of the countries is actually much more dangerous than we’ve seen before,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher at the University of Washington, who is a senior researcher.
Syria is ‘ready’ to return refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in restoring a country devastated by more than a seven-year war.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moual said in an interview with the United Nations General Assembly that conditions in the country are improving.
“Today, the situation is more stable and safer here, thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government is continuing to restore areas destroyed by terrorists to restore the normal state.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to a country that they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that were aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
A further six million people who still live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he did not accept conditional aid or aid from the countries that sponsored the uprising.
Europe Confirms Winning Ryder Cup Tournament in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on the Le Golf National near Paris in France.
The U.S. has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who failed in most tournaments, fired his first shot in the water at the 16th hole with a pair of 3 and gave up his match in favor of Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari lighted up in all of his wheels and became one of four players who played 5-0-0 since the tournament began in 1979.
Jordan Spieth is the lowest-ranked player in the European team Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, according to 2 and 1 Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played in his last Ryder Cup tournament.
The Ryder Cup’s eight-time veteran, Spain’s Sergio García, became a record European tournament winner with a career score of 25.5 points.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t help it today.
It was a tough year.
Thank you Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I’m very happy that the cup is coming back.
It’s about the team. I’m glad I was able to help,” Garcia said, influenced by the emotions after the European victory.
He handed over the staff to his countryman John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods with two holes at the remaining hole in the individual game on Sunday.
“I feel an incredible pride in defeating Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all four of his games in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A special statistic of one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles in second place behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled all weekend to find the right path except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk resigned after an unsatisfactory performance in front of his team, “I’m proud of these boys, they fought.
This morning, the time has come for Europe to lose sight of the situation.
We were fighting.
Sit down in front of Thomas.
He's an amazing captain.
All of his 12 players played very well.
We will re-create the group, work with the American Professional Golf Association and the Ryder Cup Tournament Committee and move forward.
I like these 12 guys and I'm proud to be a captain.
Downstairs.
You have defeated us.”
