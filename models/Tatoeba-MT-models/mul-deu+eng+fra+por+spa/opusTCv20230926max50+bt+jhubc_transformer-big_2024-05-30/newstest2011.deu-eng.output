The Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort nor the "Conditorei".
The new mayors of the capital from the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD ranks will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to understand their old new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the city representation at all.
The newspaper Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz has once "knocked" members of the new council from the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD a little bit, as they master the notorious serpent that has become a citizen in recent years, in which today's coalition partners in Prague were on the verge.
The coded vocabulary, introduced by the Prague political elite in the passing era of Mayor Pavel Bém, is borrowed from some of the most well-known actors, situations and causes.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new councils were tapping something in the dark with respect to these new terms.
At least they say so.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"I don't know."
"I'm rather a newcomer in Prague politics," Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD>, the new Councillor for Culture, responded to the test of the "Patent Vocabulary".
But also Mayor Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina - a political veteran - reacted in a similar way.
For example, the term "golf hole".
"This is the only expression of those you present to me here that I use over and over again."
“I don’t like snakes much.”
From the vocabulary published by Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz in June of this year before the ODS Election Congress, the editorial board picked out six terms, especially those notoriously associated with the Prague Magistrate.
The Social Democrats should define the terms "Voldemort", "Biggest Prague Golf Hole", "Go to the Confectionery", "Stiernacks", "Capital Treasure" and "Blood".
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, while the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of Prague school - promised his participation in the interview at first, but then did not even take the audience off.
The fifth chairman, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the front.
“I don’t care about these things and how the bourgeois democrats talk to each other, I don’t judge.”
“It’s important to me how we understand ourselves as part of our programs,” he said.
As already indicated, Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Kauk<0xC3><0xBD>k<0xC3><0xBD> in the above-mentioned headline allegedly did not recognize that the speech was made by the influential entrepreneur and friend of the former mayor Bém, Roman Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
The term "Voldemort" says nothing at all, and the only term he correctly learned during the test was "Prague's largest golf hole".
"This is the Blanka Tunnel," Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> said, adding to the security: "But I know that from the newspaper."
And jokingly, "I guess I'll have to take a language course."
The "golfloch" is deciphered not only by Matador Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, but also by the Environmental Advisor Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD> as the Blanka Tunnel.
But both Social Democrats also know who the term Voldemort stands for, and Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD> even knows where to find this figure and thus also what it means to "go to the confectionery".
“I think that means going to some Prague gastronomy business,” Plach<0xC3><0xBD> is pretty close to the puzzle solution, knowing that this is the headquarters of Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek’s companies.
In accordance with B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, however, he professes to have created this knowledge from the newspaper rather than to have this vocabulary of his own.
According to the test participants, there does not seem to be a similar domesticated snake among the Social Democrats.
“I’ve asked my colleagues, too, but obviously there’s nothing like that about us.”
"We call ourselves by name, we also use nicknames or nicknames again and again," says the president of the Prague <0xC4><0x8C>SSD Petr Hulínsk<0xC3><0xBD> - named by his party counterparts Salopp "Hulda".
"In school I was called B<0xC5><0x99>íza, but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina tells us his nickname.
The newspaper Deník Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz has tried the name and see da - it works.
Ratsherr Weinert is friendly to the party colleagues of the "Opa" or less friendly to the "Old", the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to himself before the elections through party sponsorship by some colleagues "Igrá<0xC4><0x8D>ek" (known Czech lego-figure)
Surnames are thus the only thing that allows the Social Democrats to use their language internally.
Hulínsk<0xC3><0xBD> allegedly does not like being called "Hulda", but Deník Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz registered another nickname of the Prague president.
His nickname "Doctor of Rubber Knife Rights" is allegedly related to Petr Hulínsk<0xC3><0xBD> acquiring his title of Doctor of Law at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "Hexen" and publishes a brochure
Women who are labeled witches in Burkina Faso usually have some common social traits.
They belong rather to the older generation, they find no work - for health reasons, for example, they are unemployed and have no children.
When one of these women becomes a witch, she is strictly isolated so that she cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
“Men are very rarely affected by this fate.”
“Young and healthy women will also be spared this because they help with work and give birth to children,” a religious sister describes the situation in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso in a special home for more than one hundred women who have been expelled from their communities.
The local government has now decided to take action against this abnormal "social measure".
And for this reason, he published a brochure to stop the "hexen chase".
But the thing has a hook.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," the newspaper "derStandard" pointed to the dilemma of written enlightenment.
However, witchcraft is also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighbouring Burkina Faso, 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured to death by three women and two men – they spilled oil and simply ignited it.
The incident was reported by the BBC server, among others.
The perpetrators, however, claimed that the matter would only have been a meeting of unfortunate circumstances.
According to your version, oil is inflamed, which is used for ritual ointments.
After the group tried to "expulse an evil spirit" from the woman.
The isolation of "hexen" supports people here regardless of their education.
“The Standard” quoted a 42-year-old Burkina Faso businessman as saying, “Freshers of human souls are a danger before and today,” he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to deter witch hunting, the Gambian president has decently mixed up the president himself last year.
"President Yahya Jammeh unleashed a monstrous witch hunt after his aunt's death, as these allegedly had a share in their deaths and would now try to kill the president himself through black magic."
"To this end, he called on Shamanes from nearby Guinea to help, who, accompanied by police, soldiers and the president's bodyguard, violently abducted women and men from Gambian villages and brought them to the president's farm in Kanilai," Amnesty International said in a statement.
On the farm, the incubated people were forced to drink a dish from plants with hallucinogenic effects, which also caused problems in the intestines and kidneys.
Two of the arrested people did not survive the stay on the farm.
It was only because of international pressure that nearly a thousand prisoners were released again.
A tenant from Bakala: He warms in the oven - still pays higher rent
An elderly underage man is leaving the RPG Byty customer center of the "coal baron" Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Bakala, the largest private owner of rented apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm a folder with three new lease agreements to three apartments: for his own and the apartments of his daughters and his son, who is currently serving a prison sentence.
All three have been increased in the context of the so-called "deregulation".
Instead of 3500 kroner monthly rent, the son is expected to rent a 2-room apartment with a second category kitchen for 4100 kroner next year.
"And there is not even flowing hot water in the apartment and you have to heat in a simple coal oven," he pointed with his finger at the son's new lease, to which he has power to sign.
"But what - I signed it," he explained half-stimulating and half-resigning.
BytyOKD.cz, which described the new rental terms as "incorrect and immoral", advises tenants not to sign the new contracts and to wait until December 7th, when it intends to publish a guide on how to proceed against such contracts.
But the man just turns away.
"One says this, the other says that," he makes a dark face.
The region of Ostrava becomes the largest "deregulation laboratory".
After the new year, this deregulation is ahead of most rented apartments in the Czech Republic, whose tenants have so far not paid market-friendly rents.
Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz therefore decided to visit this "Labor" in person.
The RPG Ward room in Haví<0xC5><0x99>ov is one of four in the Ostrava region and is already full at nine o’clock this Tuesday morning.
Right next to the door are the bodyguards of a security agency and a caller.
"Lease 2011", so a special keyboard on the touchscreen is illuminated.
Briefly tipped and the device already spucks out a number bar.
We barely deciphered the number "157" and already pieps it on the big screen on the ceiling of the waiting room.
Half a second later, you're in line.
A little later, an older couple enters the waiting room to ask for the rental, but the storm in the waiting room does not apply to the new rental at all.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair contracts, insurance issues and the like.
From mid-November in the region of Ostrava, the new lease agreements will flatten the majority of the 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio into the mailboxes.
The RPG Byty proposes a lease increase of about 15 to 38 percent in the letters.
The special switch for new rentals in the customer centre has been open since November 18.
“The action runs a little over a week, that is, it’s only the beginning,” the ladies behind the switch respond after a moment of hesitation when the “client” unfolds as a journalist.
The deregulation and Bakala’s former miners’ apartments are a brisk topic.
Before the elections, the parliamentary vice-president of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, Lubomír Zaorálek, from Ostrava, had quite a loud approach to this issue, no wonder that today the newspapers are full of it.
"Twenty years I want a new floor from them."
"Not even besch. They were able to replace toilet glasses," the man mentioned at the beginning makes himself airy.
So far, according to the employees, pensioners are mainly on the switch to make sure they really get the promised rental discount that promises them RPG if they sign the special offer in time.
The other tenants who will sign the new lease agreement until December 15th will also benefit from a half-reduction in February.
So far, however, "deregulation switches" in Haví<0xC5><0x99>ov are all but overloaded by demand.
"Of yesterday's 360 customers, only about 40 to 50 were rented here in 2011," the switch officials estimate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on both their websites as well as wall panels where it appears necessary.
However, if the leasing parties do not agree on the new lease, it will be decided by an independent court.
"This is not to be a threat, but to be understood as information about the only possible and fully legitimate legal procedure," RPG said on its website.
“Nobody is going to court here,” says one of RPG Byty’s employees and a man on the street in front of the client center, at least partly correct.
"I have 13,000 (krones) pensions, of which I have 5,000 left for food, where should I take the money for a court dispute," he says.
Then the employee will be insecure.
"Let's see."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them about the media that they should not sign and that's how people wait," she said.
Regulated rent ends in most of the Czech Republic by the New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty, the increase in rent is an economic necessity.
"The existing amount of rent is not even enough for the maintenance of the housing fund," argues Pavel Klime<0xC5><0xA1>, the director of the housing portfolio of the company RPG Byty and - precisely the neglect of the housing fund criticized by the tenants.
While RPG was able to invest <0x24>4 billion in housing in the years between 2005 and 2010, it is estimated to be <0x24>5.2 billion in the four years from 2011 to 2014.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling opposite to the cushion chairs in the Haví<0xC5><0x99>ov waiting room, some red lighting information appears in between.
"The rental increases in 2011 by 15% and less affect 31,200 apartments, that is more than 90% of RPG apartments."
"Always this means a maximum of 7.50 CZK per square meter and month," reads the LCD monitor.
Only with 400 apartments from the RPG portfolio, rent increases by 38 percent.
"In these cases it is about the increase in extremely low rental prices of 19.66 CZK per square meter," RPG argues.
For 2,600 apartments, the rent will remain the same in the next year.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation does not jump to the height of the rent, but gradually takes place within four to eight years.
What’s more, the company imposes a further obligation: All revenue from the rental increase (see chart) the company wants to put back into the apartments, especially in thermal savings – in new windows and in thermal insulation.
But - in particular, they are intended to benefit those who sign the agreements on the increase in rent.
The architects noticed - the office also includes a kindergarten
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini-garden here, with everything that belongs to it: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini-playground on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten has been available to Arch.Design staff since last year.
The design and architecture office Arch.Design, from whose studios a number of renowned Brno buildings originate, calculated from the first designs for the new Avriopoint building to include the premises for its company’s mining garden.
Wisely anticipated, because most of its 90 employees (inside) are in the babyboom age and the company is located to get the project antennas and architects back to their workplace as soon as possible.
Along with the ability to work shortened, the kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer its employees in the concept of its social program.
Construction engineers and architects are so much easier to put their sophisticated profession and childcare under a hat.
The mini-kindergarten is an original idea of the Arch.Design staff and with the support of management, they managed to win funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The operating mini-kindergarten is financed by the Human Resources and Employment Policy Operational Programme from the European Social Fund and from the Czech Republic's state budget.
Thanks to this funding (subsidy amounting to CZK 2.8 million), the necessary facilities and equipment could be purchased and for the duration of 2 years is provided for qualified personnel and for the operation.
After the funding has been exhausted (2 years), the Arch.Design company is obliged to continue operating the mini-kindergarten for another 3 years at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took a whole year, with the company providing effective assistance in the processing of the application.
Around the children take care of full-time qualified staff - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, children can visit the kindergarten without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is a mini kindergarten, only 5 children are allowed to be present at the same time, but the day varies over several children.
The kindergarten is adapted flexibly to the needs of the parents, the children of all employees have the same rights with regard to the use of the kindergarten - regardless of the company hierarchy and their respective position.
Although it is an individual education and care, the program content in the mini kindergarten is still comparable to the framework programme of preschool education.
Not only do children play here, they are offered excellent lessons - from basic knowledge to preschool lessons, they also learn English.
The classroom is not only equipped with toys and creative games, but also equipped with a computer that is available to the children.
What's more - the presence of young children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive corporate environment.
Parents can look at the children at any time and thus eliminate the stress of late picking up the children from a far-off kindergarten.
Parents use their working hours more productively.
It is no wonder that there are also natural and loyal employer-employee relationships.
Arch.Design was thus among the Czech companies that offer significant benefits in recruiting new employees, which are family-friendly and strengthen their staff marketing through such programs.
A bone house fascinates even after 100 years. Check out Gaudi’s interiors
The roof mutes like the back of a prehistoric oak, the stairs like the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are broken fish columns.
This is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From the local inhabitants, the house with its organic forms was nicknamed "Knochenhaus".
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile splitters and mosaics, the facades reminiscent of shelves and ubiquitous soft lines, all these are typical features of Antonio Gaudi’s youth style.
The facade of the house plays with dreamy lines, gentle colors and textures that resemble nature and living things.
It is only with a closer look that you notice that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful order.
At night, the entire facade looks even more plastic, more dramatic and the special lighting enhances the brightness of the colors.
The same swinging lines and enclosed shapes also dominate the interior of the house.
Shaft-shaped wood copies the window frames, shelves, decorative elements of doors, and even locking holes and railings.
The house Batlló in the Eixample district on the bustling shopping street Passeig de Gràcia No. 43 was created by the renovation of a house from 1877, carried out by the architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, originally consisted of the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but ultimately agreed to Gaudí’s idea of an unusual and even cheaper reconstruction.
However, the rental house Casa Batlló was not designed by Antoni Gaudí alone.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
It was on its zipper that the decorations were created for the representative apartment of the real estate owner and also the use of mosaics on the façade was his idea.
However, many other painters and artists also worked on the design of the façade.
The joint work on the designs for the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol also took part in the construction of Gaudí’s Casa Milá in the Park Güell, which also houses other works by Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after its completion, the house was given by the local inhabitants of its organic forms due to the nickname "Knochenhaus".
Others, in turn, called it the special window opening mechanism because of the "apparent house".
It is also said that the sword of St. George, patron of Catalonia, is depicted at the top of the building.
But other sculptural elements also symbolize hidden religious motifs.
Gaudí designed for the house a unique central heating system for the time with ventilation ducts and typical fireplaces.
It's a strange thing about her 45-degree inclination.
In his creation, Gaudí consistently ignored all the construction regulations of the time and did not allow himself to be confused by them.
Prior to the construction, he obtained the corresponding building permit from the city, but the information he had made about the planned reconstruction was so vague that the city fathers were so dismayed with the result that they demanded repairs two years later.
The councillors also insisted that the construction, with its pillars, even intervened on the public road.
However, there were no changes, quite the opposite - only fifteen days after the request of the district in this regard, Josep Batlló submitted an application for the approval of the rental of the two highest floors of the house - and it was promptly granted to him.
The house owner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the 2nd floor was a company hall, on the 3rd floor were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was sold to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey building runs through a staircase up to the rooftop terrace.
The basic elements of the reconstruction have removed all right angles and straight lines and replaced them with curved and curved walls.
But Gaudí also worked on a modern concept for the mutual connection of spaces.
The social part can be fully connected by opening the salon doors, so that a larger society can be conveniently plagiarized without having to give up a certain intimacy in more confidential conversations.
The house also received a rather unusual roof and two other floors through Gaudí’s remodeling, in addition to a new façade.
Also impressive is Gaudí’s play with the light as well as the blue and white glazed tiles with which the courtyard is covered and the lighthouses.
The game of these two colors gives a maximum of light to all floors of the house.
In doing so, he simply used the principle that white reflects light better than dark colors that absorb sunlight on the contrary.
The Casa Batlló House, which was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2005, can be visited by anyone today.
On the first floor, the most spacious and magnificent apartment is made accessible to the public.
The owners of the house decided to take this step only in the year, on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous creator.
When it was found that this was a fairly tolerant business, the visits were kept in place, yes, they were extended to other common areas and the attic spaces, including the roof terrace.
However, the price for visiting the monument is not a cardboard style, it is 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist cards will get a 20% discount.
This amount exceeds the entrance fees to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to get to know the true atmosphere of the house with its dragon tower, you should try to make friends with one of the homeowners and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bedding? Women have different desires than men
Not the best bed frames, but the quality of the bed surface - so mattresses and rust make up the good bed.
However, these must complement themselves harmoniously in order to meet the wishes of the specific user.
When choosing, many things play a role - the weight, the size, the health condition and, last but not least, the sex of the sleeper.
Equally important is the interior, in which mattress and rust have to be subordinated.
A typical example?
In a weekend home where it is not heated regularly, latex mattresses are not well suited, as they need much longer to "get warm".
In addition, they are much heavier than regular polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be turned on a regular basis.
If they do not have enough ventilation ducts in the core and are still lying on a solid plate, moisture persists: it is therefore not excluded that under the mold it forms.
Of course, choices also play a role in what you are used to.
Those who have been abroad for a long time, where very high mattresses with soft layer are common, will find it difficult to get used to a low mattress with a hard surface.
"Although all the ice hockey players who have come back from the NHL have complained to me that they can't sleep right here."
"For their coated shoulders, heels and hips, they just need a soft layer of Visco foam (Memory Foam - a form memory polymer)."
"I also recommend this to people with diabetes who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system so that they can receive the 'information' from the joints and skin poorly," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in mattress furniture.
That’s why I’ve been worried about many ice hockey players years ago, as well as other customers with these mattresses with Visco Foam (Memory Foam).
"Today this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses are offered, among other things, by the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And you don’t necessarily have to be a famous ice hockey player to learn to appreciate the benefits of the Visco foam.
This “Wonder” actually works quite simply.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, in other words, it molds itself right on the warm body.
Nowhere is it pressed, at night you don’t roll around like after a heavy fight.
You just sleep a lot better.
The viscoelastic foam also offers protection against decubitus (wundbrand).
When choosing the size of the mattress, you should still add the length of the foot soles to the body size, i.e. about 21 to 34 cm.
Men and women, who are 180 cm tall, need a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each sleeper should have at least 90 cm of bed width, i.e. 180 cm together.
For single beds, for example singles, 120 to 140 cm are suitable.
The comfort half and also for any visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule applies to the ideal bed width: "If you lie on your back, there should still be enough room for the slightly angled arms", advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, the midwife of the mattresses and roommates, who has been facing the problem of the healthy bed and the möchnol of the erökohl for years.
With a double bed, everyone needs their own rust and their own mattresses, but be careful when shopping so that the mattresses are equally high.
Otherwise, nothing remains but to mount the rust at different heights and this is not possible for every bed frame for a long time.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with spring skeleton 15 cm, of which should be at least three centimeters on the mold layer and the fine pad.
"You must not feel the feathers with your hand or when laying down," Helena Prokopová warns.
Each mattress requires a special type of rust.
Fully padded beds with mattress and substrate such as mature siamese twins have nothing to look for in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot be ventilated and you cannot wash the cover, which is already there today.
And since you lose between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat in a single night, it is clear that after five to seven years, the mattress slowly becomes a huge (and constipated) screen.
This is also why professionals reject advertising slogans that promise a lifespan of up to 25 years or even a lifetime warranty for mattresses.
Every thing has its when and but.
And for this reason, a practical advice from the merchants: for mattresses of 120 or 140 cm wide, you should not be afraid of the hygiene of washable, detachable covers, yet it is recommended to use a mattress saver that can be easily removed and washed.
Although mattress covers are usually made today with round zipper, so that after opening you get two halves (important for the washing process and the washing machine size!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially on its own, is often performed like the uneven fight between David and Goath.
Do they have a fixed plate in bed instead of a rust?
Get the lady out!
Or at most for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
Also, they should prefer to provide the plate with ventilation holes (if they are not already inside) and use mattresses with spring skeleton and a minimum height of 15 cm with so-called pocket spring cores and fine pads.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong to such a substrate.
Latex or sandwich mattresses are suitable for non-adjustable latex mattresses with 14 to 18 spring strips (latex or sandwich mattresses) (if applicable, also combinations of latex and coconut), with a larger number of latex mattresses, i.e. 28 or more spring strips, with the possibility of adjusting the Lord's supports in the latex wire.
Adjustable laminate skeleton mattresses do not include spring skeleton mattresses, as they do not respond to the ergonomic setting.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the spring strips, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This involves a special fastening of the spring bars, which allows the spring bars to be pressed or even angled in such a way that they allow for the punctuation of the shoulders of the sleeper.
Especially for men with wide shoulders is an important thing.
There are even mattresses manufacturers who have started using soft zones for the shoulder area in "men's mattresses".
The ladies are also thought of - they are given these soft zones in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers, point elastic wing spring systems (Lattoflex) or rust with point elastic contact pads with so-called multi-torsion suspension are designed.
The pressure is distributed at several points, which reduces the voltage.
But - if you use a bad (too large and full) head cushion for the right mattress and the right rust, most of the benefits are lost again.
Also here is a rule of thumb: the pillow should support the head, its tip should only reach to the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Ideally, therefore, a 50 x 60 cm pillow looks like, for example, the Scandinavian.
In the side position, the head pillow (together with the shoulder relief zone in the rust or the soft zone in the mattress) should equal the shoulder height.
Our modern mattresses have something in common with the former (filled with yeast) straw bags.
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least their incorporations.
Also with mattresses, the new magic word is "Bio".
Instead of petroleum raw materials, more and more natural oils are used to make polyurethane foams – for example, ricin and soya oil.
Soja is probably used by all known manufacturers.
"Bio means that the core of mattresses is made of purely natural materials," explains Petr Va<0xC5><0xA1>í<0xC4><0x8D>ek of Tropico Plus.
But natural materials are also used in the manufacture of mattress coatings - one of the first was Aloe Vera.
You can also use microcapsules that spread fresh forest or lavender fragrances while you sleep.
There is also a difference between a man and a woman.
While a "cooler" plant extract from cherry leaves is used in men so that the mattress cover can absorb the heat and cool the body, the covers for women have a "heating" effect.
Extracts from red peppermints stimulate blood circulation, which means that the weaker sex becomes warm during sleep.
What about today’s favorites?
Cold foam mattresses (it has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than commercial polyurethane and also much more flexible).
The combination of the different stiffness (hardness) of cold foams and visco foams creates multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, hips and heels are located.
For a high-quality mattress, however, you have 7,000 crowns and more to rub.
However, health mattresses are usually charged with lower VAT, as they are considered medical aids.
As the first Czech company, Gumotex was given this advantage.
You can see that saving on the mattress and on the rust is not so easy.
From time to time there are special offers from manufacturers and dealers that offer two mattresses at the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers the Duofreeze mattress with concealed Visco Foam Memory for CZK 11,990.
The second one is available for free.
It was the Tempur material that initiated the era of viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density at almost cosmic speed.
No wonder, they were designed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to huge overloads during the launches.
Tempur becomes soft when it is warm, in a cool environment it again solidifies.
In this way, it perfectly adapts to the human body and optimally distributes the body pressure.
Therefore, it is not only ideal for preventing pressure burns, but generally increases sleep comfort.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses, but also for other health products, such as special foot pads to provide relief to the legs and vessels.
For example, local manufacturers use the foams Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human surveillance devices to keep the kids under control
The fear of their own children is growing and so more and more parents are considering monitoring them via GPS.
The system, which was originally invented for driving cars, can be just as good for people, which would be helpful even in such cases, as recently with the untraceable disappearance of nine-year-old Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka Janatková.
The device is currently about as big as a cigarette box, but soon it is not supposed to be larger than a wristwatch.
Many people have moved the case of the missing Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka into fear and horror, so they keep looking for means and ways to better protect their children.
Also for the price of a violation of their privacy.
“We’re trying to tell everyone that it’s not about spying, but an effective means of reducing the likelihood of tragedy,” said Petr Pilin of the company Macro Weil, one of the providers of GPS tracking devices on the site.
“I admit that in individual cases, such devices may be abused, for example, if you put them in someone’s pocket without them knowing, but we haven’t had such a case to record so far.”
“Most customers actually buy it for security reasons,” adds Pilin.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know for what purpose the "box" serves and how to use it in an emergency.
However, children’s psychologist Dana Bo<0xC4><0x8D>ková points out that a child, if he does not like to wear such a thing, is simply getting rid of it.
“Even very young children show great creativity when it comes to losing certain things intentionally if they don’t want to be controlled.”
"Even the phones at first aroused high expectations from parents, but they can be switched off just as easily as these new monitoring devices," says Ms. Bo<0xC4><0x8D>ková.
In your opinion, it is also disputed whether such a facility actually helps in the event of an attack.
“In the case of planned kidnappings, the kidnapper almost always checks whether the child has any electronics with which to locate it.”
“Today it’s the phone.”
“If such monitoring devices were to find widespread use, they would also be looking for these as their sales would be securely accompanied by massive advertising.”
"In these cases, the criminals of the police are always one step ahead," the psychologist says.
However, she admits that similar devices can be quite helpful in a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to Roberta <0xC4><0x8C>ech of the company RC Monitoring, which offers location services for both cars and people, the existence of such a device can help even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be adjusted in such a way that it reports the respective position at certain intervals."
"Even if it were destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the person concerned is available."
"For more expensive devices, even a slope meter is integrated, that is, if you fall down and lie motionless, the device immediately sends a warning indicating the position," says Mr. <0xC4><0x8C>ech.
In his opinion, similar services could also perform smart mobile phones with navigation, you just need to record a special software.
The problem with the current location devices is that these are either wooden box-sized devices that resemble trailers or smaller phones.
There is always the risk of losing them.
According to Mr. Pilin from the Macro Weil, therefore, devices that look like normal digital watches are being tested in the present.
"This has the advantage that the potential attacker does not have to realize at all that it is a monitoring or locating device.
"Or he only notices it after a certain time, which gives the police a time leap," he adds.
Regardless of the direction of development - to bracelets or trailers, the same technology is always used as in vehicle repair.
So the combination of location function using the GPS system (as with the navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many ignition cords that you could wrap the whole Czech Republic but only hold you for two years
The Czech Army has purchased 445 kilometres of ignition cords, being lit with explosives.
In the previous year, the Ministry of Defence had already delivered 224 kilometres of ignition rope to the army camps.
It is reassuring to know that the armed forces have taken care of for 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the ignition cords - two, but not more than four years.
The army bought the ignition cord from the stock company STV Group, a.k.a. for <0xC2><0xA3>40 million.
In his justification for the purchase of this huge amount of ignition cord, the General Staff of MF DNES replied that the soldiers would consume the 60 kilometres of ignition cord annually.
According to the research of army pyrotechnicians, which the MF DNES claimed, it follows from this statement that the entire army would have to undergo an extremely intensive pyrotechnic training annually - from all the generals and officers of the army command, to the secretaries and putz.
Defence Minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek are not excluded.
Only in this way could the significant annual consumption of sixty kilometres of ignition scrap be half justified.
This is equivalent to 25,000 detonations.
But even so, these remnants of arms would be enough for more than a decade.
However, if the old rule of experts still applies that two meters of cord of fire are completely sufficient to train each new professional soldier, then through these new purchases - even in view of the increased need of the pioneer and special units - the army has created a sedative stockpile for the 22 years.
Soldiers of the Rapid Defence Brigade recently complained to Defence Minister Vondra that they had almost no more cartridges for handguns, so shooting exercises are severely limited due to the lack of funds.
Not to mention the lack of underpants.
"I also don't understand why they buy so many ignition cords from us."
But in the end, that’s their decision, they’ll already know what they need.”
“For us, the army is a good customer, to whom we, as a dealer, want to meet,” says Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD>, sales manager of the STV Group.
Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, founded the purchase of a hundred kilometres of fire rope with the army covering itself with this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD> of the STV Group speaks only of a four-year service life of the ignition cords and police and army pyrotechnicians of only two years.
"With perfect storage, the four years mentioned are also possible," admits one of them, but wants to remain anonymous, in order not to be regarded as a soldier of the criticism of the army.
After the expiration of the service life, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested to see if it is still reliable and does not endanger the lives of the soldiers.
These tests, however, are not for nothing, but cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defence is the quantity discount for the 445 kilometres of ignition rope.
"They cost us sixty percent less than last year's 244-kilometre delivery," spokesman Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek said in a statement.
For comparison only: the annual consumption of firearms by police pyrotechnicians liquidating ammunition from World War II or the Soviet Brotherhood has not exceeded 1,500 meters for a few years.
And the police are always ordering only amounts of this ammunition that they can consume before the expiration of the service life.
Due to the safety of the pyrotechnicians, the possibility of flexible purchases is also kept open for more modern and thus reliable ignition cords.
The Ministry of Defence has had enormous problems with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Treaty when the two hundred thousand-headed Czechoslovak People’s Army prepared for their campaign to the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians who claimed MF DNES, the Czech army expects in a few years the same problem in the liquidation of hundreds of kilometres of old ignition cords, which it has bought so "favourably" today.
To date, I have found the contacts that I have won thanks to the competition.
The successful placement in the "Small Entrepreneurs of the Year" competition helped Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun sell his hotel franchise.
The winner of last year's competition "Small Entrepreneur of the Year" was Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun from Liberec.
The story of his success mutters like a film scenario.
Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun likes to travel.
It was only abroad that he became aware that there was a lack of good accommodation at reasonable prices in Liberec.
From the savings of his holiday work abroad and with the help of a bank loan he built a cobblestone house with five apartments.
Considering that he was a college student at the time in the sixth semester, this was certainly a courageous undertaking.
“The price-quality ratio at the time annoyed me and so I tried to do something about it,” says Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun.
The first renovated apartment was rented to foreign workers.
He immediately reinvested all of his profits in the house, which he then renovated step by step to retirement with 54 beds.
Since then, in just seven years of entrepreneurial activity in Liberec, he has managed to open four pensions, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds in all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel".
This year, another first-class hotel was added.
“We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, to which we have sold our franchise concept, and other interested parties in the Pytloun hotel franchise have already signed up,” says last year’s number one businessman.
"A large share of this sale of licenses to operate hotels was just the victory in the "Entrepreneur of the Year" competition," Mr. Pytloun adds recognizingly.
The victory brought him greater familiarity, yes, popularity in Liberec and its surroundings.
“People recognized me on the street, often congratulated me even afterwards and I have to say it did really well,” he recalls.
I really recommend anyone who wants to create something to participate in this competition.
You also don’t have to win right away, every visibility is good.
He says that he has benefited so far from the contacts and acquaintances he would not otherwise have come to.
“With some people I’ve met thanks to the competition, I still have regular business relationships to this day.”
In his opinion, the fame associated with success is also a bit of a concern for each of his employees.
And then he's in his 70s.
"I note with them greater loyalty and pride that they are part of something that will be universally recognized."
I don’t really see this as just a personal success, no, that’s the result of the good work of all of us.”
"My name is only slightly pushed into the foreground," says Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun modestly.
I wish my followers a quieter year than we had in Farmet
Victory euphoria was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his ambition, Farmet has the worst behind it.
Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>, the owner of Farmet, received the prize for the first rank of the Vodafone Competition of the year last year.
At the time, the jury honored the efforts he made to get a company out of the ground from the small tool factory in <0xC4><0x8C>eská Skalice, which makes hundreds of millions of sales.
“I can say that this appreciation has encouraged not only me but all of my employees and strengthened our self-confidence in the fight against the competition,” the winner said.
At the beginning of Farmet’s company history was the effort to do something useful.
And then when the state offered to his father Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>, in compensation for the property seized by the Communists, a small workshop for rent, he did not hesitate for a long time, leaving his career in the company in which he was employed until then, and founded with some comrades of his own company a company of his own.
Shortly afterwards, they began to focus on vegetable oil presses.
Within 18 years, they have become the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in all of Central Europe.
But it was only through the success of the above competition and its medialization that it also entered into the awareness of the non-specialist public.
“Not only did our customers now realize the Farmet brand significantly more intensively, but also our foreign partners began to be able to collaborate with a company that has achieved the greatest possible success in their country,” says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
Last year, however, Farmet was not just a sign of victory.
The assessment was based on the company’s economic results in 2008 and part of 2009.
And just 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tool construction products.
The crisis, which at the time shocked the citizens even less, but above all, reached its peak - many companies were forced to stop their investment projects and restrict the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
“Of course, we couldn’t escape this situation either.”
“Revenues dropped by 40 percent, we had to restrict production and even resort to dismissals,” says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
A viable company must sometimes take such unpopular measures as well.
However, it managed to cope with the situation and keep the company in the black numbers, even with lower profits than before the crisis.
In one, the company was not willing to make scraps - in the case of investments in research and development.
“From the grant we built a research and training center, we strengthened our presentation at international fairs and won major awards at domestic exhibitions,” says <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
Everything shows that we have overcome the crisis.
Revenues are growing again and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a lot of joy at the victory - but in a quieter atmosphere," says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
An opinion poll that cleans up with nonsense rules
The opinion poll on the "absurdity of the year" is part of the entrepreneurial competition for the fourth time.
Some nonsense rules have already managed to be created out of the world.
The dubious winner of the next year’s poll “Absurdity of the Year” advanced the obligation to create documents on authorities that are available online.
Thus, more than a third of not all four thousand voting entrepreneurs decided.
Thus, the Social Security Administration demanded a piece of paper from the trade register, even if the official had been able to retrieve it by two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the opinion poll, this is changing now.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer demand withdrawals from the trade register in the future when it comes to checks by social security payers," <0xC4><0x8C>SSZ spokeswoman Jana Bura<0xC5><0x88>ová said.
The purpose and purpose of the opinion poll "Absurdity of the Year" is to take all the regulations and arrangements under the guise of fulfilling the entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and abolish the nonsense.
This is the fourth time this year that it is part of an entrepreneurial competition organised by the Czech Economic Newspaper (HN) and enjoys a growing popularity among the public.
If three thousand people took part in the vote last year, it was already four thousand this year.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations that only serve to obstruct business activities.
"As regards, for example, the number of income tax forms, we are taking a leading position in the world," said Karel Havlí<0xC4><0x8D>ek, from the association of small and medium-sized enterprises and business operators of the Czech Republic.
Simplifying entrepreneurship has been the goal of all governments in recent years.
However, compared to the world, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranks 74th in terms of company conditions, with a lower ranking of eight places compared to the previous year.
The Competition Absurdity of the Year was declared for the first time in the year and takes place every year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April until the end of the competition.
For registration, the website www.firmaoku.cz. Subsequently, the organiser of the competition seeks out seven candidates for the "Anti-Price" and allows the public to vote via the Internet on the websites www.firmaoku.cz/absurdita and www.hined.cz.
It beats the absurdity that gets the most votes.
More than a hundred, more precisely 105 meaningless regulations and arrangements have been reported for this year’s opinion poll.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated "finalists" of the competition, for example, there are provisions that maintenance vehicles have to pay for highways and highways or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets must perform every two years.
The list of this year's "Seven" is published on the page of the competition.
The announcement of the competition at Prague Wenceslas Square at the beginning of November is part of an event in which political and public figures regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the association of small and medium-sized enterprises and commercial operators of the Czech Republic, and Petr Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el, the president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, were at the height of the competition with the party.
"Where the state throws nods between the legs of entrepreneurs, there can be no real economic upheaval, so my goal is to remove at least thirty paragraphs every year that make it even more unnecessary for entrepreneurs to do their business today," said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry.
Efforts to create nonsense out of the world have an effect.
In 2007, people violated the obligation imposed on entrepreneurs to notify the commercial officer at the place of their permanent establishment three days in advance of their intention to drive with an exhibition stand or a showcase.
This obligation was repealed by virtue of a novelty of the Commercial Law.
The obligation, which received the second largest number of votes in 2007 - the obligation to report work trips of employees up to 30 days - was abolished by the so-called "Green Card" law on them.
And - all good things are three:
For the absurdity of 2009, the regulation was chosen, which required physiotherapists to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two person scales in the speech room.
This regulation was somewhat mitigated by the Ministry of Health this year - the refrigerator obligation went away.
A new category honors socially responsible companies
Assessment criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sporting projects
A new feature in this year’s fifth year of the competition of the Economic Newspaper (HN) is the category “Responsible Company of the Year 2010”.
The main idea of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair undertakings.
“We want to support companies that are aware of the impact of their entrepreneurial activities on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives,” says Patrik Bartholdy, the regional manager of Vodafon’s mobile radio company, the creator and guarantor of this year’s competition.
For this year’s first year of this special subcategory of the Vodafone Competition of the Year, companies for which success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is extremely inspiring and demands enough fabric for an independent article.
Although they differ diametrically in terms of the object of their activity, their efforts still have a common denominator - support and consideration.
For example, this is about people with disabilities, as it is about personal problems or the health of their employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which promotes the creation of non-formal sports teams among its employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company in the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main sponsor of a fund for disabled children for seventeen years.
A paper mill from Pod<0xC4><0x9B>brady, for example, takes care of its disabled workers, who make up 70 percent of its workforce, for which it was awarded the title "Responsible Company of the Middle Bohemia Region"; in the competition of this year's Vodafone company.
In the region of Olomouc, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft won, among other things, introducing a flowing and also reduced working time to an average of 35 hours per week, without a proportional reduction in wages.
The jury also honored the fact that the company mainly shops with Czech manufacturers, supports citizens’ initiatives in their surroundings and works according to environmentally friendly principles.
“We strive to recycle as much as possible to minimize the impact of our entrepreneurial activity and administration on the environment,” explains its Managing Director Milushe Ryznarová.
In turn, the responsible IT company Enlogit from the <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem region is located on the health of its employees, which is why it has provided them with ergonomic chairs and keyboards for all notebooks, and also promotes them in their employees’ homework, making them work at home, and making them work at a car company.
"In addition, we support the People in Need Foundation, which provides concrete assistance to the local Roma community," said Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Such<0xC3><0xBD>, the company's representative.
Last but not least, it is worth mentioning the activity of the cleaning company "Praní a <0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>ní" from the Karlsbad region, which contributes to their employees in the form of extra bonuses to their pension insurance.
"We are providing our employees with contributions to catering, to the workplace, to increase their qualifications and to the holidays," says Josef Strapá<0xC4><0x8D> of the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Mahrish-Schlesian region.
To the category Responsible Company of the Year, all district finalists of the Vodafone Company of the Year competition were automatically registered, which answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organizer by 15 August at the latest.
Wrong or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organiser.
"If the representatives of the competing firms left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the contest "Responsible Company of the Year", but in the main competition Vodafone Company of the Year they were not disqualified for that reason."
“Separate registration for this competition alone is not possible because it is just a subcategory of the main competition company of the year,” said Karel Goldman of the organising agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Police arrests at a public tender
In the building of the floor fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police have made arrests in recent days.
The local media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. was detained by the detectives in handcuffs.
It had allegedly attempted to manipulate a public competition currently taking place for the processing of reimbursement claims in such a way that the property offered in the competition belonged to a specific interested party.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. is said to have paid half a million for it.
"At this point, I can only confirm that the police are tracking a person for the crime of fraudulent conduct in a public competition," said Antonie Zelená, the head of the Pilsner prosecutor's office of the newspaper "Právo", she could not find further details regarding the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old businessman was again fired by the police.
The way in which he was able to manipulate public competition can only be speculated in the light of the scarce official information.
The spokeswoman for the Lubomír <0xC4><0x8C>erná Foundation pointed out to Pravo that the police actually carried out arrests at the Pilsner subsidiary of the ground fund during a public competition.
“It was a client and not one of our employees,” she said.
According to the public competition, Ms <0xC4><0x8C>erná had the correct designation "invitation to tender claims for the transfer of land in accordance with the Land Act" and would take place in cases where several applicants show interest in the proposed land.
"These persons offer, in the context of the call, a higher value of their claims to be compensated by the transfer than the declared value of the property."
"According to the claims offered, the order of the potential buyers is determined, then the land fund transfers the property to the person with the highest bid," the fund's spokeswoman explains.
Obviously, Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. was available for information on who had applied for the request and since he was himself the eligible person, since he had purchased a number of reimbursement claims, he offered a property interest that he would withdraw from the competition.
Obviously against a greasy cut.
That would also be a sufficient explanation for why he had such a large sum of money with him when he was arrested.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. had already had too good contacts with the Pilsner Bodenfonds in the past.
He also played a role in the case of the former head of the ground fund Václav Sankota, who was prosecuted criminally because he issued lands in the case of replacement restitutions, which had already been subject to location decisions on construction projects.
At that time, Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. from the ground fund also acquired land for the construction of public roads, more precisely, at the site where the construction of the access road was planned for the commercial area Borské pole.
Later, he exchanged it very favourably with the magistrate against a house directly in the historical center of the city, which far exceeded the value of the property.
At the time, the town hall had to bend heavy hearts so as not to endanger the construction project by blocking the plots.
Housing costs of households increase by a few hundred per month
From January, households will not only have to expect higher costs for all types of energy, but also higher water and sewage charges, and rentals will also grow for remote heating and in some places.
Families will have to withdraw hundreds of crowns a month from their wallet from January.
Electricity will be up to 4.6 percent more expensive, gas up to 2 percent and more, in some cities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supplies, and in some places remote heat supplies will also be disbursed.
Electricity control alone costs the households a few hundred kroner more per year.
Strong electricity prices have been lowered by all major suppliers, so it is due to the significant promotion of electricity generation from renewable sources, namely from photovoltaic plants.
Gas is only moderately more expensive, but this is precisely when people have to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
There are also a few hundred more kroner per year.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, prices for district heating vary from city to city.
Especially larger locations are planning price increases.
For example, households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové will have to pay up to 50 kroner more per month for remote heating from January, more than 1,000 kroner more per year for families in Liberec.
Prague’s residents, in turn, are threatened by 9% higher water and sewage charges, in the event that the city increases infrastructure leases.
If the lease does not change, it is only 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague remains one of the lowest compared to the whole of the Czech Republic.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sewage charges are expected to rise by 7.4 percent.
Huge increases in rental prices can be expected, for example, in 140,000 rental apartments, where from January the so-called rental regulation will disappear.
For example, the housing company CPI Byty, which owns 2,500 apartments in <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem, plans to increase rents by a hundred percent from January.
Anyone who does not agree with this increase in rent will be interested in the company.
Regulated rents, which are still being paid in approximately 300,000 apartments, are expected to rise by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children drown with fernet and rum beer is out - it just seems too slow
Fernet, rum and vodka, with the exception of a good whiskey that you stole from your father’s bar.
These are the drinks, according to which drunken Czech teens among fifteen need to be treated most often.
No exceptions are children who have to sleep in the hospital repeatedly.
This is evidenced by the experience of doctors who are confronted with similar cases in the admission of children’s departments of clinics.
“Beer or wine are completely out of fashion because it just takes too long to get drunk.”
"Today's trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Lud<0xC4><0x9B>k Pelikan, the head of the children's department at the Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice Clinic.
"Whisky, if it manages to turn the father a bottle out of the house bar, and if not, then at least remote or vodka.
"Wodka has the advantage that you can mix it with juice, then it doesn't smell so strongly," the chief doctor explains.
The spokeswoman of the Faculty Hospital Motol Eva Jurinová gives him the right.
"Most often it's about distance or rum."
"This is the current alcohol trend, especially in primary schools."
"It was also about Slibowitz, who was taken from home," Jurinová said.
According to Chief Medical Officer Pelikán, 13- or 14-year-old drinkers in the hospital are no exception for a long time.
Before the clinic in Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years in the pediatrics department of the Motol Hospital, where the ambulances delivered drunken students from near and far.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"She began her career at the age of 12 when she was first given 3.5 promille alcohol in the blood and still in combination with "extase", the doctor described a particularly severe case.
"She was on the exhibition ground in Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice at some dance party."
“The interesting thing was that it wasn’t strange to her mother that her daughter didn’t come home for 48 hours,” the chief doctor said.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or their incredible tolerance in stirring up their own sayings that is considered to be one of the main causes of the growing alcoholism of children.
According to experts, there is no true dependence on children in the true sense of the word.
“Alcoholism is a long-standing chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomena, and this is not the case in these children.”
For those who repeatedly enjoy alcohol, a negative family-social background is usually characteristic,” explains chief doctor Pelikan.
According to the spokeswoman of the hospital Motol, Ms. Jurinová, by mid-November about forty drunk children were sent to the local department of pediatric and adolescent medicine.
However, only the cases of severe alcohol poisoning that required a hospital stay are included in the statistics.
Drunk children brought home by their parents or, where appropriate, by the police after ambulatory treatment will not be registered.
In addition to the cases in which children drink only once a bottle of snacks in the school bench, in the opinion of Mr. Pelikán there are three seasonal amplitudes, on which there is a hundred percent reliance: Walpurgis Night, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either because of sadness for the bad testimony or because of joy on the holidays."
“In the Walpurgis night, I also experienced seven drunk children at once in the recording,” says Dr. Pelikán.
A drunken child who spends the night under medical supervision is paradoxically better off than a child who only struggles with an unpleasant cat the next day.
The headaches in the morning after that, resulting from dehydration and glucose deficiency, can be distributed in the hospital with a liquid-supporting infusion of glucose and nutrients that are missing from the body.
"They're clearly better at it, because after the 'glorious' experience in the evening, they wake up with good humor without hurting anywhere."
"They're just a little confused about where they are," admits Dr. Pelikán, at least by destabilizing the patient's good mood by listing them the cost of the treatment.
Because the transportation by the ambulance and the night in an emergency bed come well and like to a few zig thousand kroner.
“I used this as a means of education again and again when I paid directly to the children during the visit what their drunkenness cost and that it can happen that they have to work all the holidays to earn money for a single such party,” added Dr. Pelikan.
In his opinion, however, the hospitals do not resort to regression procedures to demand the costs necessary for the healing of drunken children from the parents.
Two training aircraft L-159 for the first time in foreign hands - in Spain
Two light combat aircraft L-159 out of a total of five, which the Czech Ministry of Defence has exchanged against the transport aircraft Casa C-295M, flew to the Spanish city of Seville on Tuesday, where Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is based.
This is the first time that machines of this type are in the possession of a foreign army.
To date, they were only seen in manoeuvres or flight shows abroad.
This is about the flying two-seat version L-159T1, which was operated by the Czech Army.
The other three aircraft are single-seat L-159.
These are currently preserved in Aero Vodochody, which the broker of this business - the company Omnipol - took over last week.
When she physically expedites the aircraft from Vodochody, Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, is not yet known.
The one-seat fighter aircraft L-159, in turn, was separated from long-term aircraft, without further deposits and investments by the Ministry’s department.
"The two-seat L-159T1 was exchanged in its current state and appearance," Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek told the newspaper Právo.
He added that the army would not have to go out without two-seat fighter jets, as the Ministry of Defense signed a 200-million deal with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 on the conversion of four superfluous L-159 to the two-seat version.
A new aircraft took over the army in July, the second wants to take over by the end of this year.
According to Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, EADS has committed to deploying the fighter jets into the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
“The contract clearly states that the company EADS is the buyer of the L-159 aircraft and that they are intended to serve as training pilots of NATO countries.
"It is therefore a matter of the customer, how he realizes the matter," Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
The Economic Newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government had no interest in the L-159.
The trade of five L-159s against a Casa transport aircraft and the purchase of additional aircraft for 3.5 billion kroner had been approved by the government of Mirek Topolánek last year.
At the time, the Ministry of Defence had not issued a tendering procedure for the purchase, but spoke directly to EADS.
The defence office at the time argued that this exchange would support the future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech Army purchased 72 machines, of which it only used 24, the rest it wanted to sell.
By the way, the purchase of the aircraft Casa is also likely to have a judicial succession.
The European Commission appealed to the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice, which is why it should have chosen the aircraft on the basis of a pan-European tender and not by a single manufacturer's response.
The army has already taken over three aircraft Casa, the latter is scheduled to land at Kbely Airport within fourteen days.
A longer finger than a ring finger means a lower risk of getting cancer.
Men whose index finger is longer than the ring finger are obviously at a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published Wednesday in the British Journal of Cancer.
This is supposed to be related to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
“Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, especially in men up to sixty,” said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should necessarily undergo a prostate cancer test, especially when there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health burdens, Eeles added.
Between 1994 and 2009, she and her colleagues tracked more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer in Britain, but also 3,000 healthy men at the same time.
In more than half of the study participants, the right finger was shorter than the ring finger.
These men had the same probability of prostate cancer as 19 percent of men whose ring and index fingers were equal in length.
However, in men whose index finger was longer than the ring finger, this risk decreased by 33 percent, and in men up to sixty even 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two mentioned fingers, which are already formed in prenatal age, obviously reflects the different levels of sex hormones to which the child was exposed in the womb.
Less testosterone is equivalent to a longer finger.
Previous research has revealed that just testosterone accelerates the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pa<0xC4><0x8D>es, a leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, said <0xC4><0x8C>TK knew this study volatilely, yet he did not consider the relationship between finger length and cancer risk to be “completely proven.”
Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 are closed
Just like most parts of Europe, the Czech Republic is under a snow cover on Thursday morning.
On the roads and pedestrians there is mostly stuck snow, the winter servants were on the axle many places all night long.
The highway D5 between kilometres 89 and 90 in the direction of Rozvadov is blocked by some truck and truck accidents, and the D1 at Brno is also "standing" in the direction of Prague.
This was said by Novinky.CZ of the dispatcher of the Central Auto-Moto Club (<0xC3><0x9A>AMK).
At kilometre 91, a truck was injured, at kilometre 93, two trucks collided, in this accident there were injured.
There are also a few trucks in the street graveyard.
There are also problems with kilometres 185 of the motorway D1 towards Prague.
Two trucks collided here too.
The drivers should leave immediately behind Brno at 190 kilometres or over Brno and take up at 182 kilometres at the village of K<0xC3><0xBD>valka.
In fact, there is a mile-long blockage.
There was also an accident on the D11, which happened on the way to Prague.
In Prague itself there is a several centimeters thick snow cover and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
Auto columns form, for example, in the district of Prosek, the road <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>rboholská is also completely blocked.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
The trams run with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Friedensplatz.
At eight o’clock in the morning, the Prague Crisis Staff meets.
There are also problems with the railway and at the airport.
The Czech State Railway had to cancel seven high-speed train connections due to snow rejections.
For example, there are problems on the route Prague - Kralupy or also Prague - Beroun.
Travellers should be aware of the current situation.
Airport Ruzyn<0xC4><0x9B> is closed from Wednesday 11 a.m. to 5 a.m.
Most roads in South Morris are only accessible with increased caution.
To Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kov, three side roads are completely inaccessible, in the vicinity of Brno snow barriers are sometimes formed, and in the vicinity of Blansko one is forced to use snow grinders on some higher roads.
One of the most affected areas is Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kov.
There are still three roads completely blocked: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Ku<0xC4><0x8D>erov and also <0xC5><0xA0>aratice - Mile<0xC5><0xA1>ovice.
You will also need to use snow cutters to clean the snow.
When they become transportable again, it is not possible to estimate until now.
In the Hodonín region, caution is exercised in the area of the White Carpathians.
There is a snow cover up to five centimeters thick on the roads, which are allowed to be scattered only with inert scattering agents for nature conservation reasons.
In the Czech Republic, snow fell from two to ten centimeters, most in northern Bohemia - at times up to 18 centimeters.
In the Mährisch-Schlesisch region, snow fell up to 15 centimeters.
In the Czech Republic, however, it stops snowing slowly.
American soldiers have a new “intelligent weapon.”
For the first time in Afghanistan, U.S. troops have deployed a new “intelligent” weapon, known only by its codename XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will affect the conflict there with the Taliban and shift the power ratio to their favor.
The new weapon is like a super accurate cannon.
In fact, their projectiles are directed to the target by laser with a hitting safety of just a few meters.
The special 25 mm caliber shots, designed for this rifle and containing highly explosive explosives, work practically like small grenades.
The shots can be programmed so that they can explode not only when hitting the target, but at any point of their ballistic flight.
That is, you can use them against an enemy who is hiding behind an obstacle - a wall or in the trench.
It is usually not protected from the top, so the murderous steel splitting rain from the top can easily put it out of the fight.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new combat rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "intelligent" technologies.
"The soldier basically proceeds like this: he vibrates the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, so he wins an exact point of view, after which he corrects the elevation angle, then he only needs to press down.
"Let's say you've measured 543 meters."
"When pressed, the gun loads up and shoots the gun at a distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs are being relocated
The Fujitsu Group moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their workplace from the previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the computer and its maintenance industry giant announced on Wednesday, in July next year 400 women and men will move their workplace from the previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park, a large office complex on the Lyoner Straße in the city of Frankfurt.
In the medium term, a spokeswoman for Fujitsu said, another 100 jobs should be placed in the group, which have been distributed to the region so far.
The rental offer has been extremely attractive, and the large offices in Astro Park are better suited to the way employees work.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was only a tenant.
Chief Executive Officer Bernd Wagner said, "With Frankfurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure."
The excellent connection to the airport is of great importance to a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of an important company within the region yesterday brought joy to the winners and disappointment to the losers.
Frankfurt's economic vice-president Markus Frank (CDU) said that a "global player" has been won once again.
That's a "great location knowledge."
Fujitsu fits the city, the settlement is an important impulse for low-wheel drive.
Bad Homburger Mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted Fujitsu’s decision.
The city was informed early by the management of the intention.
“Of course, we offered our help to the company,” Korwisi said.
However, the friendly contacts could not have changed anything about the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the property at Marienbader Platz.
In the end, economic reasons would have given the bill.
Now it is about preventing a long gap in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building proves to be cooperative."
Fujitsu's previously used house on the town hall square and the neighboring "Small Vertical" were among the most controversial construction projects in the town hall, along with the rest of the buildings on Marienbader Platz ten years ago.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new city tree was created between the railway station and the town hall, which gave rise to criticism both due to the massive construction of the areas previously used in part as parking space and the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment advisory and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel sales systems, Start Amadeus, and the then-associated computer manufacturer Fujitsu owned the houses.
The building used by Fujitsu was acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and a year later sold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu company is considered to be the world’s third-largest IT provider.
For example, it provides companies with computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The office in the Rhine-Main region is one of the largest in Germany, but Fujitsu has far more employees in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, the subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions in Frankfurt-Niederrad is expected to be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this, 7000 square meters were rented in the Astro Park office building.
In the twenty-year-old complex - the name plays on its star-shaped floor layout - the Central Electrical and Electronics Industry Association has its headquarters, among others.
Amazon blocks servers - threats against Assange
Wikileaks is getting more and more in trouble.
Internet service provider Amazon has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
Possibly political pressure is behind it after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomats.
Wikileaks founder Assange is reportedly staying in England.
Wikileaks’s disclosure platform is increasingly under fire in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their former U.S. server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and companies to boycott WikiLeaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol’s travel lists, is expected to stay in the UK after a news report.
"Wikileaks removed from Amazon server."
"Free speech in the country of the open", the Revelation activists told Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Recently, the internet company Amazon had banned WikiLeaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had resorted to the Amazon Web Service (AWS) when publishing secret diplomatic briefings to manage the high access numbers to the documents.
On Twitter, Wikileaks said: “Prima – our dollars are now being spent to employ people in Europe.”
If Amazon has such a problem with freedom of speech, “should they stop selling books.”
Amazon has stopped using its servers by Wikileaks after employees of Senator Joe Lieberman had engaged in investigations, CNN reported, citing the office of Lieberman.
The chairman of the Senate Homeland Protection Committee had threatened Amazon with a boycott, the British “Guardian” reported.
“I wish Amazon had taken this action earlier in the face of previous publications of classified information by WikiLeaks,” the senator said.
In the meantime, Lieberman called for the platform to be banned from using servers in other countries as well.
"Wikileaks' illegal, ruthless and reckless conduct puts our national security at risk and threatens the lives of the world," the Senator said in a statement.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should help WikiLeaks in its efforts to disseminate stolen material."
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is being sought by authorities in Sweden on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol’s travel list.
According to a report by the London newspaper The Independent, the 39-year-old Australian is known to be Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always referred to the investigations in Sweden as the intrigue of his opponents.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that there were threats.
"There were even calls after the murder of Julian Assange."
That's why Assange was right about his security, Hrafnsson said.
The Wikileaks founder will continue to hide.
Hrafnsson apparently responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had demanded that the person responsible for the WikiLeaks disclosures be charged and executed for treason.
In Canada, an adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper — apparently ironic — said on television that Assange should be “killed” and Obama could “use a drone.”
Between the White House and Assange, there was an exchange of blows.
U.S. President Barack Obama’s spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it “ ridiculous and absurd” that Assange had demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for recent spying calls to diplomats.
“I’m not quite sure why we care about the opinion of a guy with a website,” Gibbs said.
“Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more significant than its own website.”
The U.S. government is now putting the protection of its databases comprehensively on the bench.
Russell Travers, the deputy director of the Center for Anti-Terrorism Action, has been appointed as a special envoy, the White House said.
Travers is responsible for developing "necessary structural reforms" that became necessary after the disclosure of the embassy reports by WikiLeaks.
The White House also wants to see how the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. government has also announced that it wants to ensure the safety of dissidents and activists if they are threatened by WikiLeaks’ publication.
“We’ve done everything we can to get in touch with them,” said Philip Crowley, a spokesman for the foreign ministry.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
The Ice University
At "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice cream drinkers are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future gelatieri has the largest admission and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice actually come from?
From the gelatin and the gelatin.
The glacier, in German a bit old-fashioned of the ice cream confectioner, produces the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream making art.
The Gelataio takes the ice cream out of the refrigerator with a swab, squeezes it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know this, you do not need to drive to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But who wants to know more about ice, does not pass the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
Ice University established the manufacturer of ice machines in 2003 to ensure that the ice cream from its machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future gelatieri has the largest admission and visitors from all over the world.
But there are also several days of special courses around chocolate ice cream and practice in the home ice cream dish.
Some dream of a new career in the Midlife Crisis, while others simply dare on the smooth ice of their vague cravings.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents – from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the Slow Food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the industrial ice cream country in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and after years in a nervous job, she wants to support something of her own.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice rink in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars – and the Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-gelater Luciano Ferrari explains to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
Not only good taste is crucial, but also silky softness and good consistency.
Luciano, however, does not forget about the scenery of the national and even southern superstructure during his training: "Italian gelato is just the best - and then there is still a lot of romance with it."
The first step to manufacturing seems very simple.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer, which with an electronic program heats everything to 85 degrees and then immediately cools to four degrees.
Then he turns up a chicken on the machine, and comes out a pasteurized white base cream, the basis for all dairy varieties.
The lecturer is immediately bewildered with questions: Is it possible to make ice cream only with natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can you let your own experimental loss run free?
Luciano warns of being led astray by the spirit of time.
Those who speak of ice cream "only from natural ingredients" may still have used stabilizers - mostly a natural product, such as guar nut flour from guar beans.
Of course, you can also make ice without a stabilizer, only then it has to be sold within a day, otherwise it sacks in itself, and the customer bites on loud ice cubes.
Certain variations in the base mass are allowed.
It will be more exciting with the flavours.
For the taste of the ice, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients you buy in the fruit department or at the sweets of the supermarket.
There are also powders and pastes.
"The suppliers will try to turn you on dozens of flavored additives."
"But you should just experiment."
Either with the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or just the ice cream from the white base mass, which with eggs becomes the yellow cream and with cocoa powder the basis for all kinds of chocolate seductions.
Now the course participants are allowed to use the ice machines.
Luciano makes four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocca and hazelnut ice cream - with or without eggs in the base, with more or less vanilla flavor or other natural additives.
The fruit varieties are also subject to the same experiment.
More flavourings, more fruit-pure - tasty is not necessarily better.
Hazelnut ice doesn’t necessarily taste more nuts if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice cream produces the working group, which uses more fruits, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only a balanced mixture can properly highlight the taste of a gelato, says Luciano.
Icemaking is a computational task: If peppermint purée with a lot of sugar is used, the sugar proportion in the basic recipe must be reduced.
For lemon ice, an extra portion of sugar is required.
Luciano draws out a device with which he determines the sugar content of the fruits (winners thus measure the oechsle in the grape most).
Fortunately, tables facilitate computing.
Making ice no longer requires as much physical exercise as before.
Not only does the device help in the automatic production of the base mass.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mixture is simultaneously crushed creamy and cooled to minus temperatures.
In spite of all automation, small pans are not left out.
The Brazilian Gustavo claps himself and his classmates from top to bottom with fruit purée when he gets out of control by the over-dimensional rod mixer.
“In every course,” says Maestro Luciano, “it’s just a matter of time until something like that happens.”
Controllers in dual light
The European Food Authority (EFSA) is undermined by the gene-experimenting industry.
This accusation is now being formulated by the expert group Testbiotech, which sees itself as an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
“It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we’ve documented it well,” Test Biotech CEO Christoph Then said on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the Efsa Group of Experts on Genetically Modified Plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert have been under contract with the Ilsi Lobbyist Association for years.
It is paid by companies such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has decisively collaborated on the Efsa testing regulations for gene plants and is thus in a clear conflict of interest, criticises Then.
The EFSA regulations are literally equivalent to the position papers of Ilsi and thus draw the handwriting of the industry, which is actually to be checked by the authority in Parma, Italy.
This is the second time that Test Biotech has faced a conflict of interest.
So a senior Efsa manager was recently without an appointment or transitional period to the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta – and thus changed the pages.
The Central German Broadcasting Authority (MDR) had also recently unveiled staff links between the EU controlling authority and the industrial lobby, which made the Federal Environment Agency as well as EU parliamentarians clear.
However, the EFSA does not recognize any conflict of interest.
All serious data is used, including those of the industry, as long as they are of high technical quality.
Experts working for Efsa are not required to have no contact with the industry.
But you have to reveal them.
Kuiper is working for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
This is called a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics – including for risk assessment for biotechnology without a lobbying order.
In this case, independent experts such as Then are criticizing that genetically modified plants are currently allowed without any animal feed experiments and the reaction of genetically modified plants to environmental impacts is not tested.
"We want to know what genetically modified corn makes on the ground," says Then.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the entire gene plant, which does not deliver reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how should you find them?", then asks accusingly.
Angelika Hilbeck looks like that.
The scientist has been researching in gene engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical University of Zurich.
The industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in this area as well as in the United States in Europe.
Therefore, there are hardly any researchers who are not engaged with corporations.
Critical studies for companies would usually not be published.
"The industry controls security research," Hilbeck claims.
The Trail of the Stones
Uli Gsell has also taken care of some, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday night, he stood in front of Stuttgart train station, the tuba on his back.
It was a demo.
It's snowing.
The story is known: in September, the miners were pushed and had begun to break down a large piece of the northern wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: thousands protested against S21, the billion-dollar deepening of the station.
When it came to the end of the building, much of the wing was in ruins.
Broken into 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft rough stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He secured a few of the cracks.
"These stones are relics."
"You must not disappear."
He whispered, "A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthy."
When he resigned, he smelled like a cigarette.
He doesn't know what he's going to do with the cracks.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The trail of Stuttgarter Steine leads to a forest near Tübingen to a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
The 44-year-old trades with old stones.
He bought all of those who were involved in the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were to be grinded to shovel or disappeared in the depot," he says in his office, a wooden bucket that was once a guard house.
He was threatened and intimidated when he appeared in the newspapers in September that he had bought the rest of the northern wing from the destroyer.
But he has spoken to the S-21 opponents for days.
And he told them that he couldn’t do anything for the crash.
And if it ever happens, then it would be the most reasonable thing if the stones were re-used.
Approximately 200 S-21 opponents then took one of the 80-kilo-heavy squadrons, priced from 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a reminder, but some also in the hope of being able to return it in a reconstruction.
500 tons had been purchased, 25 large truck loads.
Almost half are still in the woods, the rest has been sold for a long time.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, house builders.
They had come from everywhere and had dragged away what the suitcase and trailers could carry.
The Stuttgart stones of the start have long been transformed into "mauernle" or into limitations of herbal beets.
"Actually, this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
"Don't be the political component."
He climbs into his field car, making a tour through his 20 acres of empire.
Jura studied and broke up, later in biology, then became interested in computers and eventually became a stone dealer.
And stone lovers.
40000 tons of stones are stored.
From all over Germany, he collects his treasures.
He says he is the largest antiquarian dealer in the Republic.
He's on the brakes.
In the snow lies artificially populated sandstones.
"They once belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke," he says.
Sandstone, yellow, warm, it's blackening.
"My Favorite Stone."
The road goes up through the forest.
It shows a pile of red sandstone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe railway station.
And go on.
"Beautiful travertin."
Once upon a time, the Quaders belonged to the Statue of the Stuttgart Neckar Stadium.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertin from the Stuttgart Police Bureau, red granite from the Dom Sankt Blasien, Tuff from the Heilbronner Hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how the stones were used to be crocheted by hand and moved with simple bottle pulls and ox carts, he becomes very frightened.
"It would be a scandal if you were to smash something like that."
He has not become rich, nor has he become rich in stone.
But 14 people are employed by the stone dealer today, and they have also settled in the top of the forest stone messes, a sculptor, a forger, a glass blower and a gardener.
"We work hard, but it is satisfactory," says the residue recycler.
Soon he will have to go to Cologne.
There are also rocks to save.
Talent Struggle for High Potentials
There's a buffalo in the buffalo.
16 students are pushing for salmon bread, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the automaker Volkswagen invited the engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of idea competition, they will be able to get to know Volkswagen together with VW developers about the car of the future – and just next door.
In the competition for the smartest minds, many companies are now coming to a close fight and, like VW, rely on cooperation with universities.
Your mission: Recruit the most talented graduates to the auditoriums as early as possible before they come to the job market and are recruited by others.
And because universities do not publish essays on the achievements of their students, one tries to sprinkle and tie the exceptional talents in practical projects.
On the second day of the workshop at TU Braunschweig, the auto companies promote the talents.
A young lady from the staff department distributes ballpoint pens, rubber bears and folders with VW logo.
She tells the promising young talent of internship programs and student jobs and shows them the ways in the group.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig oversees the project with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides: "Students come in contact with industry and gain experience."
"VW can simultaneously get to know students, look at interesting candidates and wonder who is in question as an employee."
Such cooperations, so Celle, are not unusual.
It’s so offensive to the students.
“The focus was more on the professional project,” says Selle.
The fight for the newly graduated will probably get even harder.
In many industries, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large number of applicants.
But they have to praise themselves, especially for highly skilled workers.
In particular, graduates from the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineering posts remained unoccupied in October.
And the so-called engineering gap will become even bigger, according to VDI forecasts.
For the KPMG business audit and consulting firm, Roman Dykta is going to the talent hunt.
He organizes challenging recruiting events such as the KPMG Race, a kind of modern cutting-edge hunt where participants have to find their way through GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students will be sending the company across the United States next year.
At the same time, the participants can view KPMG branches and get to know the company.
Those who are allowed to choose in two rounds of selection in advance.
Only the Crème de la Crème of many applicants flies to the United States.
As the high potentials of the universities are hauled and stitched, the shooters are increasing, according to Dykta.
"We want to get rid of the race."
"Just a simple sailboat was too little for us."
For talent hunter Dykta, the bill seems to go up.
"To date, we have been in contact with all participants of a similar campaign in the past year."
“Some are just ahead of their graduation and want to apply with us soon,” he says.
In addition to direct bullfighting on the campus, especially small and medium-sized companies are also very classical at trade fairs.
"We are trying to reach graduates at trade fairs."
"About the Intersolar," reports Sitha Stübe, staff manager at Solarworld.
The Bonner company employs around 1500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows about the problem of post-growth.
There are currently 35 vacancies on the company website.
"It's very difficult to occupy vacant positions right now."
“It costs a lot of time and money,” she says.
Another way is to get in touch with the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors give indications that you can do internships with us or write your diploma thesis."
Expensive promotions are not fashionable with solar specialists.
For this, the company tries to advertise for itself with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and light communication.
"This can often not be offered by a large group," says Stübe, staff manager.
Money no longer plays the main role in job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good climbing opportunities are other decisive factors.
Solarworld ranked 55th among the 100 best employers in Germany in a study by the Great Place to Work Institute.
The Institute draws up an annual list of the best German employers.
To do this, it asks employees how satisfied they are with their work and their job field and looks at the framework conditions for the employees.
Staff Manager Stübe also expects advantages from the placement among job seekers.
“I think applicants are looking specifically at external reviews about a potential employer,” she says.
Wolf Reiner Krieger from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to have more authenticity.
And that, according to the warriors, means primarily internal action.
“The best way to become attractive as an employer is through your own employees,” he says.
In the industry jargon, the internal employer branding is called, i.e., employer brand formation within its own workforce.
“Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors.”
If you treat your people well and identify with the company, they would advertise to their employer by themselves with friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a gang game," says Kriegler.
Obama Stops New Oil Drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the coming years.
A similar ban has been enacted by the government in Washington – and thus definitively revoked its earlier plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drilling is prohibited for the first time.
This was announced by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
A trigger for the strict ban, which is expected to apply for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the drilling platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the accident, which cost the lives of eleven workers and led to the biggest environmental disaster of the United States, President Barack Obama had signalled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico by pressure from the opposition and industry.
Proponents want to reduce U.S. dependence on oil supplies from abroad.
Whoever is responsible for the devastating oil plague in the Gulf has not yet been clarified.
At the heart of the criticism is the British energy group BP, which is facing billions of dollars in demand.
A commission of inquiry on behalf of Obama is expected to present its findings in December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the drilling stop imposed after the explosion.
Subsequently, several oil companies immediately applied for new drilling projects.
With stricter controls and stricter security regulations, Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new disaster.
Currently, the competent supervisory authority, which had been called into question after numerous allegations of corruption, is undergoing fundamental reforms.
At the same time, Obama announced that it would close lucrative tax evasion gaps for oil and gas companies.
The industry now publicly warns that the amount of funding in the Gulf would be significantly lower than before by stricter regulation.
“The government’s plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industry,” a recent industry survey by the consulting firm BDO said before Wednesday’s drilling ban.
The American Energy Alliance also complains about the uncertainty in the industry: “Nobody knows what will change with the regulation.”
Investment in new funding projects would be postponed until further - at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland is burned
The water in the rivers is oil brown, it smells like at the gas station: billions of litres of crude oil have destroyed nature in Nigeria’s Ogoniland.
People live from theft, corruption and illegal oil cooks.
Celestine Akpobari thinks it's good.
"Don't complain," the eco-activist reassures the journalists, "you will still get enough oil mud in front of the lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has pursued an attempt to illuminate a boy waving to his chest in the water with his surrounding mud: In the rainbow-colored water glow, the scene looks almost beautiful.
The fact that brown crude oil swades float under the surface cannot be seen.
Earlier, she had collected shrimp here forever, says Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
In the meantime, the slow flowing water is completely dead.
Five years ago, from a crushed pipeline, a lot of crude oil was poured into the huge wetland.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo must now roam for six hours to get into fish-containing waters: the Ogoniland, located in the heart of the Niger Delta, is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
On the way through the mangrove swamps flowing through river runs, the entire extent of the upheaval becomes apparent.
Instead of light water, the motorboat pours brown brooks, who puts his hand into the water, pulls out oily fingers.
The roots of the mangrove trees sprout from the ground like black lacrimal rods, sadly letting palms alone hang their beards.
Bird swarms, as they are common in wetlands, are sought in vain: as soon as the outer edge is silent, in the former paradise, smelling like a gas station, there is a ghostly tranquility.
“What’s happening here is ecological warfare,” says Celestine Akpobari, “we live in constant danger to health.”
The war comparison is appropriate.
The settlement of Ogoni is a battlefield fought for decades: here more than 60 years ago the first explorers from Europe came in, here in the 1980s organised with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. here was the first resistance, it had to be put to work for the Shell-Konzer product in 1993.
Today, the company still refuses to return to Ogoniland: while from the whole delta region of Switzerland’s triple size with more than 5,000 drilling springs and 7000 kilometers of pipelines are pumped daily more than two million barrels of black gold, the oil fields are located in the Kononiland, in Lagoniland.
All a few hundred meters of steel frames like bizarre sculptures from the water: "Christmas trees" are called the heads of the drill holes too tenderly.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them corroded to the mark.
Again and again such a drilling head break apart, means Akpobari, then a constant stream of crude oil flowed into the water.
More than two billion litres have flown into the Delta ecosystem in 50 years, according to experts: year by year, the amount of oil as it was pushed into the sea by Alaska 21 years ago in the havaries of the supertanker "Exxon Valdez", one of the largest environmental disasters in human history.
Anyone who is responsible for the ongoing eco-GAU will be challenged.
While the Shell Group’s sabotage and organised oil theft accounts for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmentalists see drilling heads and leaked pipelines as the main pollutants.
Shell sets significantly lower safety standards in Nigeria than usual in the world, U.S. scientist Richard Steiner told the group in 2008: “Only the rate of faults on the pipelines is “multiple times higher than elsewhere.”
In a place that looks from a distance like an abandoned, oily-looking workshop in the open air, the mangrove figures appear: they are split-naked and oily-looking to the neck.
Under one of the many barrels, which are partly connected with pipes, to be arbitrarily scattered on the ground, a fire flashes: an illegal small refinery.
In the barrel, the crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the group’s boss.
First, gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the pick-up cup, then drops kerosene at the end of the pipeline and finally diesel out.
Michael and four employees produce up to four 300-litre diesel barrels a day: "This brings us 34,000 Naira" - around <0x24>22.
The Delta people use the chronic fuel shortage in Black Africa’s largest oil state.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The illegal cooks can still undermine the ridiculously low diesel price at almost 40 euros per liter: because they get their raw materials for nothing.
It comes from "bunkers" that cross the pipeline network through Ogoniland: this is how experts say the country loses at least 16 million litres of crude oil per day throughout the Niger Delta.
However, only a disappearing small part of the provisionally interposed raw material is illegally processed: the lion’s share is filled with organized criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranking military personnel, in tankers and scraping it on the world market.
The debate as to whether the environmental disaster is more likely to be due to the turnover of the population or the lax mode of production considers Akpobari to be purely academic.
“If the oil companies weren’t perceived as intruders and didn’t destroy the fisherman’s life base so thoroughly, there would be no sabotage or theft and illegal refineries.”
Meanwhile, the Ogoni’s relationship with Shell has been so devastated that only a withdrawal from the group is in question: “Maybe other nationalities like the Chinese are better.”
Michael gets nervous.
"It's high time you disappear," says the muscular oilman.
"Every minute the soldiers can come."
If the illegal oil refiners are caught by the special forces, they are not under threat of arrest, but a painful lubricant.
The soldiers, mainly from the country order, also want to benefit from the raw material – like all Nigerians.
“This damn thing has brought our country to the dog in every way,” Akpobari says.
Investigators Detect Dangerous Construction Errors in A380 Engines
The A380 has a major security issue.
Investigators have discovered a possible construction defect in the investigation of a landed machine that could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
The airline Qantas now wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the landed Qantas Airbus in early November were apparently far more fortunate than ever before: the Australian Air Safety Authority has detected a major safety problem in the engines of some A380 engines during its investigations - and is now warning of a possible construction failure.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: If an oil hose connection occurs, it could cause fatigue and leakage, ATSB said in a statement published on Thursday.
This could have led to a “disastrous engine failure.”
Rolls-Royce-produced engines are affected in 20 A380-series aircraft.
Among them is the Qantas Airbus, which had to land in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
She filed a lawsuit with an Australian federal court in Sydney allowing him to take further legal action against the company.
Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said his airline would demand compensation for the incident in early November.
Parts of the engine had broken down and the bearing surfaces were damaged.
Rolls-Royce caused an oil fire as a cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines worldwide need to be replaced.
The Australian investigators announced that they would carry out further safety tests on the superjumbos equipped with the engines concerned.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan said.
The safety issue has been deemed sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines temporarily landed about three of its eleven A380s.
Lufthansa replaced the engine with an A380 as a precautionary measure.
The two-story aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
National snowfall triggers traffic chaos
Germany in white: Almost all over the country snowed overnight.
On many streets there is chaos, trains and flights fall out.
At least three people were killed in car accidents.
The winter freezes Germany: At ice temperatures, almost the entire republic is snowing at night on Thursday - which leads to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and east there are partially 15 centimeters thick snow covers.
On several motorways and many roads, traffic is severely restricted.
On the A7 near Flensburg, the winter service was in continuous use, but the constantly new snow was not finished.
In addition, fierce bows flew over the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Office for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) expects on the Baltic Sea coast of Schleswig-Holstein in the morning to storm floods with water levels of 1.2 meters above the normal level.
In Saxony, the snow rejection on highways and federal roads led to significant problems.
According to the weather-centric Meteomedia, in Saxon Switzerland, the alarm level was violet – the highest level at all.
Partly there fell 30 centimeters of snow, fresh and strong winds caused rejection.
Several trucks and cars stayed there at night.
Also in Saxony-Anhalt, the police authorities reported major disturbances on the roads.
On the A2 snow and wind led to stagnating traffic and stalemate.
In Thuringia, the A4 and A9 were affected by the snowfall.
According to Deutscher Bahn, there are significant disturbances in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the slopes, broken trees on the rails or destroyed overheads and slopes are the main problems.
In Saxony, the long-distance traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In the Thuringian Saalfeld, an ICE had to stop its journey to Munich.
The 165 passengers were supplied by firefighters and rescue workers with wool blankets, food and drinks on the train.
Snow winds swelled across the roads.
At major German airports, snow winds lead to numerous flight crashes.
In Munich, according to a spokeswoman for the flight information centre, some cancellations have already been reported.
In Frankfurt, 40 flights have already been cancelled, according to a spokeswoman for Fraport.
The winter service is in continuous use.
Although only a few beached passengers are at the airport, they still have almost 400 field beds available for them.
There were accidents on many streets on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver was killed in a collision with a train on a train crossing in Ostholstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
A similar accident occurred near Nuremberg due to snow-covered roads: here too, a truck was caught on a train crossing because the vehicle remained stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured in the train – the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore blocked until morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after crossing her car on a smooth road near Aschaffenburg.
The meteorologists have good news, however: Although the snow will still be loose and dusty, it will swell even in light bows.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is home to fast and stormy winds.
However, it remains very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate from its landmark: According to a newspaper report, the money house is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
Up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>500 million could be added to the property.
The Deutsche Bank has just made its Group seat beautiful: the twin towers in the Frankfurter Bankenviertel have been modernised; by now the bankers have been allowed back to their old workplace.
But now the financial corporation apparently wants to recover the cost of the renovation – and is looking for a buyer for the two high-rise houses, as the "Financial Times Germany" writes in reference to a spokesman.
The spokesman did not specify the reasons for the planned sale.
“We’re always checking whether it makes sense to own or sell real estate on our own and then rent it back,” he said.
Thus, Germany’s largest credit institution re-establishes its headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank had not taken over the double towers until mid-2007 for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>272 million from the investors of a domestic fund, and thereafter had to be a heavy renovation.
The energy conversion was estimated at around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 million.
A sale would probably bring the bank a lot of money.
Industry experts estimate the value of the towers now renamed "Greentowers", according to the newspaper, at around 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings are being re-sold to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor is still open at the moment, the spokesman said.
Thousands of people mourn their deaths
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand thought of the miners who were killed after several explosions in a mine.
Still, the bodies could not be recovered because the safety situation in the accident shaft is still precarious.
Almost two weeks ago there was a violent explosion in the Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners aged between 17 and 62 have been deployed in days.
A probe had been dropped in the mishap, but hadn't found any trace of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, no rescue forces were able to descend for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and experts assumed that there was no longer a chance for the friend to survive.
The bodies have not yet been recovered.
Now relatives and friends remembered with a memorial of the dead.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in Greymouth on New Zealand's southern island during the glowing sunshine.
They were silent for two minutes.
In honor of the scattered miners, 29 tables were set up on which helmets, lamps and the names of the friends were seen.
Images and personal items, including clothes and surfboards, also found their place here.
In front of the country’s government buildings, the flags were blowing on half-mast.
New Zealand has hoped that the miners would come back to the surface "from the depths of the earth", New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told attendees at the commemoration.
"But they never came home."
He could not end with the death of his son until he had seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was thrown into the pit.
In addition to the Prime Minister and relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemoration.
In the first explosion on November 19, miners of British and South African origin were also detonated.
Rescue workers began extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on New Zealand’s southern island.
As soon as the explosive gases are displaced, it will begin to cool the flammable temperatures inside the mine, police chief Gary Knowles told reporters.
Go to hell, warrior!
Is Splatter suitable for Art Cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn relocates old gender boundaries with his fighter epic "Walhalla Rising".
What audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when he filmed Wallalla Rising?
A captured Viking warrior with just one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his torturers and destroys his opponents with almost superhuman powers - sounds ideal for young male spectators in search of bloody action, just because our hero has a tendency to be angry when he has a tendency to be angry with his enemies.
On the other hand, Einauge, as it is actually called, tells the entire film not a word, and the other characters can be drawn at least once in one or two sentences or a few painful death cries.
Otherwise, you will be silenced and welded in the horribly beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland, which offers the scenery to the Viking world from about a thousand years ago.
Ideal for adults with an interest in existentialism and very quiet camera rides.
It’s nice if a movie has multiple target groups, it’s only bad if they exclude each other.
Director Winding Refn has been considered a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and stylish drug dealer trilogy "Pusher", but stoically refuses to make his works accessible to the mainstream with a little more humor or a little less brutality.
Most artistic cinema friends are likely to be distracted from the brain mass splashing around and the bowels.
Action fans die at the latest before long when, for free-to-interpret reasons, blindfolds break up with a troop of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem, trapped for an eternity in whirlwind and mist before the crew apparently arrives in America and continues there.
So it’s no wonder that Wallalla Rising has not found a movie rental in Germany and has now only appeared on DVD.
This is especially a shame because of the magnificent images, but also because behind the decorative to blood-thinking facade is a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogue or a stringent action, it’s all about atmosphere, a film-made fever dream.
There is no escape for the spectator.
Refn barely gives him a moment of relaxation and slowly sneaks into his throat with his ice-coloured images and the dark trance-like soundtrack, but above all with the inconceivable hatred that strikes him from the hearts of the characters.
Only a little blonde boy, who is faithfully on his side, keeps something like innocence, everyone else is driven by anger.
To most of the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, but who at some point becomes a warrior from hell for enemies and temporary allies, possibly the messenger of the devil himself.
It means spoiling, but perhaps only for the spoiled anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" is a riddle film that you can hate and admire to annoy, excitement, and amazement.
It's an experience.
Mysterious Earthworks
The IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
However, the country defends itself to take a position on this - it still allows controls.
At least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets attacked a mysterious, bubble-shaped building in Syria at midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007.
It stands on the banks of the Euphrates River; the next major city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor Syria allegedly built with the help of North Korea in the quader hidden in a valley that departs from the electricity.
According to a briefing by the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Agency at the end of April 2008, the common reactor, also called the nearby village of el-Kibar, would have been well suited to produce plutonium - from which nuclear weapons could be built.
For other purposes, on the other hand, the technique is scarcely enough from the fifties.
The CIA conducted a video presentation with unsightly satellite images.
By computer animation, it blended into which components of the reactor were supposed to have been before the destruction, which is a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center.
In addition, she presented photos showing the building from nearby or even the interior.
The reactor had stood just before the start-up, it was said, but had not yet been equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, is hardly more known than at that time, indeed the puzzles became rather larger with time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA was pretty sure before the attack that Syria was building a reactor in al-Kibar, but saw hardly any hint that there was an “active nuclear weapons program” in the country.
Some intelligence officers in Europe prefer to be even more cautious and speak only of a "appropriate reactor", even if they consider the CIA presentation to be "plausible".
They lack hard evidence, just like the IAEA.
Asked how sure he is to have a reactor in front of him, a senior UN diplomat answered only lapidar this summer that the IAEA has “enough material to ask questions.”
Although the Syrians were quick to take sides in the alleged "unused military building", they planned the site thoroughly.
However, in June 2008 an IAEA team under former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of human-made uranium in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite images of commercial providers from the time immediately after the attack, which are likely to be more pronounced than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown client - perhaps Israel - bought them exclusively.
The IAEA cannot independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always pretended never to have run a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
Uranus comes from Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
However, according to the analysis of the particles, the IAEA dismissed this as unlikely.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it – as well as the satellite images.
In addition, it denies the inspectors a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the debris of the decommissioned building.
Israel is also silent.
"We will never comment on this," Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, in charge of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
The investigation of the case has been incomplete since June 2008 and "is increasingly evolving into a serious credibility problem for the Authority", as a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna agrees - after all, there is a serious violation of the IAEA in the nuclear war.
The IAEA apparently sees three other facilities to be “functionally connected” to the supposed reactor as key to progress in lighting – and unlike the one that still exists.
Inspectors have so far not disclosed what facilities they are, what function they have or what makes them appear suspicious.
According to the South German newspaper, they are internally referred to by the IAEA as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, in turn derived from nearby cities.
The Independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (ISIS) has identified these locations and identified a building complex near Masyaf on satellite images, most likely one of the suspected objects.
It may be located in or directly next to a military base – precisely with this justification, Syria denies access to the three locations.
In Vienna, it is said that the Syrians feared a fishing expedition – that the IAEA would be sent out of the US to sweep out military equipment.
Because the nuclear detectives had become aware of the facilities by a tip of the U.S. intelligence services.
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos, that material was transported back and forth between the three locations and the square on the Euphrates River.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the facilities could be "related to fuel production".
However, there are "no indications of sensitive activities", i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is powered by uranium, which is not enriched.
But where uranium should have come from and where plutonium for the bomb should be separated from later on, there are at least plausible assumptions about these central questions.
It is also unclear whether ruins that could store valuable traces were stored in the three locations.
As if the hundreds of truck loads had disappeared from the ground, no one wants information about where the sludge has remained.
The salt mine al-Tibni, located just a few kilometres from al-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates River, which Syria investigated in 1998 on its suitability as a storage for radioactive waste, is considered unlikely by the IAEA.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley recently linked it to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned magazine Jane’s Intelligence Review.
Images from the orbit show, however, that Syria undertook groundwork at the three suspected locations and removed large containers after the IAEA requested access.
This may be a coincidence, but has barely helped clear the suspicion.
In addition, it says in diplomatic circles, the IAEA has spent several months developing a plan for inspections there that should allow Syria to keep any military secrets - only the effort shows how much interest the inspectors have.
Indeed, Damascus rejected this proposal as well.
Had western diplomats in Vienna softened even a year ago, the reactor had been destroyed, so the matter hasn't got a high urgency, for example U.S. Ambassador Glyn Davies has been putting into play a few months of so-called special inspections.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who should propose these inspections, has already talked about "an option for which I am open in the future", but he still hesitates.
There is a high risk in this way: for one, it requires a majority in the IAEA Governing Council, and some of the 35 countries represented there are all but awkward to escalation.
On the other hand, as a diplomat says, "What if they finally find nothing?"
Love in times of war
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her yet unnamed directorial debut in the summer, there has been trouble.
She wrote the script herself, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
You don’t know much more about it – but that’s enough for rest.
The rumor persists that the woman, a Muslim, falls in love with her Serbian rapists during the Yugoslav War.
Bosnian women’s associations immediately protested, after which some planned days in Sarajevo were relocated to Hungary in the short term.
Meanwhile, the film has been filmed in Hungary and post-production, but it is still being protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the Women's War Victims Organization wrote about the UN Refugee Assistance Agency (UNHCR) to Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, has now reported a Bosnian newspaper - Jolie is herself an ambassador for the UN Refugee Assistance Agency.
She is not diplomatic - she offered women a meeting in Hungary a few weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
There were no love stories in rape camps, and Jolie's attitude towards the victims told her enough about the script.
According to the UN refugee relief agency, her organization has recommended that Jolie be fired as an ambassador, the Guardian reports.
But what exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which was able to read her script, has, after some time, granted a rotation permit for Sarajevo – it’s not quite clear why Jolie didn’t come.
The young author herself claims that she does not pursue political intentions with her film, has worked hard in the Yugoslavia conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all the parties involved.
In terms of content, however, it remains vague.
This is how a second synopsis of the film goes about on the net, which then sounds quite different: the lovers knew each other before the outbreak of the war and met again when she, a Bosnian Muslim, is trapped in a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What does sound significantly different from the variant "Violent Victims of Rape Get Involved in Torture Slave".
That Jolie’s movie actually started before the war – so much is for sure.
The pressure on them, Jolie said, is “unfair and based on misinformation.”
Now, only the hackers of Hollywood will be able to make peace by illegally putting the script, as so many have done before, into the net.
Nothing like away from here
This evening, it finally goes right around for the Irish.
No trace of confusion.
For this, the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
Fans cheer for joy in crawling loud music, they stamp with their feet.
The Bailey pub in South Cork is booming because players throw table tennis balls over a three-meter distance in beer bowls - and hit them.
"Bierpong" is called the bizarre spectacle, to win there are 500 euros winning prize plus airline tickets to Las Vegas for the Beerpong World Championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this creepy drinking game and the reluctant computer scientist that doesn’t really fit together.
And yet the 26-year-old tries to have fun in distracting himself from the boring question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not to have fun in Las Vegas, he will be conducting application interviews in New Zealand in January.
"I have a mummy feeling about it," he says.
"It's so far away from home and I still have no work there."
After all, his girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "She had a back, despite her wish job as an event manager, maybe a good sign," says the young man, smiling.
Due to poor prospects at home, two of Tanner’s three siblings have already sought their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, and his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys go: As with the tanners, it looks like on the island in many families.
100,000 Irish will likely leave the country in the near future, experts at the Economic and Social Research Institute ESRI in Dublin predict.
By 2015, there will be 200,000 emigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants a heavy loss.
If the forecasts remain true, there will be a wave of migration comparable to that under which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of revival, which brought great prosperity to the Irish, sadness is now growing again.
In particular, the economic crisis insecures the young, well-educated Irish people, for whom so far it was only mountainous.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was needed, money was in abundance.
Three out of ten women and men under the age of thirty are unemployed.
In the Irish Times, there are letters of readers of young immigrants complaining, "Everything goes down in Ireland."
“There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers – but who can go away and our country is losing an entire generation.”
"Then please turn off the light."
Jura student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees a dark future erupt because the government only runs eye-catching and gives young people no more prospects.
“They’re reducing minimum wages, but they don’t have a strategy for creating new jobs,” the 20-year-old says.
She observes her commilitons swinging from an unpaid internship to the next.
Her biggest concern, she says, is whether to have to emigrate in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to occupy the subject positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a trade fair that offers a comprehensive service on working abroad.
“For beginners, working abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps on the career leader,” says the manager.
On his website, photos show surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not a gallery service, but also brings freedom and fun.
How it feels to build something elsewhere, Seán O’Donovan has known for six months.
Because there was nothing to do with the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen, they are building a fashion house.
In January, it will continue to Hannover or Berlin, to the next project.
O’Donovan now sees his home very rarely, as he makes extra layers to pay off the loan for his home.
"The situation is already a little crazy," he says, as he crosses the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
“I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I’m pretty much never again.”
He laughs a little shy and walks through cooled rooms.
The small house is located in a fine residential area with well-kept front gardens, in the entrances park large, expensive cars.
Together with a sister, O’Donovan bought the house for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>380,000 four years ago – 100 percent of its credit.
“It was crazy times, there was simple money without a lot of questions,” he says.
Is he afraid that the loan could go wrong?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, pours hot tea and says, "I don't have children to feed and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start over again."
The construction engineer doesn’t like the softness that he often hears at the moment.
“No one needs to be hungry – our situation is far from as dramatic as it was in the past here on the island,” he says.
“Working abroad for a while, that’s not the worst thing that can happen – maybe it only makes us feel like Irish.”
He laughs and then tells of his father, who went to England in the last major economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back there and life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Reveal the future and just look at what life is like elsewhere.
He has worked in London for a few years, and why should it not be good for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But there’s one thing that really worries him these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He's afraid it could turn into a well-being party.
"Don't bleed too many emotions," he says and drinks a big drink of his beer.
"Yeah, that sounds scary."
"Let's call it a walk-in party, quite casual, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The Democratic Routine
The movement for democracy in Latin America is becoming stronger, as is the support of private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, Brazil’s influence is greater than that of the United States.
These results included the Latinobarometer survey, which was conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been conducted on a regular basis since 1995 and shows the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts are particularly noteworthy in this year’s poll of September and October.
First of all, the good mood in Latin America
And secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its most important institutions.
In many countries on the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has increased sharply (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has grown by about 6% annually since 2002, the number of proponents of democracy has increased from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Also in Mexico, where the economy has recovered since the sharp breakdown last year, such a trend can be seen.
However, only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the region’s most populous countries, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Figure 2).
Approximately 44% of respondents said they were satisfied with their country's democratic practice, which is as many as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Chart 3).
Approximately 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both values correspond to those of last year, but show a marked increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24%, respectively).
A decade ago, Latin America’s economic crises undermined efforts for more democracy.
This continued even during the global economic crisis, possibly due to the fact that the countries of Latin America only experienced a short period of recession and recovered quickly.
In addition, the poor were captured by a stronger social network.
(According to reports from the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the poverty rate in Latin America rose only slightly in 2009 and fell again this year by 32%.)
However, there are strong differences in mood from country to country (see diagram 4).
Brazil’s strong economy and the popularity of divorced President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread progression.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more noticeable and violent crimes have increased, this is less the case.
For the second time since the start of the survey, many surveyed in Latin America see a greater problem in crime in their country than in unemployment (see Figure 5).
Approximately 31% say that either they or a family member have been the victim of a crime in the past year, but compared to 38% in the past year, the values have fallen and thus reached the lowest level since 1995.
Increasing economic performance is reflected in the stronger support of the private and market economy: about 71% of respondents said overregionally that the private sector is indispensable for development, while in 2007 it was 56% (see Chart 6).
Approximately 58% said that only the market economy can make progress for their country, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private sector), although their left president, Hugo Chávez, has nationalized many private companies.
According to Brazil, 19% of respondents (18% last year) have the highest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
The respondents in Mexico and most Central American countries, on the other hand, see the U.S. as the most influential country, with this role being assumed in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua by Venezuela.
A ballot box
No one expected the November 28 elections in Haiti to be perfect.
But the facts far outweighed the fears of the electorate, who were in a hurry to help the plundered country.
Overcrowded polling hours, multiple votes cast, ballots in the Rinnstein, destroyed polling stations, and intimidation were only part of the problems.
Elections opened with an hour-long delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom had become homeless by the January earthquake, were wandering around looking for a choice.
Some eventually gave up completely.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some alleged top riders, called for the cancellation of the election results due to alleged fraud.
There have been some violent protests throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the head of the UN mission in Haiti, called the election "a fairly good one in many interests".
According to a careful statement by observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, "these irregularities, however serious they may be, do not necessarily invalidate the process".
In other words, the show goes on.
The election authority, which is allegedly obliged to the unpopular divorced President René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the provisional results on 7 December.
Expected polling is scheduled for January.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, rap musician Michel Martelly and former First Lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial invalidity claim.
If Jude Célestin, who finds little or no approval among the voters, declares the electorate to be the winner of the ballot, this could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the earthquake victims still live in tents, little participation was feared.
On Election Day, many Haitians were prevented from voting due to a lack of organization.
Shortly before the election, about 250,000 passports needed for the election were not yet distributed.
There's a lot at stake.
The donor countries see a legitimate, recognized government as an important step in rebuilding Haiti.
The Haitians themselves have the same opinion.
Home in the middle
In the weeks after her husband’s sudden death, Argentine President Cristina Fernández experienced a wave of sympathy, pushing her popularity rate up by 20 points to over 50%, the highest value since her election in 2007.
However, whether or not you will help in a re-election next year depends on whether the apparently sad Cristina Fernández is more compromised than her deceased husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs for this are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who also led economic policy after his wife’s election, often formulated budget plans that did not fully take into account tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential couple to spend the extra income at their own discretion.
On paper, the Fernández government lost a majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided and Kirchner’s death following a heart attack on October 27 led to further devastation.
Some regime critics from the ranks of the ruling Peronists stood behind Cristina Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (where one parliamentarian struck another in the face and others criticized the government of extortion), Congress failed to pass the 2011 budget.
“I’m not going to discuss it,” the president said.
The 2010 budget is now also applicable for the next year, which gives the President even more opportunity to spend money at her own discretion.
The economy is running hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
For example, the official inflation rate is 11.1%, but numerous private estimates – and wage requirements of the trade unions – push the value to almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, declared growth and poverty control to its main goals, not inflation reduction.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, harassed the private sector and cleaned up the National Institute of Statistics and Census INDEC, which then beautified the official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández now take a more moderate path?
She called on the private sector and the trade union leaders to talk.
According to official statements, wage increases are expected to be limited to 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina’s agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
However, inflation undermined the growth spurt by a major devaluation in 2002.
For this reason, Cristina Fernández may want to rejoin Argentina financially to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government reached an agreement with securities holders, who had rejected the country’s previous transfer of debt in 2001.
Now Fernández seems to be pushing for an agreement with the Paris club’s donors, to whom she owes about <0x24>6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always refused an IMF verification, as is usual elsewhere.
But last month, Minister for Economic Affairs Amado Boudou announced that the fund will provide "technical support" in the creation of a new national consumer price index, which looks like this is the first step to clean up the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active even without the support of her husband after her term.
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which has largely enough of Churchanism.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy that has been given to them will be ejected.
If she wants to win another election, she has to decide whether to cancel many of her husband’s political decisions quietly and quietly.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan’s voters are slowly approaching a closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of his big brother beyond the seaside?
On November 27, more than 7.5 million voters, 70% of all eligible voters, voted to elect mayors and city councils in the five districts, which is assessed as a broad assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
By building groundbreaking business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma himself is a symbolic figure for relations with the mainland. His policy has changed the relationship with the Chinese motherland sustainably for the first time since 1949.
Ma passed the exam, but barely.
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) represents three of the five mayors, it did not receive a majority.
Instead, the Democratic Progress Party (DPP), which advocated greater independence from Taiwan, received nearly 50% of the votes that KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election, this would have been a problem for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, his party’s share of votes has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even joined the city council together with the KMT.
During the election, it came to the common occurrences in Taiwan such as truck convoys with crawlers, flag-swinging mass movements, and only sparsely dressed dancers.
There was even the compulsory, mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan and Honorary Chairman of the KMT, gave a speech to a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
When a man from the crowd shot him in the face, Lien was wounded and a nearby spectator was killed.
Bizarrely, it’s not clear whether the shooter wanted to kill Lien or join a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless, the attack, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, affected the election and pushed the DPP into a bad light, giving the KMT more votes.
Perhaps China was the biggest winner of the campaign.
Interestingly, the relationships with the mainland were not discussed.
Instead, the candidates debated plans for social housing and the creation of jobs.
Taiwanese people love their actual independence and reject China’s military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like to put its relations with the government in Beijing at the forefront.
But this time, the DPP also avoided squeezing anti-Chinese feelings too much.
She thus reacted to the new awareness that Taiwan’s economy cannot survive without China.
Ma, in turn, wants to confirm that the majority of Taiwanese people support his China policy.
The Beijing government will continue to pursue its strategy to attract Taiwan back to the Community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a dealer to Taipei to prepare for a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
It certainly wants political integration too, but the most important thing first.
It is better to wait until after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has now been reinvented.
Two years ago, she was greatly weakened: former party leader Chen Shui-bian was imprisoned for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he vehemently advocated absolute independence.
But under Tai’s regency, a new generation of moderate politicians developed and the DPP is fighting for the voices of the workers and youth.
Tsai found great approval as DPP presidential candidate, like Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Her party is now doing everything it can to show that it is also able to build close relations with Beijing.
Tsai is planning a forge of ideas as a point of contact between the DPP and China, but this requires unbiased discussions.
Tsai publicly stated that her party offers a "trustworthy alternative" to mass rapid approximation of China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
From his cell, he explained that the DPP candidates would have done better to insist on Taiwan’s independence.
He even called on the pragmatist Su to resign from the presidential nomination.
Even without Chen’s interference, the DPP finds it difficult to choose its potential candidates.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
Mas values are poor, despite the rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to run their election campaign without him.
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the ever-increasing scraps between poor and rich.
According to a KMT spokesman, he will redesign his cabinet as well as the local facilities.
The strong presence of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is only limited in favour of a rapprochement.
At the same time, most Taiwanese view economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is no longer a backward".
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly nominated in the category Newcomer of the Year
If you show up at the request of a president, people will notice it.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to perform at the 2009 Nobel Prize ceremony, and the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer was nominated for this year’s Grammy in the category of Newcomer of the Year.
Given the fact that Spalding has already been a celebrated star in the jazz scene since her album "Esperanza" in 2008, the nomination appears a bit unusual, but it corresponds to the Grammy rules, according to which an artist was released before the release of the album.
Her ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", is certainly a step forward. And with her swinging voice and a good sense of pop, radio and Latin music, you can easily compare Spalding with Norah Jones 2003, whose great success in 2003 as a jazz performer in this category comes to mind.
In addition, the Vijay Iyer Trios' album "Historicity" was nominated in the category of instrumental albums.
Iyers' competitors include "Moody 4B" by experienced saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboardist John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a New Orleans robbery favorite and frequent guest in HBO's "Treme", has been awarded in the category of Contemporary Jazz, where albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber are more likely to be found.
The Secret Society of the wild Steampunk musician Darcy James Argue has received much-deserved attention in the big group category, so he goes against Billy Child's Emsemble with his chamber jazz and adventurous Dave Holland and his octet, whose life-ablum is an example of a "Pathsyderways" band.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in classical categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Grammy Award include a colourful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list is led by Michael Daugherty's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra with five voices, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestra, with three voices.
Among the nominees with connections to Southern California is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his No. 4 symphony "Los Angeles", which was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonics and premiered in 2009 at the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
The L.A.-based composer Avner Dorman was also nominated for his mandoline concert.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
In the category of classical producers, five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classical albums are Bruckner's symphonies No. 3 and 4 from the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" played by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" from the Arts and Sacrigens from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Voquirti.
In the opera category, Bergs were "Lulu from the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasses "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" from Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariahos "L'Amour de Loin" from the German Symphony Orchestra Berlin; Rodion Shchedrins from "The Enchanted Art of the National Wanderer" from the Orchestra Van Vandermin.
As composers, Pärt was nominated for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionamentos Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" for a Grammy.
Pärt’s Symphony No. 4 was performed and recorded by the L.A. Philharmonics in the Disney Hall on January 4.
The 30-minute piece is titled "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil magnate Mikhail Chodorkowski, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondolinenkonzert" received a nomination in the category Instrumental solo with orchestra.
The L.A. composer stated that he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for the mandolin artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New Yorker Metropolis Ensemble.
"I have used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African tones and rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
The conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the orchestra category for a recording of Strawinski’s works with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
The instrumental soloists were the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, the organist Paul Jacobs, the violinist Julia Fischer and the harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, only women were nominated as vocal soloists, including Anne Sofie of Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of classical crossover, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Mosque in Temecula wins approval of Planning Committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula, after a five-hour, often hot public hearing, found the unanimous commitment of the local planning committee.
Critics accused the project of promoting both terrorism and traffic jams.
However, according to a statement by the Commission on Wednesday evening, the new religious center is in line with local regulations and will become an aesthetic eye-catcher.
"The project is supported by many good people - Christians, Jews, Bahá'ís, and many others," said Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley on Thursday.
"As an American, it makes me proud."
"It shows that justice reigns."
“There are few opponents,” he added.
"They're just very loud."
"In this valley live wonderful people."
The meeting began at 6 p.m. and discussions for and against the construction of the centre lasted almost until midnight, with votes on both sides being fairly evenly distributed, according to Press-Enterprise.
The debate was continued on the newspaper’s website.
"There is no more America," said a comment.
"It's another planet of monkeys, and the Statue of Liberty is dead in the sand."
“America is at the end.”
Planned Islamic centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, such as near Ground Zero, the scene of the terrorist attacks on New York City on September 11, 2001.
In Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush called for nonviolence.
His community of about 135 families has lived peacefully in Riverside County for years, but they wanted a bigger and better place than the warehouse they had rented together with a water filter plant manufacturer.
The new 2,300 m2 mosque in the Mediterranean style is said to have two minarets and to be about 13 m high.
It is intended to be built on the approximately 17,500 m2 property on Nicolas Road near Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still object to the project at the City Council.
Arsenic-resistant microbe could enable new life forms on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign species of bacteria that can live from arsenic, among others, opens up new possibilities for new life forms on Earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists have discovered this unusual bacteria here on Earth, it is, in their opinion, a sign that life is possible without the elements previously considered vital.
"This organism has two options."
"It needs either phosphorus or arsenic to grow."
“That makes it something very special, even though it’s almost a kind of ‘foreign’ way of life,” said Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears in the online issue of Science on Thursday.
So far, six main elements have been considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
But as scientists found out, the bacterium in California’s Mono Lake grows even further when it replaces phosphorus with arsenic.
"You're wondering what else is possible," said Ariel D. Anbar, co-author of the report from Arizona State University.
Discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, as scientists need to recognize life and its forms.
The study deals with microbes found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference in which no details of the discovery were announced gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could act on the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This is not the case.
The discovery “shows that organisms in other planetary systems can initiate biochemical processes with the help of other elements and that the ‘standard elements’ that we think are absolutely vital are not necessarily defined,” said Charles Cockell, professor at the University of Verrichten at the Planetary and Space Sciences Institute of Keenenen.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
"This work is a novelty because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures one element can be replaced by another," Cockell added.
This discovery was not a coincidence.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA’s Astrobiological Institute, who led the study, chose the Mono Lake because of its high arsenic content.
Because arsenic and phosphorus are chemically identical, she assumed that microbes exposed to both may be able to replace one element with another.
“The toxicity of arsenic is mainly due to its chemically similar behavior to phosphorus.”
"This makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from another."
"But the difference is so great that arsenic acts differently than phosphorus. It gets into our biochemical system, where it lubricates almost everything," explains Anbar.
The researchers exposed the GFAJ-1 bacterium to an increasing concentration of arsenic. It adjusted and grew.
Although the microbe grows better in phosphorus, it can also survive in arsenic, showing that an arsenic-based form of life can occur naturally, either on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic occurs more frequently.
According to Jamie S. Foster, professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is not new, but so far there has been no working example.
Arsene occurred more frequently in the early Earth years, she says, which is why science has assumed that early life forms have used it.
"This gives us reason to believe that life may have evolved differently than in the early Earth age," said Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simons' research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Authorities.
Other Stolen Exhibition Dogs Found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibition dogs stolen from a Bellflower motel were found, according to a statement by the Los Angeles County Sheriff on Thursday.
The four exhibition dogs – two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis – disappeared on Tuesday when unknown stolen the 2006 Chevrolet Express van in which the animals were housed in front of a Bellflower Motel 6 at night, authorities said.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday evening, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is, the dogs are running," Whitmore said.
"They're in good condition."
"They were returned to their legitimate owners."
Whitmore did not provide accurate information about the dog’s founding and the circumstances that led to its discovery.
"The investigations are still ongoing."
“We don’t want to say that anymore,” Whitmore said.
"We're tracking some traces."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available for information on Thursday.
They received their two dogs on Wednesday afternoon at a county pet home in Downey.
Representatives of the sheriff found the van and the two dogs at different locations in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old bull, and Didi, a 10-month-old dog - were unharmed, according to authorities.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, who Rickard and Peek wanted to present on behalf of their Japanese owners at the competition this week, remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town this weekend for the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach because Trace was expected to participate in the competition.
As Peek told the Times on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in other competitions in the days ahead of the AKC/Eukanuba show.
Southern California is a stop on the couple’s nearly one-month tour of Dog Show to Dog Show.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their van in front of their room window.
They took three other dogs – a boxer whale, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany – into their motel room.
The fatty Akitas and Corgis stayed in the van because it was cooler there.
They left the window wide open, so that the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car on Tuesday at 6:00 a.m. as being stolen.
Peek promised anyone who could give a hint to the Corgis a finder's salary. The animals were implanted with microchips to identify them.
On Thursday, it was not clear whether a finder’s salary would be paid.
The lion roars again after court approval of MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got a green light for a new start.
A New York bankruptcy judge on Thursday officially blessed the "prepared" creditor plan to pay off <0x24>5 billion in debt and pave the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company for new movies and television shows.
According to statements from Thursday, the plan meets the requirements of U.S. bankruptcy law, so that the restart of MGM under the leadership of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, is nothing more in the way.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to about 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 does not actually come into effect until JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned <0x24>500 million bond to finance the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the investment bank, which itself raises <0x24>75 million, is running the company, which is expected to be financed by mid-December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the commission to investing bank Moelis & Co, the company’s management, which struggled with interest payments of <0x24>300 million/year, to help solve their financial problems.
In August, CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO at Enron and a restructuring expert known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper’s efforts to solve MGM’s financial concerns and pay off the more than 140 creditors of the studio took longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties decided to offer the company for purchase at the end of 2009.
But the auction attracted only a few bidders and no one wanted to pay the <0x24>2 billion demanded by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, it all started from scratch when the MGM team started the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by the creditors after months of debates and internal disputes at the end of October.
If MGM officially survived the bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a bonus of several million dollars for their work.
The share of Moelis & Co., which has already received <0x24>1.2 million, is <0x24>9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid <0x24>375,000 a month for running the company, receives a <0x24>4 million "success bonus".
Barber and Birnbaum are planning to resume production at MGM. This year, the studio just released one film and created an annual plan with seven or eight films to be released in early 2012.
They are also planning two films after "The Little Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a separate bond of between <0x24>265 million and <0x24>275 million for its financial contribution to these two films, which are set to be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who has funded about 18% of the MGM loan, tried to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, whose largest shareholder he is.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies resulted in no results.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year’s favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both gamers can break a considerable hole in your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for <0x24>99, while the price for a Kinect game is about 10 classic spring ropes or about 48 cans of Play-Doh.
But you can save your gift budget.
Recently, in search of three electronic toys under <0x24>80, I visited three national toy dealers - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moore’s law had come into force. This year, the technology toys are more powerful and at the same time cost slightly less than last year.
And although fewer new toys will appear with their own website, the most famous of these types, Webkinz and Club Penguin, has a wider offer.
There are more and more button-cell-powered toys on the market, and many include rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(Unless otherwise stated, all prices for Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, <0x24>13, for children from 3 years of age) are plush figures, as big as sea pigs, singing a note when pressing on their belly.
Pressing once corresponds to a note, by pressing multiple times you can play a song.
Several Sing-a-ma-jigs sing in Harmony.
Attention: Once you have started pressing, you can’t stop anymore.
For a combination of send and dance, the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price <0x24>60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
Based on the Elmo Live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll offers gameplay like 'Simon says', and thanks to its brand new wheel-blocked hinge foot, it dominates the Moon Walk.
Kids who tested the device use Mickey as a dance teacher, but their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you’re a child of the 80s, remember Alphie, one of the first computerized learning toys.
Now he’s back there (Hasbro/Playskool, <0x24>40, for children from 3), with a whole bunch of questionnaire cards that can be used to make a car ride to a lesson, with a better proof with auto-correction function as a teacher.
If you don’t want to entrust your smartphone to your child, here are three independent alternatives.
MobiGo by VTech (<0x24>60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. However, the games included are not as educational as the Leapster Explorer (<0x24>70, for children from 3 to 12), which, according to Leaprog, is the first major revised version of Leapster.
None of the versions are compatible with older cartridges.
iXL from Fisher-Price (<0x24>90 for children from 3 to 7) used for games and eBooks a system similar to iTunes, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed on it.
Last but not least there is still Scrabble Flash (<0x24>30 from Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are not larger than a string wooden box and have their own LED screen.
The game is about assembling the blocks into words before the time runs out. It is great for an improvised letter beer competition.
More and more toys have a kind of online connection.
If you go to toy stores on your own, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
For example, to give your child an online pet at the Club Penguin, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match figure pack (<0x24>5 for children from 6 to 12) containing a coin with a secret code.
When you enter the code online, your child will receive enough credits for two more parts in the Club Penguin Store.
These can be roller boots or a puffle fabric animal.
The latest head cell-powered microbot, Hexbug Nano (<0x24>10 for children from 5) is not bigger than the head of your toothbrush.
The skull moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him through an illusion garden made of clay.
And he can handle a lot.
Ours fell from the kitchen table and even survived some time in the mouth of our dog.
Police operations in China are getting softer
As a training officer, Tang Shenbin walks over an urban square, checking his nervous subordinates, giving orders with military authority and a dampened voice.
He wanted his female members of Chengguan - China's robust guards of urban order, to be feared and despised for their arbitrary raids and their tendency to violence - to impress the spectators.
"Just standing!"
"Look straight!"
"Show them," he whispered to them, "how pretty girls are!"
Four girls, barely grown up at teenage age, with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and pants stood tight.
Four pairs of black pumps stood in straight line.
Four decent hats sat perfectly on the hair held with blue-white striped loop.
"For me, they look average," Mr. Tang notes with little appreciation.
"Models are pretty."
Several governments have already tried to polish the image of China’s city inspectors.
In a city, all new applicants must have a university degree.
The province of Guangdong introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the gray greens.
Wuhan in Central China replaced violence by low-stars: In 2009, 50 officials reportedly rounded up an improperly set up car and stared at the operator until he packed it after half an hour and left the place.
Xindu, a city district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to change the image fundamentally.
Since 2003, 13 women have been strengthening the urban police force, and they have been specially selected because of their appearance, their good character and their youth.
They should give the cowardly police a softer, feminine aspect.
But unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would hardly be able to improve the bad image that the Chinese have of these city commands.
Right, the critics say.
Unlike the police, these officials are only allowed to enforce urban laws by means of fines or other administrative penalties.
However, the Chinese media routinely shows a different picture.
In January 2008, officials in Hubei Province smashed a spectator to death as he filmed her with his phone as she smashed a protest against a garbage bin.
Last year, a training manual of Beijing officials was stolen and published on the Internet, describing how criminals can be smuggled without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon dealer suffered brain injuries following a handful of five officials.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the internet shows China’s trained officials in an attack on street vendors.
"Chengguan is frightening the government," the national newspaper China Daily lamented last year, after further controversy over the tactics.
The newspaper called for a "really thorough cleaning".
Skeptics find the current approach clearly insufficient.
When the district searched for eight female recruits by ad in October, an editorial in Beijing Evening News asked whether women had real tasks or should only serve as optical distractions.
Probably both.
According to job ads, women aged 18 to 22 were sought with a good figure and "harmonious facial features".
They should be above average - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The employment relationship ends when you reach the age of 26.
According to officials, the activity for women over 25 is too physically exercising.
“The most important thing is their image,” an unnamed district official on the quasi-government website Rednet.com said.
"Whether candidates get the job depends first on their external appearance, such as size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes temperament and "internal qualities".
"Female Chengguans are like flower vases," he said, adding, "but beyond that, they have other duties."
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Head of the City Administration of the District, does not wish to enforce this description,
However, in China, size requirements in job ads for both sexes are not uncommon.
The same applies to uniform facial features.
Whether this is to be matched with a good look is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical disabilities do not need to apply.
"Unfortunately, we can't use lambs or buckles here," said Mr. Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who is patrolling on the Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22, has apple cakes and a well-shaped mouth.
She did not feel as sexist that so much importance was placed on her appearance.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks with an ironic look.
Her colleague, the 21-year-old Xu Yang, commented, "We have the task of representing the image of the city."
According to their data, they do not regret the short hiring, as they have more ambitious career plans than simply shoving merchants through the streets to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning the strip deals with about twelve street dealers who try to sell as many breads and tofu dishes as possible on foot or on a bicycle before they are hunted.
"Mr. Wang, please get out of here."
"We have told you so many times!" explains Fr. Xu to a merchant who had fled on foot and had temporarily left his nutmeg kitchen attached to a bicycle cart.
According to the officials, the activity is more monotonous than strenuous.
"It's almost the same every day," explains Huang Jing, 20, who studies in leisure sales.
"All the routine."
One reason for this is that female officials are not allowed to confiscate the merchandise of merchants, like their male counterparts.
They can only threaten criminals to report them to their male superiors.
This is intended to protect them from public attacks, to which officials in China are often exposed.
This year, hundreds of residents of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, randomized after rumors broke out that Chengguan officials had killed a merchant.
More than a dozen police officers and Chenguan officials were injured in the night incident, 14 government vehicles were discarded or set on fire.
Xindu has been spared from such violence so far.
However, disturbances cannot be excluded.
Just two blocks from the quiet Baonguang Square, where the female officials patrolled this morning, more than 50 people gathered at a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that was repaired against the regulations on the road instead of in a workshop.
The owner screamed Zeter and murdered.
After 15 minutes of hesitation, the officials paused with a grim face to their vehicles and continued on the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male stripe, stayed behind, turning his white badge to remain anonymous.
Like their colleagues, the coordinators – men over 40 – play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we go verbally."
"But sometimes physically as well," explains Mr. Li soberly.
"Most of the time people start arguing."
Prosecutor will not charge Senator Ensign
Attorneys from the Department of Justice have freed Senator John Ensign from the charges that were raised against him following his case with a former electoral assistant and his attempt to provide her husband with a lobbying activity, the Senator’s lawyers announced on Wednesday.
This decision ends the heaviest lawsuit against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada. Until the scandal that led to headlines nationwide and shifted his career to a dampener, he was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012.
As Senator Ensign's office announced, he was "highly pleased" with the verdict after the one-year investigation.
However, the Senate Ethics Committee could impose a disciplinary penalty.
According to Ensign’s lawyers, they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign were terminated and there were no further charges in this matter.
The Justice Department did not want to comment on the case.
The verdict was a surprise for many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice, and in your opinion there was sufficient evidence that Ensign disregarded the lobbying ban.
Interviews, emails and other documents, first published in the New York Times in October 2009, gave cause to the suspicion that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his electoral assistants, was conspiring on lucrative assignments to silence him about an affair with Hampton's wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton worked as a treasurer during an election campaign.
Ensign contacted some political friends to provide Hampton work, and according to the documents and interviews, he took over for them after Hampton's lobbying.
Since Hampton was recently still on Ensign’s electoral team, he was not allowed to take on lobbying for his former employer or the entire Senate for a year.
According to ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, violated the so-called ban of the turn-door lobbying.
According to the published indices, "it seems to be a deal and a violation of the rotating door statutes," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer specializing in the defense of clients in the eyes of the government.
While the Ministry of Justice officially refused to disclose the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the Ministry seems very cautious in filing political accusations after a series of defeats, which were prosecuted by the media against the prosecution of the prosecution in the course of the year, the prosecution of the prosecution
Prosecutors are “obviously horrific,” said Melanie Sloan, the president of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics Association in Washington (an organization whose goal is to combat corruption in U.S. parliamentary and government circles), a group of lawyers who have filed a lawsuit against M.
"This basically means that senior government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, Chief Advocate of Mr Ensign, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a prosecutor on Monday and another on the following day, in which he was informed that the ministry would not file any complaints against his clients.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers had cooperated with the prosecutors to convince them that the senator, as his office repeated in a statement on Wednesday, had "acted in accordance with the law".
Mr. Coggins declined to explain in more detail the legal arguments he had presented to the prosecutors.
"I don't like to go into the details of the talks between the Department of Justice and me, just so much to say: we think we've made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to stop the investigations for a separate lawsuit by the ethics group after a <0x24>96,000 payment by Mr Ensign’s parents to the Hamptons violated the Federal Electoral Act.
The election commission said there was not enough evidence that the money was something other than a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada that for a long time supported the senator, was one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton found lobbyist work thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign.
An email from December 2008 proves that after the company continued Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's chief of staff, John Lopez, had an interview with Mr. Hampton in which he informed him that he was "attacked" at the interior ministry for a matter.
Mr. Ensign also met with Mr. Hampton and another client from Nevada, Allegiant Air, for lunch and asked the Minister of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after Mr. Hampton had suspended lobbying.
Last year, when information about these issues was first brought to the public, Mr. Ensign apologized to his voters and gave up his position in the Senate, where he had been fourth in the ranks of the Republicans.
After noticing him for many months, Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was seeking a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign will no longer be the target of police investigations, his spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hopes that the Ethics Commission will follow the example of the Ministry of Justice very quickly and stop its investigations.
“Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work at the service of the people of Nevada,” she said.
Cheshire Calls Attention on Twitter
Half a dozen of them slipped into the crows in the courtroom.
At the minute's notice, they sent their reports of gruesome witnesses via Twitter.
At the end, according to the defense, there were more than 140,000 tweets about the process of rape and chained children to beds in a house that was burning.
On Thursday, the attention-grabbing trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will find an official end when the judgement over the death sentence passed by the jury falls.
However, Mr Hayes’ lawyers have already filed applications in court, which provide grounds for appeal and which will employ the courts for years.
One of the most provocative reasons is that the intense reporting of the process - including the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - has led to a "circuss atmosphere" and a widespread, circumventing penetration of intrusive details, so that the jury has been distracted by the dismissal.
This objection could cause the Court of Appeal to consider whether the new technologies make new rules necessary in the Court of Justice.
“As I have experienced it during this process, I believe that it is really a danger if the introduction of new technologies in the courtroom affects everyone’s right to a fair trial,” said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes’ chief advocate.
The presidential judge, Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Court, rejected the requests by decision briefly last week when he said that the new media would be "meticulously checked" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passions.
But that was certainly not the last word in this matter.
For decades, court cases have found that reporting on famous-famous cases raises doubts about the fairness of a trial.
In his historic 1966 decision, the Supreme Court of the United States overturned the ruling against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopath from Cleveland who allegedly killed his wife, and said in his decision that due to the new media, there was a "carnival atmosphere" in the courtroom.
Some believe that the TV series and the movie "On the Escape" are based on this crime.
Some lawyers say court cases, which are considered to be Mr. Hayes’ conviction half a century later, could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to make the communication paths out of the courtroom, which were still unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard’s case.
"There is good reason to be concerned about the influence of the New Media in processes pursued by a broad public," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who has investigated the death penalty in Connecticut.
Professor Donohue said some appellate courts might be fascinated by the idea that restricting immediate communication from the courtroom could make the trials more fair.
The Twitter case is just one of many who present Mr. Hayes’ lawyers to discuss for years and thus postpone a conviction.
For example, the lawyers also claim that Mr. Hayes may have already been pre-condemned when Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them gruesome photo shoots during the jury selection.
Some of the jurors have said photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and their daughter-in-law, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, would have filled them with disgust.
Defendants say they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, and argue that the judge mistakenly exchanged a juror who was a critic of the prosecutor’s office, and that he unauthorizedly exercising pressure on the judgement, as if the judge did not believe it.
The jurors were not isolated.
However, their arguments about the influence of detailed reporting on the process may be of the greatest interest.
In a prosecution they filed last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed by the candidates during the election campaign for the governor’s office and for the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the New Media had continuously rekindled the flames of emotions over the case.
"A day-to-day harassment of media whistleblowers, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," the lawyers wrote, "has not yet been experienced in New Haven and perhaps not even nationwide."
Their focus on reporting via Twitter is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct messages are more invigorating than reports that will be refunded more slowly is a technically hostile view that impoverishes reporting on future processes.
However, some lawyers said that appeal courts would often face the argument, societal and technical changes required adaptation by the courts.
Mr Hayer's lawyers reinforce this claim.
In their objection, they referred to the Supreme Court’s decision of 1966, in which Dr. Sheppard’s conviction was repealed on account of reporting, and made it clear that the New Media required new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can courtesy connect the separating?
After a campaign of smuggling and negativity this week little courtesy broke out in Washington.
Is it the omen of genuine bilateral cooperation or a moment of illusion before you quickly return to the struggle of the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and the leaders of Congress did not bring a breakthrough in the big issues that one had to deal with during the so-called “lame duck session”, the meeting at the end of a government period in which no decisions are taken anymore.
According to all that you hear, it was not a polite discussion between two different sides or a respect for their shared responsibility, but rather an empty episode of a partial score.
The president’s public meeting on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences that continue to exist between the members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months creates mutual respect, which hides the ideological gap that continues to separate the members from each other.
This is hardly enough to claim that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in a test phase - in which one is called upon by the other to be willing to cooperate and compromise, while trying to balance the boundaries of public opinion and the patience of voters after a renewed party war.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of claims or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too great and too deep than one might expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that has prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it’s taxes, donations, health or care, the two sides are miles away from each other.
Finally, the November election in Washington has voted mild for at least a short time.
"No question, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration who is now working for the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
“This is unavoidable after elections.
Elections arouse partial passions that die again.
And that's good."
In some issues, especially those on the agenda of the lame duck session, Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution.
Bush’s tax cuts end at the end of the year, and no one supports it.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or all, whether it is temporary or permanent.
Similarly, a compromise on increased unemployment is to be expected, even if only because Republicans can’t afford to believe the favoured tax cuts for the rich while refusing support to unemployed workers.
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House, the optimism has increased that one can agree on these issues during the "lame duck session" and at the same time ratify the new START Treaty.
But William Glaston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on urgent issues of the lame duck session "does not necessarily lead to lasting cooperation of the parties when the new 112th Congress is convened in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of non-conformity is more likely, perhaps even inevitable.
“After the things that need to be done are done, this short-term psychology will be turned into confrontation,” he said.
Wehner is also skeptical – and this skepticism is shared by many – courtesy leads to true cooperation.
“I see a lot of things happening from today to 2012 as a pre-match, or shadow boxes, for the main event of 2012,” he said.
The reasons for this have a lot to do with the establishment of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the tea party voters who served their education.
Whatever the Republican leaders may be concerned about being too high on poker, they know they need to try to keep their promises to lower government spending and de-emphasize health reform.
These partisan lines are already clearly reflected in the first reactions on the recommendations of the Deficit Commission, which include tax reform and the lifting of some taxes, as well as raising the retirement age and lowering public spending.
Deputy chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own estimates, have pushed so hard to put the deficit issue on the public agenda that it can no longer be ignored.
But they need within the Commission 14 of the 18 votes to make their plan an official recommendation, and they are struggling hard to get even close to that number.
The greatest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the body, as in financial matters, at least today, there is little room for play or little sympathy for compromises.
Galston predicts two phases in the fight between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first fight will take place next year in the form of party clashes when Republicans challenge Obama with regard to the state budget, taxes and the health system, followed by a phase of greater bilateral cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
The public opinion.
It has been proven that, despite the partisanship of the current election, the majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together.
If confrontation leads to a backlash, as it happened in 1995, then both parties must pay close attention to the public response.
Whoever is condemned to lose will have to change the course and seek compromise.
In fact, this may be an optimistic viewpoint.
Partiality and polarization are greater today than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a bigger ideological gap between Obama and Congress Republicans than it was between President Bill Clinton and Republicans at the time.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a pure prelude to a much broader election in 2012.
In view of this, the courtesy that is being displayed this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
However, it will take a lot more effort on both sides to find a common denominator in the issues that still separate the two.
U.S. document portrays Moscow as a port of corruption
The control of the city lies in the hands of the "Kleptocracy" and it passes a portion of the bribe and protection money it collects to the Kremlin.
Both the police and the state security service are squeezing high protection funds so they can maintain their expensive standard of living in Moscow, it says.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal gangs.
Every layer of bureaucracy – what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called “vertical of authority” – takes its share of the money that the leaders are migrating upwards.
The memo, which was sent under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle to Washington, was published by WikiLeaks on his homepage on Tuesday.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still the mayor of Moscow, and it accused him of corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but there is hardly any evidence that he had been cleared in the meantime.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly rejected corruption charges over the years, and he has won numerous allegations against such charges.
In September, he told a Russian television station when he was asked for a documentary suggesting he was corrupt: “It’s crazy, it’s dirty, it’s dirty.”
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt. This has resulted in surveys.
But it is unusual that, as in the Ambassador’s report, individuals are mentioned, and it is unheard of that this is done by a diplomat of a foreign country.
“The direct connection of the Moscow government with crime has led some to call them ‘disturbed’ and conclude that the government is acting like a cleptocrat rather than a government,” the memo reads.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "kryshna" (a term from the world of criminals / the mafia, which literally means "roof" or protection), which extends through the police, the State Security (FSB), the Service Supervisory Authority (MVD) and the Office of the Prosecutor's Office as well.
Professionals have discovered a three-layer structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov stands Colonel Stell."
"FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second level."
"Ultimately, ordinary criminals and criminal inspectors are following at the lowest level."
"This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups close a gap in some areas because the city does not offer any help."
The report goes on to say that the FSB is cashing money from the largest companies and that the police are arresting small businessmen.
A source, he said, “declared that Moscow business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and FSB (and not from organized crime) because they not only have more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by law.”
“For this reason, protection by criminal gangs is no longer in demand as it used to be.”
The memo notes that while collecting funds is comprehensive, the protection itself is not very modest; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay find their business closed very quickly - due to one or the other pretext.
Medvedev has spoken several times about combating corruption, but at the same time noted that he has made little progress.
The memo of the message contains descriptions of men who go to the Kremlin with suitcases that were supposedly full of money.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats," said Georgi Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow expert commission, in an interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
“It is not part of the political class because a political class no longer exists in Russia.”
Without politicians, without opposition, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
nationwide, according to Indem, corruption costs Russia more than <0x24>300 billion a year.
The country ranks 154th in a recent survey on the global perception of corruption by the NGO Transparency International (countries are listed from "the least corrupt" to "most corrupt").
The revelation of the memo of the American embassy, which took place late in Moscow time, will certainly trigger failures within the Russian government, although since Luzhkov can be accused of Moscow's mistakes, it can also be a possibility for the Kremlin to claim that the problems can be solved.
In an interview with Larry King on CNN, Putin claimed that WikiLeaks documents could be a fake and reacted furiously to the revelation that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
“The truth is that it is about our interaction, which is an important factor of domestic policy in this country,” he said.
“But to be honest, we didn’t expect this to happen with such arrogance, with such pressure and in such an unethical way, you know.”
Khmer Rouge Veterans Forced to Face the Past
In a poorly illuminated, concrete classroom with dirty and slippery walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School recalls the man who built it, the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves ta mok."
"He was a good leader and he took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Due to his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as the "slaughterer", the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge-Hochburg in northwestern Cambodia, where he has built hospitals and bridges, developed the infrastructure, and where thousands of Soldamals live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge’s capitulation to the government, long-time supporters are challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum allowed the victims to public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a schoolbook that for the first time tells children of former soldiers the history of the Khmer Rouge.
And in July, a UN and Cambodian community court first condemned a former member of the Khmer Rouge when it condemned the former head of the famous Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as the Duke, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, fear grew among the Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs, hampering their efforts for reconciliation and reintegration into the society of Cambodia.
“There is still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything,” said Chhang Youk, head of Cambodia’s Documentation Centre, an independent organization investigating the regime.
"For her, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It divides families."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of illness, revision or hunger.
When the Vietnamese invaded and the Pol Pot-Ied government collapsed in 1979, the regime’s remnants and its military fled to the Cambodian border to Thailand.
Here they spread unrest until December 1998, when the last movement capitulated.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their base in the west of the mountains and jungle of Cambodia, Ta Mok moved the next generation to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country’s first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to move to government, leading to the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural death in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had not surrendered, was arrested in 1999 by government forces at the Dangrek Mountains.
He died in 2006 in Phnom Penh Prison, where he waited for his trial.
When their mercenaries no longer protected them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled to the devastating poverty of rural Cambodia and many retained the movement in nostalgic memory.
Although a few elite Khmer Rouge officials kept their local government posts because they laid down their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, untrained peasants.
“These people have benefited very little from capitulation,” said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are anchored in the regime's utopian agrarideology."
"They grew up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55 years old, who had joined the Rhmer Rouge in 1974, fought in the jungle for Anlang Veng before he settled in 1998 to lead a life as a poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok has given everyone something to eat."
“But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves.”
The ongoing Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raised concerns here.
At the beginning of next year, the court will try to bring Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, as well as Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, to trial.
The court’s mandate is to condemn the old leaders and those who are mainly responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether further acts will be pursued beyond these four cases.
This has little helped to alleviate the fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculations have focused on Im Chaem, 64, who during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s was the head of the district in Manteay Meanchey province.
In 2007, she told representatives of Cambodia’s Documentation Centre that she led the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project in which thousands of forced workers were presumably killed.
On a hot evening, Im Chaem returned from work on the fields to her wooden house on a dirty street outside Anlong Veng.
When the sun long shadowed the dirty grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss their past with the Khmer Rouge.
If the court asked her, she would refuse to go, she said.
"Cambodia lives in peace and stability," she said.
“If there were no more persecution, there would be war here.”
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would become uncertain, the court would charge more suspects, although experts and historians discuss this.
“Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past,” he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do to be able to move forward, said Chhang Youk from the documentation center.
"Reconciliation with the Khmer periods means bringing together the broken pieces," he said.
“It is our duty to put together these broken parts so that we can understand everything.”
The center created the first government-approved book on the Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia".
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an annex to the history book for the High School of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages about the Khmer Rouge.
As often in Cambodia, the young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city’s connections to the regime.
Touch Valeak, a 19-year-old student at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new school book helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents were skeptical when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They're suspicious because they're not sure how many people will be convicted by the court."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the schoolbook and the court are gradually gaining influence,” he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
Upstairs in the Dangrik Mountains, a path overlooked by bushes and dirty with plastic waste leads to a rectangle of black rust, covered with a rusty sheet roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned on a tyre hood after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a mobile phone vendor on the street, said she doesn’t know much about the man who was burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit, and many people come here to pray for him," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later in the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's last resting place, where she will lay a bush of ripe bananas - in hopes that he will bring her happiness.
Belarus agrees not to accumulate more armed uranium
In a surprise victory for President Obama’s campaign to secure global nuclear material, the Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement after a meeting of Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Summit.
The U.S. government had been trying for years to convince Belarus not to collect highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a hurdle last spring.
But U.S. government officials told the Washington Post that in the past two months, two secret agreements have been made with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of armed uranium from a Belarusian research institute.
This prepared the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material – according to an official who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the subject, about 500 pounds.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important results of Obama’s “Nuclear Security Summit of the 47 Nations” of April, which Belarus had ruled out.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
“I was really excited about the fact that they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit.”
“This proves to me that it works,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement "a very significant, important step" of Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
Dozens of countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama’s nuclear security summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko declared that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"How to retain highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally capable of weapons, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
"That's our raw material... We're not going to make dirty bombs out of it and we're not going to sell it to anyone."
"We use it exclusively for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus, however, approached the United States a few months ago when it expressed interest in reaching an agreement.
The first attempt to remove uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material was lightly irradiated, officials say.
It was loaded into a special train that is more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal, officials say.
The second flight was decided on Monday and was carried out by plane according to the officials.
The U.S. government is paying <0x24>14 million for these efforts, with much of the money flowing into Belarusian research with weakly enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
“This was extremely carefully coordinated and coordinated to build trust,” which led to the agreement that was signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Ministry of Energy working on Global Danger Reduction.
The James Martin Center for Non-Proliferative Studies estimates that Belarus this year had at least 88 pounds of armed uranium as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
According to the agreement, Belarus wants to dismantle its camp by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, primarily because of Lukashenko’s persistent disregard for human rights.
But the statement from Wednesday suggests a possible approximation.
“Welcome to the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus announce that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus is a central issue in the improvement of bilateral relations in Belarus,” he said.
No objections from the Spanish government to CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objections to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners over Spanish territory to Guantánamo, according to a telegram from the U.S. Ambassador in Madrid.
This reflects the documents disclosed by Wikileaks and transmitted to the daily newspaper "El País" (by cable), adding that former deputy head of government María Teresa Fernández de la Vega urged the Spanish government to be informed about the flight, "to be informed of the Spanish flight, to be informed of the need for Spain, to be informed of the
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe accusing aid for human rights abuses in a thousand countries, including Spain, former North American ambassadors Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega discussed.
The Deputy Head of Government admitted that the Council's report "has met Zapatero in the distance" and confirmed that Spain has nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no objections to the intelligence flights over Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" so as not to be "unpreparedly surprised," Aguirre said.
The former foreign minister, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel Moratinos, also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish government "doesn't want to pay much attention to this issue, although the government has little influence, as these are in the hands of judges."
Prosecutor Vicente González, for his part, gave the message in January 2007 that he would not block the judicial initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the Spanish Central Intelligence (CNI) and the Minister of Defence about the CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any burdensome or sensitive information," the ambassador said after an interview with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the US was concerned about “the apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors” rather than the declassified information of the CNI and the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to discreetly handle between governments," Aguirre complained.
At a lunch in March 2007, at which the U.S. Ambassador and Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba attended, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges are insanely concerned about their independence and are doing what they consider appropriate," he has given the Spaniel's comments to his employees to "show them appropriate."
The Ambassador also expressed concern about the PP’s approach in this matter.
"Despite their generally pro-American attitude, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt, from a hint that Zapatero's government's actions, which could be interpreted as potential human rights violations, could be tolerated or deliberately ignored, will hit capital, even if these disclosures are negative," he said.
The child-murderer admits that she complained on the Internet about the "mushsal" of motherhood.
The young woman spoke of the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in a Galician way"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is on the Internet "Muki".
Under this name, she keeps in touch with a cousin and at least a friend, both of whom come from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, where she was born.
The announcements are from 2008.
To understand these, one must know her love life, which the daily newspaper ABC reconstructs based on testimony from her family members.
The 30-year-old Galician began a relationship in 1998 with Iván Túñez, an industrialist.
She held a year.
Shortly after she had dissolved her relationship, it became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was from him, but his ex never let him perform a DNA analysis.
Shortly thereafter, she entered into another relationship.
The chosen was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighbouring community.
She lived with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look around on the labour market, the little one stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the contents of their messages, it can be concluded that their love relationship broke up and they separated.
In March 2008, she is on her own in Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very strange and bitter because I came to work."
“When I told him that, he liked it, but now of course he realizes what it means to be alone with the boy all day and not to be free to do and let him do what he wants.”
She later mentioned a message she just received on her phone: "I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send you the boy."
She complains, "If he doesn't like me leaving the boy with my mother, I'll pick him up when I get back."
In May, she said of returning to her village: "I'm going there this week, but I'm only going to stay there until the 19th because I have to introduce myself to a job on the 20th if I don't want to lose it."
She explains that she takes her first-born with her when everything goes well.
"He will be with whom he has to be, that is, with me. I will never leave him again in life with anyone except my mother," a dubious intention when considering their bad relationship.
There will be another mail in July.
When she writes this, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the 1st of the month and allegedly murdered on the 10th is dead.
"On the one hand, Caesar is satisfied, on the other hand, not."
“On the one hand, he’s with me and he likes the place a bit, but on the other hand, he has to go to school every day.”
She is talking about moving to Mallorca.
“There he [the boy] will go to a summer course, so I have less spending for the little girl.”
17: Memories and complaints.
"A giant kiss of Caesar asking me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos by e-mail. You see, if he wants, he finds me, like a mist."
On the 30th, one more: "The boy's fine. He's going to a summer class to learn Catalan."
Víctor, her current partner, has one: "He's shooting me money."
On the Internet, in anime and manga blogs, there are messages from her.
She even had her own blog in MySpace, which is now locked up, and in which she called herself "Muki, the jailer."
"Terror a la Gallega (Terror a la Gallega) ".
The last man who lived with her, a sworn hunter, declares to have conscience bites because he feels guilty.
He can’t understand that everything happened because she didn’t tell him she was a single mother.
Mónica was transferred yesterday from the centre for judicial prisoners in Menorca to the provincial prison in Palma.
Defendant Carlos Maceda said she could not recall the course of the matter, "and she did not intend to do little harm."
Before, however, she had confessed to drowning Caesar in the bathtub and hiding his body in a suitcase.
Defence and prosecution requested a psychiatric opinion.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in Congress and lost 9 PSC
With the results of November 28, the PP could play a decisive role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and MPs in the last regional elections, the PP is already focusing its attention on the parliamentary elections - whether they prefer it or not. Their expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes that this party achieves in these elections is usually twice as high as the votes in the kata.
For example, the Catalan People's Party received 610.473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while this figure was only 316,222 in the 2006 regional elections.
Last Sunday, the PPC scored 384,091 votes.
If this rising trend - the result of the redirecting of the PSC's share of votes and the binding of the PP's electorate - would stop, the analysts of the PP predict that in the parliamentary elections the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 members of Congress, while also CiU four (she has now 10) won 25 of the PSCs and won the 9.
These calculations demonstrate the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the People's Party's analysis, the ERC would lose one deputy - currently it has three - while the ICV could hold its deputy or win one.
However, if the electoral calendar is to be maintained, the next date will fall with the municipal elections in May 2011. Also then the People’s Party (PP) can be the language on the scale to prepare an end to socialist domination, namely in four provincial capitals, and with its majority in 2011: the city council with 6 municipalities in the city council of Barcelona, one in the Mills.
Both the Nationalists and the People’s Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the Socialists do not achieve a majority or can rely on their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
After the Republican debacle, it is undoubtedly that this party will lose its representation in the municipal council of Barcelona, where it would have to get 5% of the vote.
The PP, on the other hand, recorded an increase in its share of votes in the four provincial capitals and could become a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they could play the main role in Tarragona’s shift, where they had ruled together with the PP before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
En Lérida is only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, <0xC3><0x80>ngel Ros, has good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign they met several times.
Also in other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus, the People’s Party was able to see a significant increase.
Currently, the PP is represented in 34 municipalities in Catalonia and aims to create lists in as many places as possible.
Al Qaeda Cell Provides Thousands of Passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand.
The seven Pakistanis and Nigerians detained by police officers at the Barcelona Police Intelligence Service formed the jihadist cell controlled by Thailand, the various Al Qaeda groups, including the "Movement for the Liberation of Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and the "Laschkar e-Taiba" (Latsin) cars were in 2008.
The Spanish interior minister attaches great importance to these investigations, so far as he assures that with Operation Kampai, the counterfeiting apparatus of Al Qaeda has been “weakened” worldwide and “thus their ability to act”.
The researchers assume that in the two years in which the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were counterfeited, and then sent to the groups from which the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda was composed, so that their "fighters" could cripple through other euro-borders without penalties.
The detected cell is not the only one of the jihadist networks active in Europe. That is why other European police units have also been involved in the investigations in addition to the Thai investigative bodies. It is not to be excluded that it will be carried out in the EU as the service will be carried out in Barcelona in the coming days.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested) another one was carried out in Thailand, as well as the Baha'i Siri's Siri's Rehman and the Pakistani's Atha's Kiyak's.
They had led the cell from Bangkok to Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of it had been destroyed in 2009 - in particular, tourist passports in accordance with the requirements of the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents were issued on behalf of men aged 25 to 45 and had to be valid for several more years; they were not allowed to have a visa stamp.
Investigations have underlined that until now no connections could be established between those arrested in Catalonia and the bombing in Bombay, although the author of the assassination, "Laschkar e-Taiba", was one of the recipient groups of the trips stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it should be recalled that a few days before the assassination of Catalonia, several thousands of dollars had been sent from a money transfer company, which had been "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by the members of the "command" which was the end of the 10th.
The police have seized a large amount of documentation.
PP urges Mas to postpone tax agreement
The president of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took the opportunity yesterday to present Artur Mas personally their conditions to support his post as Prime Minister of the Generalitat. These do not differ from the financial positions already put forward during the election campaign, and can be subordinated to the regional position, the regional position and the unpreference of the economy.
The president of the Catalan People’s Party contacted Artur Mas with certainty, who gave her the 18 MEPs she had won last Sunday - a figure that is more than enough to feel indispensable. Because the candidate of the stistist position in the bourgeois-regionalist party is a member of the opposition party, the CiU is a member of the party.
The future alliances that the regionalists want to enter in the upcoming parliamentary elections depend on a possible agreement with the PP, but the talks that Mas currently holds with the rest of the party leaders are about Catalonia.
As for the party president of the PPC, she demands that "all discourses concerning the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" as well as an agreement on the financial balance between the State and the Autonomous Region - similar to those in the Basque Country - be made in support of the accession to the office - and those of the CiUwerchef Party.
Both political leaders have a common belief that they want to slimen up the regional government’s political apparatus and abolish inheritance and gift taxes.
Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat are involved in the details of the negotiations on the accession of Mas.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a fierce opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV) - today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The nursing home confirms that the deaths are not due to "missing measures"
The owners of the Old Home in Olot do not rule out the fact that their caregiver killed more than eleven older people
The officials of the La Caritat nursing home in Olot (Gerona) yesterday gave a press conference in which they outlined the damage to the criminal acts Joan Vila Dilmés - the nurse who killed at least eleven old people for whom he was responsible - to the one direction.
The head of the nursing home, Joan Sala, joined the court with his lawyer, Joan Cañada, and announced, "La Caritat wants to accuse the person responsible for the deaths", but "the right and our liability compel us to take on the process and civil law."
The institution must not only accept a loss of social standing because it had not detected the criminal acts of the caregiver in time, but now also pay a high amount of compensation, which is calculated by the legal representatives of the families of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that he has continued to murder since then.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies—ex-patients of the nursing home—as he suspected that no doctor had personally examined the deceased, but the formalities due to their age and illnesses were resolved by telephone.
The head of La Caritat denied this point around, stating that "the remaining measures could never have been the reason for the incidents."
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "there is no evidence in the legal dispute of negligent acts of any person other than the accused."
The already baptized "Death Angel" confessed to 11 murders yesterday, declaring that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009, and having murdered the second old lady a month and a half later.
In this case, he killed with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime in which he had given a mixture of various sedatives.
The head of La Caritat said the staff's access to the drugs was difficult to control.
The insulin injections and the sedative cocktail were used by the nurse in six out of nine crimes committed to free the patients with death from their suffering.
But the results of the laboratory examinations will reveal whether Vila is lying and actually chose a less cruel death for his first victims, or whether he burned them out from the inside by giving them bleaching, as he had confessed to three women he had done between the 17th and the 12th of October.
In La Caritat, there is no faith in the statements made by the caretaker, not even in terms of the number of murders committed, which could be quite more. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements before the court and that it does not make sense to change his procedures according to the procedure.
They say they made themselves available to the judiciary for this reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents.
Threat boards of the European Central Bank (ECB)
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to the threat posed by ECB President Trichet, who warned that “the markets should not underestimate our ability to react.”
The risk impacts of the euro-peripheral countries have increased dramatically and the shares of European banks have increased by more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB may be wrong and that the euro has barely added points, which is a cause for concern.
The events of yesterday are typical of an illiquid market that recovers to the extent that it collapses again, but as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose his fear for a long time.
Today, a month ago, the European Central Bank urged us to withdraw our liquidity measures, according to which the ECB will have to make a withdrawal tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably several more times in the future.
The Federal Bank called for the termination of the plan for the purchase of government debts as they are ineffective, as well as the repeal of all exceptional, fixed-term liquidity measures, which should only be maintained for one week indefinite access.
Following the Irish crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended "at least until March" and the quarterly tenders with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity will be maintained until at least June.
We also expect the program to continue to buy bonds and to send out a stronger signal.
If the created expectations are not met, the excellent response of the markets from yesterday will be thrown back again, and if it is insistent that we take back our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
As at the ECB’s meeting in May, when the bank confirmed that it did not consider the purchase of government bonds and the markets subsequently collapsed, this story could repeat itself tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May, she showed her teeth and on Wednesday, she said she had already bought a lot, causing a new market collapse.
Yesterday, the auction of one-year state titles in Portugal was quite weak.
The State Assets Administration issued only 500 million to 5.28%, compared with 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basis points throughout the curve and thus reflected a change in market perception according to Trichet’s words.
In Ireland, the figures for the debt gap were published by Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The sum is estimated at approximately 10,000 million in the short term and a possible additional 15,000. There is time until February to acquire private capital or these banks will be nationalised.
Although Ireland has completely lost its credibility after it did not recognize the problem with the stress tests in July, the figures under the rescue plan are acceptable and help reduce uncertainty.
However, the government must obtain parliamentary approval for its new budget next Tuesday, and since it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland remains a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated her speech with regard to the summit of the Heads of State and Government on 14 December, where political unity is required to show that we are playing the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries want to play Beethoven’s ninth symphony.
The Spanish Prime Minister presented yesterday the action plan to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions such as financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalisation, privatisation and labour acquisition measures. Measures that sound to investors like Vivaldis Four seasons.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock exchange has closed by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Compared to February, the reaction of the government and the Spanish central bank was quick and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today there is a crucial auction of a three-year government bond that will benefit from the trichet effect, which is why we are relying on a strong demand that will eliminate all doubts about our ability to convert debt.
For Spain, the application for an aid plan would be a self-sacrifice.
We would get liquidity that we don’t need. The Treasury has 40 billion euros available, three times as much as in March. The interest rates are too expensive and access to the markets would be closed on time.
Nevertheless, our strategy should correspond to Caesar’s wife’s motto: “Now counts not only being, but also appearance.”
Only courage, we can do it!
At the request of his children, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Eulen invites the Society of Vega Sicilia
The storm in the open conflict of the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family, owners of the companies Eulen and El Enebro, does not fade away.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, founder of the company, will fight the company meeting of El Enebro, which will be held at the request of five of his seven children on the 16th, because he considers them "absolutely null". His children will try to get a majority - to control the management bodies of the company.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez and his children Jesus David and María José are preparing the legal measures for a new chapter in their dispute over control of a part of the company group.
The founder of the largest holding company does not appear to be willing to give up control of the bodies of El Enebro in his legal dispute.
He was expelled from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children, who were appointed members of the Board of Directors at the Shareholders’ Meeting of 18 January this year, which is already registered as contested in the Trade Register.
The company assembly of El Enebro, which was convened by the judge of the Commercial Court No. 2 of Madrid for the 16th, has triggered a new strike in the wake of the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family.
The call of the judge to convene the assembly is the only legal way to ensure the convening of the assembly of societal persons.
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira <0xC3><0x81>lvarez Mezquiriz is interpreted by David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez as a "desperate means of the applicants - his five children - to explain, by means of legal tip-offs, fraudulent machinations and legal abuses, the dismissal of the 18th of January.
This argument is the basis for the subsequent appeal of the assembly to declare it "absolutely void".
The same protagonists, who were in discreet silence, tried unsuccessfully in June to summon a meeting on a judicial basis.
At El Enebro, asset company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez' seven children control 100 percent of the capital.
On the other hand, according to family protocols, the founder of the service group demands the right to use more than 51% of the capital.
This is the actual background of the matter on which the judge has to decide in the hearing on the proceedings for which no date has yet been fixed.
Red Bull wins in F1 with a Siemens secret weapon
The cars are improved with real-time software.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history has been marked in this world of speed of surprises and success.
At first, no one paid attention to the newcomer and despite his steep rise during the last seasons, at the final track last November, everyone put on the victory of Ferrari by Fernando Alonso.
Without wanting to downplay the abilities of German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power of Renault’s engine, the “secret weapon” that the Multi Siemens Red Bull put in its hands, and thus created a winning team, has become a legend.
In reality, it is a powerful software for simulating processes that the German company launched in 2007 for purposes that are not related to car races.
This computer science program, known as PLM, has been used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, power plants and high-precision instruments.
A faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process is intended before it is actually built in order to avoid errors and unnecessary costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft and Nissan’s most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens’ industry department, explains that the use of this software in Formula 1 – Red Bull factory can design and execute “in a few hours, almost in real time” the changes and improvements that can be detected on the race and during the tests.
In 1992, Russwurm found an average of ten technicians working in the races, who were able to make up to three or four improvements in a season.
Today, the Red Bulls team employs 180 highly qualified young people, and with powerful EDV systems, they carry out analysis and all kinds of changes to the race car.
The Siemens manager explained that the PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all components of Red Bull’s racing cars, with the exception of the engine for which Renault is solely responsible.
The materials, the fuel, the aerodynamics and the safety elements are being changed.
Thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclaves, the changes can be transferred to reality within less than 24 hours from the virtual reality of the simulator.
The only limit set for this crazy technical perfectionism is the <0x24>40 million a Formula 1 team can spend on their races in a season.
Red Bull has built its high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of its racing cars in a location 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings in which visits - especially by journalists - are very limited.
Everything that happens there is top secret.
The crew comprises 580 people, including the two pilots, World Champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull's true Formula 1 hero is undoubtedly the latest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources that the energy drink manufacturer puts into the services of its participation on the race tracks, other protagonists, whose support is invaluable and their fame is equal to zero.
Steve Nevey, the factory’s chief technology officer, said five years ago that the advances in R&D for racing cars contributed 50 percent to the victory and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today, the share values have changed. The technology accounts for 85 percent of the success, while the contribution of the pilots is estimated to be 15 percent.
Nevey admits that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by EDV because they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP will open its own stores with local dealers in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugurated its first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with its partner Ront Reyes.
It is the first of a sales network consisting of twenty stores with 80 to 100 square meters each, which Multi intends to open in Spain in the next two years.
The company agrees on this initiative with the existing 16 multi-brand sales areas, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
HP Spain’s deputy chairwoman, Helena Herrero, named the rebuilt store on the Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which HP has been working for thirty years.
The North American Group intends to establish 200 sales offices in Europe by 2010, of which 20 are located in Spain.
The first ones were inaugurated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third store.
Herrera did not want to betray the upcoming re-openings, but did not rule out that Madrid could be the next target.
The deputy chairman, who is also the head of HP Personal Systems, ensured that the philosophy of opening the store is always the same. She relies on a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American group of companies advises them and takes over the exclusive shop equipment (with interactive touch products). In Europe, all stores will look the same.
In addition, HP is responsible for training the shop staff.
Helena Herrero said it was not a franchising system and highlighted that with the exclusive sales point network, "the aim is to optimize the customer service and the advice of small and medium-sized companies when buying and after, if not even the packaging."
The store in Barcelona has a pioneering pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with warranty.
An online service builds a connection to the technical centre in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"This way we can solve problems in ten minutes that sometimes take up to two days."
"This system has been developed especially for small and medium-sized enterprises as well as private customers, as the large enterprises already have their service contracts for technical customer service," Helena Herroro said yesterday.
Sabadell wants to steal one million customers from rivals in three years
Banco Sabadell’s CEO, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers, who believes that 2001 will be a tough year for the banks, but at first a new liquidity crisis and the end of the debt war is predicted.
Nevertheless, he anticipates a break in interest rates that the banks are trying to compensate for with increases in fees and borrowing prices.
Sabadell expects to capture one million private customers in three years - a subject that still exists.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years, and thus to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will introduce a new three-year plan in 2011.
The goal is not only to survive without taking advantage of the public aid from the FROB, but also to increase the market share of one million private customers - 700 000, if you deduct the customers that the bank will lose - which is the biggest challenge that the bank has now faced as private.
This year it has reached 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share for private customers is 3.5 percent, while business customers account for more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is to increase productivity, i.e. austerity, cost reduction. The challenges faced by the bank will be presented together with the annual report.
Few banks dare to set and publish targets in these difficult times, as the global financial crisis has disrupted all banks’ plans.
This year, Sabadell will complete its Optima Guideline, which was originally designed for three years, but it was extended by one business year as a result of the market situation.
The customers who leave the savings banks are the main target of the bank.
At a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola emphasized, 2011 would be a "difficult" year "with great reach".
The manager assumes that Spain is only “slowly” out of the crisis.
In addition, it would be "very difficult" to "create work" in two or three years - fundamental to the survival of banks.
Even if he assumes that the war on liabilities - which punishes interest margins - is going to float, the risk gains that banks and savings banks have to pay for their emissions to maintain liquidity are already downgraded to the price of loans as a compensation for fluctuating profit margins.
"The issues of liquidity and financing are structural and they will exert pressure on the loans."
"We didn't turn the chicken away, but the interest differentials are very high," Guardiola added.
Banesto already issued the order on Thursday to its branch network to restrict the provision of long-term loans and increase the interest differentials (see Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also admitted that the banks were currently pursuing the rule of law to "increase the fees", but "within a framework shaped by competition".
Sabadell’s plan is based on organic growth, even if the group, as always, does not exclude corporate businesses.
Not for nothing, he assures that in Spain "larger companies are needed."
“Next year, everything will change,” he said.
He stresses that the need for capital is currently "growing enormously" and does not exclude that some Spanish financial institutions will slip into red figures.
He is of the opinion that FROB could replace the money market in the case of capitol stockpiles.
After ensuring that Sabadell could also survive a temporary closure of the markets, he disproves the argument of some bankers who are already prophesying a new liquidity crisis.
He stresses that nothing can be put into circulation, but unlike the incidents in June, short-term funding can be achieved through repo transactions and thereby stop the crisis.
CECA excludes a second fusión shaft of the savings banks
The Director General of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, denied yesterday the possibility of a merger of the savings banks and stressed the speed with which the industry will be restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish savings banks began, several savings banks insisted not to participate in the first phase.
On the other hand, the Director General of the Spanish Association of Sparkassen (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers have been completed. Cajasol's inclusion in the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered a second round, but rather an adjustment."
"The majority is finished. It may be that instead of seventeen we have thirteen or fourteen, but all the important processes are already completed. They have been controlled by Banco de España, who has strongly supported all the processes."
At a breakfast organized by the Association of Managing Directors and Managers of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta concluded that the concentration process "was carried out as soon as possible and that we must be satisfied with the timely expiry, which was in earlier times, not now fixed, as part of the business banco.
"The transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28,000 million assets to 17 with 75,500 million each is a historically unparalleled process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger than what we have achieved with the Basel agreement," he said.
Olavarrieta explained that "there would be a series of unbroken opinions on the slowness of the process, the dissatisfaction and nonsense" as "Banco de España warns us to close just before the end of the year."
The Director General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday assured that Spain has one of the most rigorous financing systems in Europe and "perhaps" around the world, and added that those who doubted doing so "without deeper knowledge".
The manager noted that in the current economic downturn we need to "do not worry" about the situation of the financial institutions and the savings banks that have undergone a "very significant" concentration process that will be implemented "as soon as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had very well undergone the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the Red Line of Germany
Berlin has chosen to keep the euro, but at the same time has set conditions for the entire European Union.
The tensions in the markets have triggered a dual response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has presented new adaptation measures, starting with tax reductions for small and medium-sized enterprises, the regulation of time-employed enterprises or the lifting of 426 euros of support for unemployed persons who do not receive state unemployment benefits, up to 30 lottery fees and the privatisation of the Abarajas.
On the other hand, Deputy Head of Government, Elena Salgado, with the help of former Prime Minister Felipe González, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible for the current crisis.
How are these processes to be understood?
It is assumed that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her public service.
On the contrary, this is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
In doing so, Germany adopts a fundamentally new perspective on shaping our future, which conflicts with the preservation of the old-fashioned traditions of most of its partners.
Given the resistance in Europe, Germany is beginning to speculate on three possible ways to get out of the crisis.
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the South had to leave the euro area.
The second: The reintroduction of the German mark – although it is now more like Science Fiction – is supported by a majority of public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
The third is a restructuring of the euro in accordance with German proposals. This means: more macroeconomic control; strict budgetary management; penalisation of countries that exceed the requirements; possibly the payment of some countries, as well as the extension of the costs of potential adjustment measures to private sectors.
The German position is unambiguous and has been distinguished for some time, so there are no excuses now.
First, in 2009, both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits and the German government withdrew a constitutional reform to prevent this from 2016.
This was the first sign of a conflict between what Germany deemed necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign put the Central European country, when Merkel painfully pushed out the decision to save Greece.
At the time, this was heavily criticized, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the public opinion were absolutely against a rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel is re-emerging with a clear position, calling for a reform of the European Union agreements to allow the rescue of a country, while at the same time obliged private lenders to bear part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European as it drives the Irish crisis and everything else.
But their proposal, although somewhat sweetened, has been adopted, and in the coming months we will be participating in the reform of the European Union, which is to enable these measures from 2013 onwards.
Germany has drawn a red line that is not meant to be crossed.
It tells everyone that - even if unpopular measures need to be taken now - the old way of functioning of the euro will no longer exist from this date.
2013 will be the birth year of a new monetary area, in which counter-trading countries can be severely punished, forced to declare themselves insolvent and, in this case, the private sector must take part of the costs.
Germany shows us that we need to hit a hard pace of growth, with high savings and investment rates, moderate consumption, improved productivity and competitiveness, and positive external economic balances.
The other alternative, based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as indicated by Spain in boom times, will simply not be accepted.
The offer is clear.
And we would do bad to not understand it.
It is not just about lowering the government deficit to 3% by 2013.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is cheating on ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will be more calm.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities offered to us by the spring of 2013.
It seems that Zapatero has understood that, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the big companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures from yesterday) indicates that despite the criticism of Merkel, she has the hypothesis of creating order in her own home.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it doesn’t look like it would change anything.
Among the possibilities envisaged is that we should not exclude the euro area, which is completely blocked by less-reliable countries.
In this case, Germany could still tell us it warned us.
Sport and Regulations
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show the spirit of invention, but not the will to bypass a sanction.
The alleged exclusion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the November 23 game against the Ajax in the Champions League led to a lot of ink being spilled about whether it was a non-sports action or not and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is commonly known, the two players lost a few minutes before the end of the game (their team had already clearly won) time and played several fouls so that the referee showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid would lead his group, the two players will meet the prescribed penalty in the next league match against Auxerre and thus enter the next game without cards.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee penalised the club's coach, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more likely to occur in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten but followed rules in this sport.
Part of the debate about the case presented is that a team of Real Madrid football club (who in his anthem pretended to be noble and honour and had punished his players on other occasions for similar incidents) played the main role, provoking as the protagonist, and on the dramatization of the story by a more epic of the Mourinho.
In any case, the debate is about whether this is not explicitly contrary to the principles of sport prohibited by the statutes, that is, whether these acts constitute a violation of the rules. In fact, this approach adheres to the statutes of the sport, but seems to be inconsistent with its meaning.
In this case, the damage caused to the sporting spirit should be investigated.
The sporting spirit defends the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that was not endangered by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid the opposing players taking an unjustified benefit from the opposing team.
The paradox of Real Madrid players’ actions is that they do not correspond to what we normally understand by misplay or rule-making, because circumvention of the rule was not secretly carried out in order to avoid a penalty, but it should be as noticeable as possible so that it is punished by the referee.
The players waited and took the penalty with pleasure.
Another question is what kind of advantage the infringers drew from the intentional fouls.
It should be pointed out here that the rival has not been placed in an unfavorable position, nor have the advantages for the game played, since the obvious result of this action was that his own team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club then does not have these players.
The advantage is obviously that players start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But this is a long-term, up to a certain degree, uncertain advantage, as the team could at some point eliminate as well. In addition, players with this procedure receive a penalty and go into the second card cycle, in which they accumulate cards with a card less than in the first cycle.
It is not clear if this is really an advantage.
Ultimately, such approaches are not directed against the sporting spirit, which also includes strategic decisions to make the most of the rules.
In this case, the players did not want to circumvent a sanction (this would actually be a clear case of regulatory breach), they wanted to choose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without escaping or escaping from a punishment.
Although the boundary between giving of the invention and the regulatory environment is obscured, I believe that this is a clear case of giving of the invention.
I have the impression that the polemics arose due to two factors: because there were two self-exclusions and because of the nature of the provocated rule transfer.
The damage that these actions have caused to the principles of sport is less ethical than aesthetic.
Dealing Offensive to Catch Customers for Group Christmas Dinner in Barcelona
The Dictatorship of the Calendar this year drops a labyrinth of reservations to the days of 16 and 17 December.
The celebrations paid by employees themselves are widening. They do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turrón and the Christmas lottery, there are also group dinners in the pre-Christmas season, which provide oxygen to Barcelona’s restaurant and leisure business. But as a result of the economic crisis, they are triggering a price offensive, to also capture the customer’s segment, which represents the large mass, or can catch up to all the 30 days between:
To make the accounting a bit more complicated, the calendar (silver falls on a Friday) has dropped all orders into the week of December 13, resulting in a labyrinth of reservations of dinners on two peak days (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders in the week ahead.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have been hiring group dinners for budget reasons.
In order not to have to abandon this tradition, many workers pay for it from their own pocket.
Whatever the situation, low prices are being demanded, confirms the chairman of Barcelona’s board of directors, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the Dachverband has so far not dared to predict what the holidays will look like this month.
"People think about it 'twenty times before they book."
"They like to go out, but they pay close attention to the prices," he stressed.
The store will go well with those who "offer the quality at good prices with a good service", he adds, reminding us that customers save in times of crisis, which is why prices are asked for 25 euros the most.
In a survey in several centrally located restaurants, it turns out that the evening of December 17th the providers will collapse.
The Soteras Group says the demand for this Friday with the intention of spending less than 30 euros would boom. The group has adapted their menus with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
With another leading group, Andilana, which has 16 guesthouses in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), has led the ownership of the calendar to pre-reservations, even from the beginning of November.
“We made the impossible possible to maintain the previous year’s prices with menus for every taste from 19.95 to 30 euros,” he explains.
At AN Group, which manages El Mustol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 venues, one does not lose optimism after the second quarter has blossomed revenues and good, although focused outlook for the Christmas business for a few days.
Sources of the company group point out that the 18th will also be an overactive day with friends groups celebrating Christmas.
A Christmas menu for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 or more has been added to the six group menus, with the impression that customers are willing to spend 10% more than the previous year and in return want more details, such as Cava.
Some companies also see green sprouts sprouting, which is why the employees are invited again. This gives the impression that the group pensions are on the rise again.
From the sides of the Fecasarm rooftop association (with mergers such as the bar, restaurant and leisure association of Barcelona), the deputy chairman, Enric Gomà, is confident to see the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations are overall quite "lively" although the customers are "exciting".
However, the fun at the celebration did not decrease, no matter who pays.
Pakistan’s nuclear program raises great concern in the US
Islamabad is producing nuclear weapons “quicker than any other country.”
Wikileaks’ revelations confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department revealed by the Wikileaks Internet portal confirms the enormous concerns posed by the Pakistani nuclear program Washington.
On the edge of the clarifying and juicy details that the documents on the contents of the talks and the mindset of accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad offer, these reveal that cooperation between the two countries in matters of nuclear security is not rapidly enhancing as Waffenese's other country, but rather "reduces the atobilets" and "reduces the asia.
In particular, the peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear program - that the weapons are not composed, but their items are stored in order to make their destruction more difficult in a possible attack - prepare Washington for sleepless nights.
The following risks include the ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report ahead of the visit of former National Security Council leader James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the area attacked by the Taliban, the presumed dispersion of nuclear material and the vulnerability of nuclear material to transport".
The large number of people involved in the nuclear arsenals and the missile programs will no longer be seen not only by the United States, but also by Russia as outgoing and reason to be cautious.
"Pakistan needs to hire highly credible personnel to monitor the nuclear facilities; because of the low level of education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who are involved in nuclear or missile programs," Yuri Korolev, an expert at the Russian Foreign Ministry, said in a statement.
The new documentation revealed by Julian Assange’s Internet portal is that U.S.-Pakistan cooperation in nuclear proliferation is decreasing and the pace at which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May, an embassy office describing communications with Pakistan as "frustrant" declared: "There is often no transparency; we do not receive any responses to aid offers or they are rejected."
In another statement, Peter Lavoy, an official of the State Intelligence Service for South Asia, confirmed that "despite the economic disaster Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons as quickly as no other country."
Ambassador Patterson asked Washington during a visit of the chief army commander, General Ashfaq Kayani, to "clarify" the responsible that "Pakistan's army must stop its silent support of terrorist groups."
Hunting for Wikileaks boss
Obama appoints a senior anti-terrorist fighter to prevent new disclosures.
Interpol issued a red warning for the pursuit and discovery of Assange.
Everything related to WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth in which the facts are difficult to clarify.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a "red warning" about Assange's "discovery and persecution".
However, this is not a traditional arrest arrangement.
It is not new, it dates from November 20th.
It also has nothing to do with the latest disclosure of over four million US diplomatic documents, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian must face in Sweden.
In addition, WikiLeaks founder Mark Stephens' lawyer assures, "the police would know where and how they could contact Mr. Assange."
Already on 20th, the international police authority based in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but it was not announced by the Swedish authorities until yesterday after receiving the power.
The 188 Interpol countries are tasked with identifying and finding Assange, "in order to temporarily arrest and extradite him."
Although Interpol cannot arrange for the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, many member states consider the red warning to be a free letter for an arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - especially if it is concerned about a bilateral syllabus and is concerned with the case of expulsion from England.
The move angered Assange’s lawyers, who released a letter informing them that the 39-year-old founder of WikiLeaks is ready to answer questions from the Swedish authorities via videoconferencing.
They also recall that Assange applied for the exit from Sweden and was compared by the prosecutor, who was told by Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, the head of security of Stalin, who received the corresponding approval.
“It’s like a hunt, not a legal pursuit,” the letter said.
As the world seeks him – and his mother from Australia pleads guilty to her son’s innocence – Assange stays in an unknown place, but does not remain silent.
On Monday, he interviewed the head of Time magazine via Skype from an indefinite location and asked for the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be proved that she was responsible for the order of North American diplomats to spy on the UN and thus violate international agreements signed by the United States, she would have to resign," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, who called the request for resignation " ridiculous and absurd".
“I’m not sure why we should value the opinion of a guy with a website,” he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a senior anti-terrorist fighter, Rusell Travers, to prevent new document disclosures.
President Barack Obama’s attempt to pay less attention to Assange is contrary to the views that conservative politicians and commentators have expressed these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will preside over the National Security Committee of the House of Representatives from January, has called on the State Department to investigate the possibility of placing WikiLeaks on the list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate their funds and to provide support to anyone who is prosecuting or lending them."
Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone even further, and he had to revoke his statement that Assange had to be "assassinated".
“Obama would have to turn it into a target and use an unmanned plane or something.”
Those who did not apologize were Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas, and a possible presidential candidate.
“Anyone who lets information in the government is guilty of treason and all that is not execution is one too mild punishment,” he told Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC with a blind eye to the Carod
The Republican leader allows the party to hold a secret vote on its continued presence in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the Plenary Principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe to get out of the way for the zigzag of an internal upheaval in the ranks of the undirected ERC after the loss of 11 MPs and half of the votes.
The party chairman is aware that his threat of resignation is not enough for the kinsman of the former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector is now as weak as its mentor himself, and he will not suffer the same headaches as others.
That’s why Esquerra’s leader tries to win the new critics with a blind eye, which would secure his position until the next municipal elections.
For the start, yesterday announced that the more than 200 regional council members of ERC could secretly comment on its stay in office.
With ballots, not with a high hand.
If the cardinals wanted to miss a criminal record for the president, they could do so without having to fear repression.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of division and the impression of submission among his person.
In several interviews, he confirmed that he would feel unconfirmed with half of the votes plus one, and he added without specifying percentages, a result "in the Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
The Carod relatives call on the president to make his office available more than just to the party, an insufficient gesture since Puigcercós controls the supreme organ of Congress.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will agree with the Board of Directors on an action plan from now until May.
To this end, they expect to be able to participate in the drafting of the Strategic Reorientation Document that the Management will submit to the Council for a vote on the 18th.
Its intention is to pay tribute to Puigcercós, who, in return, is to promise to present Congress in the autumn of 2011, which the party leader already considers a fact.
The party chairman of the ERC is of the opinion that the "polyphony" damages stability and he strives once and for all to enable the organization to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article signed by current counsel Josep Huguet in his blog is symptomatic.
Given the fact that Puigcercós is an ideologist, the owner of Innovation considered it a fact that the party chairman is supported "in exchange for different goals".
He counted five of them, two of whom are at the forefront.
First, the "restructuring" of the board so that it represents at least 90 percent of the party members, that is, the inclusion of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second might be the big news.
Huguet proposes that the ERC finally abandon the principle of assembly as a way of functioning.
In this way, he is fighting for a reform of the statutes that will allow congresses to be held with elected delegates.
From the end of the assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system - Puigcercós' team, who already fought for it at the last two congresses, is as obsessed.
In fact, at the 2008 Incumbent Assembly, the party leadership was commissioned to revise the Plenary Assembly Principle at a congress to deal with the reform of the Statutes.
This deadline is still pending, as the internal turmoil of recent years did not suggest addressing this issue.
Now, without the critical sectors on the brink, the time might have come to re-establish and end this matter forever.

Next to him, the police found a notebook with a message.
China maintains its greenhouse gas reduction targets
China’s representative at COP16 said its country has made enormous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and it would maintain its offer to reduce 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China will keep its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, the country’s representative at COP16.
At his first public appearance at the 16th United Nations Climate Summit (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and transform its industry.
He stated that over the past four years his country has invested <0x24>245 million to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
On the contrary, he stated that China would not change its goals, but would work together with the international community on this issue.
He explained that China’s climate change strategy is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institution building, and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been made in all aspects, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which included the targets for reducing gas emissions, he said.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, the federal authorities had worked with those of the central state and the municipalities to achieve the goals of energy saving, energy efficient use and emission reduction.
In addition, he said, some multi-annual plans have already been attacked or completed, both those funded by the Chinese government and those that received funds from other countries.
For example, he referred to the Energy Efficient Use Program, which was introduced in the last five years and had received investments from the United Nations (UNO), the government, and from private hands.
There is also a project at the provincial level for climate change, another for the exchange of traditional bulbs by energy-saving bulbs and another for the mitigation and adaptation, he explained.
Martin Krol, the country’s scientific government advisor on climate change, confirmed that China’s efforts are far greater than would be generally accepted.
He pointed out that the per capita emission of greenhouse gases in China was six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons. China is responsible for a total of nine percent contribution to environmental pollution.
It is also making unprecedented progress in the field of energy use. Energy efficiency has increased by twenty percent in the last five years and a further increase is expected by 2020, he said.
Legal exclusion Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN stated that the former panist party chairman has the right to appeal to the National Ordinance Commission and to demand what the right conferred on him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was to the right and that the former party president of the PAN has the right to turn to the National Regulatory Commission and demand what the right grants him.
In an interview held prior to the complaint, Gabino Cué Monteagudos as governor of the state, he said the exclusion of Espinos was a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an independent decision of the regulatory commission in Sonora."
"Mr. Espino has the right, in his case, to appeal to the Comisión de Ordens del Consejo Nacional, so that a decision is made by a competent body," he added.
On the other hand, he explained that it was not time to think about 2012 and that an alliance for presidential candidates had never sat at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional emerged stronger from the internal vote on 4 and 5 December, when his successor was elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is a topic that has never been on the negotiating table, at least not so far. It was a proposal for municipal elections, it was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he said.
The panic leader explained that the PAN is looking back on 71 years of dialogue, so “internal competition does not frighten us; on the contrary, “we enjoy it and it strengthens us,” he commented.
He said that the Council would undoubtedly choose the or the best president that Acción Nacional will need for the next three years, so he would pass the staff "to the one that the Council would determine."
"I'm completely unconcerned and open, and I would be proud to transfer the office of party chairman to each of the five."
He predicted that the party's rise recorded in the last July 4 election would be reflected in the next election, although "it's not time to think about 2012."
"Now it's about supporting Governor Gabino Cué in his task."
In this context, he pointed out that the three governments, which emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa, would bear the flag and be observed throughout the country. Therefore, "many hopes and aspirations are placed in them and I am sure that Gabino is at the height of the demands."
When asked about the criticism of the PRI of President Felipe Calderón for his speech during his four-year government, César Nava called on the supporters of the PRI to reflect on the six-year period of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should start defending them, they should finally come out of the closet," he said.
He is of the opinion that the owner of the federal government can make expressions like those he can make in his speech at the Auditorio Nacional, because in this country there would be no oral prohibition and less censorship.
Obama is on Twitter for the Law for Undocumented Students
“If you’re in favor of enacting the Dream Act, then call on your senators and urge the enactment of this law,” the president tweeted in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported nationwide mobilization to support the Dream Act – the Law to Legalize Undocumented Students with a message on his personal blog on Twitter.
“If you’re in favor of enacting the Dream Act, then call on your senators and urge the enactment of this law,” Obama tweeted.
His brief announcement contains a cyberlink to a more extensive document that calls on the public to contact their senators in conjunction with the bill, as the vote on the law is immediately ahead.
"With your voice we're waiting for, the time has come to listen to you," he stressed.
The news was circulated after the 42 Republican senators were reluctant to block all votes for any law, except the expansion of tax cuts from the Bush era and the government's funding would be expanded.
Such a blockade, announced on a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could have an impact on the approval of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the blocking of Republicans of the Dream Act and other projects, Presidential Speaker Robert Gibbs said he was confident that once the tax issue is resolved, a schedule for the other projects could be drawn up.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that the tax issue must be settled before the end of the year..."
"I believe that we can reach an agreement on this at any time and then we can plan the rest," he said.
The president of the Democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he would "request the vote at the end of the debate" so that the Dream Act - a law with which the initiative to legalize undocumented students will be voted on Thursday in the Senate.
The version of the Dream Act, or the American Dream Act, would be about 800,000 young people who immigrated to the United States when they were not sixteen years old, while living in that country for the last five years and are legally enrolled in a higher education institution or in the army.
But the advocates of the law need sixty votes to adopt the initiative, which is why they rely on the votes of a handful of Republicans. At the moment, the organizations of the advocates of this project are organizing an intensive influence on the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against it and only a Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, has announced his support for the law.
Therefore, the defenders of the Dream Act must get several Republicans on their side if other Democrats should decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most elected Republicans are those from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took over the presidency of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who backed the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they said they no longer supported it on another occasion.
Another Republican who had voted in favour of the law, John McCain, has not yet decided on his position.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act in the Senate is facing the biggest obstacles.
Putting your finger in the wound with literature
The second round of 'The Desire to Language' was a walk where the participants worked hard for the narration.
"I understand that with sex in the language, yes, but... The finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was supposed to open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lengua', a cycle that was aroused by her Spanish-speaking literacy, which was celebrated by her underwriting of the other literature.
The finger in the wound... "makes us in trouble," the Argentine writer spoofed sweetly to the audience, consisting mainly of young people who gathered at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) in order to take Montezuren, moderated by Marisol Shultz, to the table at the Maymíris table.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and then described the Shultz as a great story. Luisa tells in first person and is the protagonist, who is looking to learn what a "wonder" is, and from the doctor to the doctor she does not think of the doctor, she goes from the doctor to the doctor.
She convinces the infectologist: “Patience is not my strength, maybe it’s my wound.”
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologists who stole her breath in the middle of the walk, and who explains to her that wound is not a scientific term, the psychoanalyst reveals the secret: "the wound is the really open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main character of the narrative suffocates and concludes that she "has only learned from the wound that it is truly open and does not exist." But she is convinced that the lust for language and its traps are mixed.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful tale, which he called 'Love of the Invention', in which the finger in the wound is not mentioned, but is discovered.
With hints of magical realism, he tells of a famous wizard who touched the clouds, brought back far-away men or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The story made a turn of events and told of America, the great novel he did not tell of the bertials, and he did not tell the stories of the story, which he did from the beginning of his cast.
“Cervantes, who invited us all (the writers), mocked the deceptive witnesses who appeared in the stories portrayed as true, but otherwise the story of America would never have been told – with imagination that even gave way to the feeling of shame.”
However, he points out, "it is the mad and the liars who best imagine things," and reality and lies approach each other where one no longer knows which side the narrative belongs, where the fictional literature reaches the summit.
He actually calls it the ‘Tradition Cervantes’.
"We have inherited from him to be what is told."
When Mayra Montero was in line, the writer commented and praised the diversity of interpretations to which the film’s invitation to the round table “The Finger in the Wound” had contributed.
The Cuban and Puerto Ricans devoted their contribution to the great wound of social violence that affects their country – like all of Latin America – as a result of the struggles for drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a silent, not intentionally planned commitment," she said, after she stressed that literature is communication and commitment that is between the author and readers as in a "chemical reaction."
The evening was decided by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution also highlighted "These fingers of the dedicated writer in the wound of the writer".
He noted that in a fast-paced world, the intellectual habits and the control of consciousness on dogmatisms also run out, and will be forgotten, "that behind every confirmation there is a small no, and behind every denial a small yes."
"To be in possession of our thoughts and reality, we must nuance: And nuance means often to put the finger in the wound and to harass those who feel much more comfortable when they are in the form of cartoons, in black and white, to put it in front of the real world, to draw the pre-made ideas, without nuances.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in final games, he has experienced ups and abs in his career, but he played three crucial games.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final match, two different styles are given by their respective coaches, and their match marked by opposites is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in finals, he has experienced ups and abs in his career, but three times he has had decisive games, and so far he has held well, which is why this opportunity is of very special importance to him.
The Argentinian has won the medal for the second championship, he is one step behind the winners and surprisingly he has played in consecutive finals with the same team.
The Santistic strategist reached the first final as a coach at Torneo Apertura 2002, when del Morelia had the arrows in his hand, with which he suffered a big defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, at Clausura 2003, he reached the decisive duel that he also scored against Ralorya with 3-1.
Already with Santos Laguna at the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', where they played against Los Diablos, Rubén again had to score a rebound, as the game went out indecisive with 2-2 against Los Choriceros after 210 minutes, but at the eleventh, he came forward with 3-1 and scored the 3rd game and got his 4th chance to win his title.
Rubén had already lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival, so he doesn’t want to be chased by the misfortune and free himself from the evil spell to celebrate a title for the first time, although he confirms that the game itself is the best for him.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break statistics, that's for a club, for my affection, which is why the title will come to me, but what happened before is the most important thing," the driver said when asked about the lost finals.
The final game has remained in his memory until he believes he has learned a lot from it: "The only lesson we can learn from it is that until the referee does not punch the end, we can't celebrate, we're ready for it, we're on the line, the players are ready for it, and the lessons are from it, because the lessons are from it.
Knowing that this series could be decided by malting does not bother him, because he will be familiar with his players: "You never want to get there at the elfmeter shot, you want to finish it in the regular time of play, but sometimes there is no alternative to it, you have to be prepared for the one thing that we were prepared for in the previous tournament.
It is in Romanso power not to be just a second champion and for the first time to spend the glory that the titles bring with them.
The U.S. is changing the rules for obtaining a visa
Individuals must present themselves with the visa application offices before they speak to the consulate; the costs will be shortened.
As of January 10, 2011, the procedures for applying for a visa in the U.S. Embassy and Consulates will change.
In the new procedure, most applicants must present themselves to the Visa Application Services (ASC, the initial letters in English) prior to their interview with the consulate.
The staff of the ASC shall record the biometric data of the applicant, which shall be checked by the consulate prior to the interview.
The new method has certain advantages for the aspirants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa is reduced, as it is no longer necessary to pay separately the termination language, the processing of the visa application and the transport service with which the document is delivered.
The applicant only makes a single payment that covers the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the equivalent of <0x24>140 for a tourist visa, <0x24>150 for visa applications (including visas for time workers) and <0x24>390 for traders and investors.
Those who just want to extend their visa do not have to have a conversation at the consulate, they only have to present themselves at the nearest ASC, where they will submit their documents and take their fingerprints.
As the biometric data is collected in the ASC, the applicants who need a second appointment for the consultation at the consulate will remain there less time than before.
Those who apply for the visa at the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo are no longer required to pay the <0x24>26 service allowance.
Further information on the new visa application procedure can be found on the following website: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visa-FAQs.html
NASA Announces Fund for Extraterrestrial Life
The North American space agency convened a press conference to present tomorrow a fund that will have an impact on the search for living beings in general.
The U.S. National Aviation and Space Agency (NASA) today announced an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The fund will be presented tomorrow at 1 p.m. at a press conference at NASA’s headquarters in Washington by astrobiologists, a science that explores the origin, development, distribution and future of life in the universe.
When convening the press conference, NASA assured that it would present a "intriguing fund for the search for extraterrestrial life", triggering speculation among experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that human-like creatures could exist in hostile environments that were previously thought to be uninhabitable, and it was hypothesized that they could turn into intelligent beings — like humans — if their living conditions improved.
Apparently, it is a microbe found on the grounds of the Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was considered too toxic for all earthly life forms, as the lake is heavily arsenic-containing.
In some way, the microbes use arsenic as a survival resource, and given this ability, the chances that there may be similar life on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere increase.
When these organisms metabolize arsenic, astrobiologists have shown that "there is actually a different form of life, a second form of life that differs from the one we know."
The space agency will announce the actual scope of its fund tomorrow, Thursday, at the press conference.
The conference was attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who explores the possibility of life on Mars, and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who studies Titan (the largest moon of Saturn) under the question of whether its chemical composition resembles that of Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón form opposition bloc
The reform of the organ law on Congress will introduce the two-party system, they complain.
The 60th Legislature had just begun, and an opposition bloc, led by the MPs of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who presented themselves as independents, had already been installed.
Before the opening session in the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo opposed the reform of the Organ Law, as they would be excluded.
With this reform, they repeated, would introduce a ‘two-party system’, because now there would be two people, the same number as the parties that controlled Congress.
These four MEPs, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, the coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones to vote against the presidency led by the panicist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his capacity as vice-presidents.
Corvera Quevedo stated that the PRI and PAN parties had institutionally introduced their political margins with these reforms.
He said they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI over the next few days to change the scheme, based on their political will, and if they had not, they would be subject to re-election by both parties, putting an end to the opposition coalition.
“So far I’m coming (the opposition coalition), that’s what I see, because we’re being excluded from all decisions that don’t even take into account the opinions of the rest.”
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia stated that there would be agreements with PRD, PT and Patrón and that therefore a pluralistic group would be formed.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that Congress, after being monopolistic, should now be "duopolistic".
“It is not in the spirit of law reform that an eternal bipartisan system should prevail in Congress.”
"For starters, this group starts with five Members and they talk to other colleagues so that they become more," said Convergencia member.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, citing PAN and PRI, stated that Congress has now turned into a ‘prey’ for two.
"Earlier it was only one party, now they're splitting it into two."
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect Members and to assign them their place at the negotiating tables.
"Five of the top decisions, which are likely to be nine Members, should not be left outside, and the five, which are currently seen as being divided into different factions, have not decided that we are not united, that we are united, that we have been broken up, and that is why we have taken our place at the negotiating table, and that is why we have taken on board the other negotiating table.
200,000 pesos more for "the supplier"
The municipality of Mazatlán will pay another cheque to the company’s controversial owners of electrical materials.
Another cheque of a little over 200,000 pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city council.
Thus, the sum paid to the company’s owners for electrical materials in the second half of the year amounts to 1,200,000 pesos.
According to the page for more transparency of the municipality, this cheque issued for an amount of 200,144,56 pesos with the number 9258447 was issued on November 16 last for the purpose of "invoicing of open invoices".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had already predicted that more money would go from the municipality to this supplier, which is being observed by the Auditoria Superior del Estado because it sells at excessive prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount that you still owe her and consequently the number of cheques that will still be issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
“Nothing was bought from her, just the debts are paid, just like the other suppliers,” he said in an interview.
The last checks "appeared" in the last quarter of the year "reappeared": September 24, two from October 15, October 19, October 29, and this last from November 16.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as is required by law, when a company is questioned by the ASE in order to avoid other administrations requesting their services, the Treasurer assured that their services would not be taken back.
After the newspaper Noroeste published the examination of the cheques issued by the municipality to its suppliers on July 25, it was announced that from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, during the three-year term of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality of Cachote Sánchez had more than 42 million peecos.
There were also deals with Jumapam, where she collected checks worth over 3 million pesos.
Tourist destinations need to be improved urgently
Tourist companies regret the accident of the foreign tourist as a result of the poor condition of the Gloriata Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
Following the fall of a foreign tourist in the fall of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourism industry of Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay special attention to the areas that are in poor condition and cast a bad picture on the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, chairman of the Zona Dorada trade union, recalled that at various occasions it was required to maintain the destination and turn the bad conditions that tourists find into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said the poor condition of the streets and pedestrians would have had a negative impact as tourists come to the grocery store and see the mess, after which they would turn their backs on the nearby shops.
“Politicals don’t know what it means to have to close a business one day, and they don’t care how much money you lose, otherwise they wouldn’t do the construction work that way slowly and unplanned.”
Hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the tourist’s fall had alerted the city to the lack of prevention and the remaining maintenance work.
"The community must take responsibility and avoid that something like this happens again. How should it do that? Well, instead of improving everything in the afterlife through preventive care," he explained.
"We look forward to having a clean city. Because not only because it is a tourist area, it must be maintained, we residents also have a right to a clean habitat. The city administration must change its strategy in order to keep the city in good condition."
"There are other places that also look careless and unfinished," he said, "for example, the Escudo y el Venadito of Mazatlán."
"Today we need more than just advertising to attract tourists, a good product must be offered, a city that keeps its beaches and streets clean, and the tourist attractions constantly on fire," he added.
"These precautions have not been given enough attention and these types of incidents are just what is obvious to everyone: maintenance is urgently needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Under-Secretary of Promoción Turística, expressed the importance of saving Mazatlán’s tourist sites, as they would not be properly used and caused a bad picture.
He mentioned a number of places that should be brought to Vordermann together with the city. To make the city clean, orderly and attractive for tourism should be priority.
Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites that must first be cleaned and cleaned up in order to make them attractive to tourists and to guide them to the inventory with which we advertise for this destination.
IP calls for results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that MEPs should take on the great responsibility to set an example for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
The Mazatlán business sector calls for a dignified parliament, free from agreements between the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is in turmoil and faces major problems.
Yesterday the 60th Parliament was inaugurated. It consists of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of the PAN, three of the Partido Nueva Alianza, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of the Convergencia and another of the PVEM. That makes up a total of 40 representatives of the people.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do a clean job, feel committed to society and the different social groups that rely on responsible parliamentary work, and not repeat the same patterns of partisanship and paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos, chairman of the CCE Business Coordination Council, suggested that the new Members should take on the great responsibility to set an example for a better Sinaloa that faces many challenges.
"We hope that MEPs will really exercise their right to act free from agreements between the parties, as it is customary for them to make agreements with which they represent their own interests, transforming them into carnival compasses of the rulers and the leaders of parliamentary factions."
He said they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
“We make sure that they do a trustworthy job and work for society and their groups above all, because it was the people of Sinaloa who expressed their trust in the last elections.”
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, chairman of the Tres Islas hotel association, believes one of the major challenges faced by the 40 people’s representatives is the drive and joint work for the country’s economic growth, because today the economic situation is extremely complicated.
“The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which in any way will promote the creation of jobs.”
With regard to the tourism sector, he called on the new MEPs to allocate the necessary role in the state budget to the Ministry of Tourism in order to promote it.
"I have understood that it is the ministry with the second-lessest resources. This is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign exchange and investment into the country and is in direct competition to the agro-industry."
The tourism projects need to be allocated funds, the state security needs to be supported and the alcohol law, which has not been revised in previous legislative periods, needs to be updated.
The Holy King is being sought
Dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys wish the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
The next day, it will be difficult for parents to fulfill these wishes, because the household consists of no more and no less than twelve persons and a goat.
Nevertheless, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not give up the hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and the clothes they desire.
The family lives in a modest house in the settlement of Salvador Allende. They live from hand to mouth, because the father does not have a firm job.
"Sometimes it's hard times because my husband doesn't have a job. But we sell mandarins and potatoes... Already in the afternoon I go with the gates to sell on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
The four-year-old Adelaide would have liked a doll or a bike, while her three-year-old sister, Isabel, wanted a Barbie doll.
Ten-year-old José Alfredo has been wanting to have a ‘monster cart’ for some time now, and his eight-month-old brother, Jesus, is proposing Cayetana clothing the size of one-year-olds.
" (José Alfredo) said to me, 'I'd love this monster so much,' but I replied to him, 'let's wait, boy,' because it was very expensive," Cayetana recalled sadly.
For older children who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
Eleven-year-old María Guadalupe is size 12; ten-year-old Isaiah is size 10, while eight-year-old Miguel is size 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. A pair in size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help realise the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the campaign 'Holy King is being sought' by donating a toy or cash in the reception hall of the Noroeste newspaper.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, as part of the demolition of a cannabis production and sales network, ten house searches were carried out in the administrative region of Estrie.
Fourteen people have been arrested and various charges are being filed.
The house searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, where the drugs were supposed to have served mainly.
“Approximately 750 cannabis plants, four kilograms of hashish, cash and equipment that served the production, have been confiscated,” said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a spokesman for Quebec’s security police.
In total, eleven men and three women were arrested, two of the men who are considered to be the main drug ring’s wire watchers, from Sherbrooke.
The detainees are said to have appeared in the courtroom in Sherbrooke for hours after their arrest.
They could be accused, among other things, of the production of cannabis, its possessions for sale, the plot and the service of crimes.
These house searches had taken place as a result of a lengthy investigation that took place over a year.
"The information received from the public has enabled us to carry out these arrests," Ruel said.
About 70 police officers from the regional investigation unit of the security police of Quebec, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Authority had participated in this police operation.
Secret Immigration could be easily tracked
The Conservative bill, which the government says is supposed to address the problem of ships loaded with secret migrants, is expected to be stamped after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot support the proposal.
“I am reluctant to reject this Charter.”
"I stand with a party that has put fences on your feet," said Michael Ignatieff, head of the Liberals, after the end of the weekly Caucus session in front of the MPs.
The Liberals claimed that the bill, which allows any person identified by a ship to transport illegal immigrants to the sea for up to one year, violates the Canadian Constitution of Law and Freedom as proposed.
Gilles Duceppe, head of the Bloc Québécois, also indicated that he could not support the bill as he turned against the wrong target group.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will wait for what the government is doing," Duceppe said.
Criticism of Olivia Chow’s immigration issue has been pointed out by critics who claim that her party has not been strong enough against the secret immigrants.
“The Neo-Democrats agree to take action against the blind passengers, and this is what we are trying to implement through another bill, the C-35,” Chow said.
We therefore do not support the conservative bill because it seeks guilt from the refugees and keeps children in prison for at least one year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing with politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
“The Canadians strongly inform MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of covert immigration, these criminal acts that affect Canada and treat the country like a pedestrian.”
"They expect Canada to take tough action," Minister Kenney's response said.
“The government has not announced any confidence vote regarding its bill that could have led the country to elections that the government would have rejected.
However, a conservative spokesman for the QMI agency said the government would call for a vote so that every opposition MP would immediately declare himself to his voters.
The new unit does not find unanimity
Despite the announcement of Jean Charest’s possible establishment of a new anti-corruption and collusion unit, numerous observers continue to call for the establishment of a public inquiry committee on the subject.
Robert Dutil, the Minister of Public Security, claims that this idea did not come from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on the issue last January.
The metropolis has a standing unit against corruption since 1870.
However, the announcement of Wednesday has surprised more than just one.
It must be said that this measure was not discussed at all on the occasion of the meeting of the Permanent Committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29 October last year, despite the presence of Robert Dutils.
Stéphane Bergeron, a critic and member of the Parti Québécois, described this announcement as "a rabbit enchanted from the hat" and "a solution properly set up on a table".
Minister Dutil, in turn, had turned to those who feared that the political power had too much influence on the questionable future unity.
“You’ll see the result when we announce it,” he said happy to confirm.
“You are aware of this problem.”
According to Réjean Parent, the president of the CSQ, nothing can replace the conduct of a public survey.
“The more Mr. Charest insists on trying to prevent the formation of this commission of inquiry, the more people like you and I think he has something to hide,” he said.
“The only way to form an inquiry committee is to resign from Jean Charest,” said Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and policy systems at ENA.
In order to get out of this mess, he proposes that Quebec grant a special mandate to the Financial Audit Authority so that it can conduct appropriate investigations about corruption and secret agreements.
"You should be able to extend the mandate of the audit control," he said.
He also believes that Quebec could grant audit controls the same power as Commissioners, which would allow you to oblige people to make statements.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the drawers of the Charest government.
Quebec will also require Ottawa to amend the Penal Code in order to be better suited to this type of crime.
This request comes from Operation Marteau’s Attorney General, who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law in this type of prosecution is not clear.
Vic Toews, the Minister of State for Public Security, confirmed that his colleague of the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with certain novelties concerning this dossier.
During Operation Printemps 2001, which affected the groups of motorcycle policemen, 131 people had been arrested, although the Penal Code had not been enacted.
As a result, Ottawa has enacted the law against gangsters.
Rivers under strict surveillance
Several river runs are still under strict surveillance due to the high rainfall that has occurred in some regions of the province since Tuesday.
In Shawinigan, in the administrative region of Mauritius, there was an earthquake on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were evacuated preventively.
In the evening, another landslide occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the administrative region of Lanaudiere.
A road has collapsed in itself.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rainfall from 40 to 70 milliliters has rained on several regions.
Another 20 to 40 millimetres of rainfall was expected here by Thursday night, according to the regions.
The areas north of the river and the valley of the Outaouais region were the most affected.
In total, up to 100 millimeters of rain spectators had fallen here.
Since the snow melting that has already accumulated in certain sub-regions has yet to be added to these precipitations, there is a fear of crossing several water courses.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebecer Security Service issued warnings about the flooding of the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in the Lanaudiere region.
The river runs in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentian Mountains and the Chêne in Lotbinière will be the subject of flood monitoring and remain under observation.
In the region of Lanaudière, the heavy rainfall has resulted in the overlap of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, an evasion bridge was continued due to heavy rainfall.
Ten homes had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the breach of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, particularly in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The security service remains alert and monitors the situation closely, according to security adviser Annik Bouchard.
The Quebec High Water Center, for its part, issued warnings on Wednesday of the strong rise of several rivers, in particular from Maskinongoé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially corrected
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial backlash before the Canadian Supervisory Council on Broadcasting Standards (CCNR) because of his controversial statements about social welfare and Haitians, as well as because of his overlooked radio speech.
The CCNR is of the opinion that Mr. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team had the right to their own opinion, but certain statements had "inaccurate information about the social welfare and not unjustly negative representations of Haitians, as well as the day-to-day negative representations of the Haitians, which are also considered to be such an unreasonable one.
The Supervisory Board also concluded that a discussion of suicide, which involves the dissemination of the names of two people who committed suicide, violates the Code of Broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding the comments made during the broadcasts broadcast during the period of 2008 and 2010.
The first provision was filed as a result of a complaint from the "Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Québec".
The activist organization had complained that the amounts mentioned in the broadcast were inaccurate.
Rather, the moderators should provide solid as misleading information.
On the subject of suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont had expressed the opinion that suicide was an expression of cowardice.
The majority of the members of the Supervisory Board had concluded that the message conveyed here is that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board considers that the questionable consequences of the broadcast "Dupont le midi" would have dealt with a sensitive issue in a family-friendly and appropriate manner."
Therefore, he was not charged with any tadel against his person.
The last point of the dispute was the statements relating to the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had had a media-effective conversation about this that caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator had declared not to have donated to Haiti’s aid, as it was uncertain whether the needy would actually receive the donations.
The Supervisory Board is of the opinion that these comments have not been of an abusive nature, but that their cumulative effect presents an unjustified negative representation of the Haitians.
"I've already paid my three-day suspension penalty in this case."
"My file has been virtuous for a year and a half," the moderator said.
In all decisions, the Supervisory Board encourages the dissemination of an undisclosed form of expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM broadcaster has acted "beyond its obligations".
The consequences for the broadcaster, who, inter alia, should have communicated its decisions once during the main broadcasting period within a three-day period, are small.
A King of Kung Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, a Montrealer of Algerian origin, took a very special course.
The athlete who shines in "Sanda" (full-contact Kung-Fu), in kickboxing as well as in Thaiboxing is now in search of new challenges to the Tatami and the world's boxing rings.
"I started martial arts like Kung Fu and Kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria," said Zemmal, who has been based in the metropolis since 2008 to further develop among the professionals.
Personally, I’m looking for combat everywhere, because for those who don’t like ground combat, like it’s the mixed martial arts, competitions in North America are rare.”
Recently, the security officer of his sign had given bad news to his rivals at UPS, where he won two gold medals from the World Karate and the Kickboxing A at the World Championship held in Edinburgh, Scotland, between 23 and 30 October.
"I have achieved the victory in the categories of full-contact kickboxing and Thaiboxing," he said.
"I'm currently preparing for the World Cup at San Shou in China."
"It was those fighters from every category who were invited to the last World Cup in the top four."
"I got babe 2009 in Toronto Bronze".
"In 2005, I became an asshole in Vietnam."
"In 2007, I finished fifth in the tournament in China, while in 2009 I was third in Toronto," he added.
“It’s worth mentioning that I’ve made progress in every competition.”
"With this rhythm, I'm going to be the first this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines from China that allow kicks and footsteps as well as ground throws.
The matches usually take place on a platform, less often in a boxing ring.
The most renowned boxer to emerge from this type of martial arts is the American Vietnamese origin Cung Le, who is well known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer were to retain only one event in his career, he would certainly call here his presence at the King of Sanda Super Bowl, the Kung Fu Super Bowl.
"This competition is the highest and most respected in China," the sympathetic pound skerl said.
"It's a bit like the equivalent of the Lumpinee Stadium (Thailand's largest stadium)."
"It was a super experience."
Once in the semi-finals of his category (80kg) he had won his first match before then losing in the final.
"The one who defeated me was a real professional," he analyzed.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals meet each other in the finals of their category."
"Then the winners of each category will offer their heads to crown a single champion, the King of Kung Fu."
<0x24>450 million in contracts without tender
Hydro-Québec has approved <0x24>450 million in contracts for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydropower project in mutual agreement with project planning firms.
In the middle of this labyrinth of more than 100 contracts is a consortium consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has received the most important share, namely the one of the project management, at a sum of <0x24>295 million without tender.
This consortium, called "Énergie gerance", was formed in 2004 as an accompaniment to the decision of Hydro-Québec, the private sector, to assume responsibility for this important hydroelectric project in the amount of <0x24>5 billion.
In early 2005, the consortium "Energie gerance" acquired the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Québécois party, the retreat from corporate consortia is a serious ethical problem, which calls for the risk of distortion of competition as well as an increase in prices.
"This is a new way of playing a de-carded game and unravels competition."
“This means that instead of de-mapping games, instead of being played in a secret way, they are now being conducted in an open form,” PQ MP Sylvain Simard told a news conference.
Early in the morning, Simard had raised the question before the National Assembly, because it seems difficult for him to understand how the public interest can be served in this way.
Resource Minister Nathalie Normandeau had reacted in the afternoon by vehemently saying that the deal was a decoupled game.
"I remain faithful to my line," she said, affirming that the PQ had been "unreasonable" and it "lacked her hard."
She said it was "the least" that the PQ apologized.
The model of the consortium is a common practice worldwide.
It is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies to combine their expertise in a bid for a complex project.
The project "Eastmain" has a high level of complexity in terms of its scope of work.
The construction process is underway and is expected to be completed by 2012.
Nonetheless, the contract was awarded without a competition fight being able to take place; it had already been negotiated.
In addition, the consortium’s model in Quebec is no longer an exception even for relatively simple projects.
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" noted last week, the consortium's model applied in the field of construction engineering and consulting is the subject of government investigations.
A brief overflight of the Quebec company register allows you to name more than 200 consortia, some of which appear to be of a steady duration.
In this way, for example, Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA<0x2B>, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or Roche and Tecsult.
Any connection, and there are dozens of them, leads back to one and the same legal person, namely Dessau.
As for the consortium "Energie Gestion", Minister Normandeau stressed that "the Bay James Territory is subject to a special workforce dynamic and that Hydro-Québec has been taking this fact into account in a special way since the 1970s".
Réal Laporte, the major employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has issued a statement that has left the nose on the fact that the contract on project management was approved after agreement.
"If you make a bid and there are only a few candidates, your prices will accelerate."
"So you have two options: either you take the people who are on this March and say to you, you will negotiate a satisfactory deal at a good price."
“The idea, however, is that it is not the price that is decisive, but the people’s expertise,” Laporte said.
This contract granted to the consortium "Énergie gérance" is part of a long list of contracts of more than 50,000 dollars received from the party Québécois.
The contracts were approved by either Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After review, the newspaper "Le Devoir" included more than 100 contracts of engineers and consultants that companies or their subsidiaries, including in particular resource laboratories, were granted between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had signed 22 contracts, Genivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without including their participation in "Energy Management".
All of these contracts have been negotiated.
They total <0x24>449,783,344, including the contract with "Energy Management" over <0x24>295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard had announced that the four companies that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) were known as the "Parti libéral du Québec".
Minister Normandeau had argued that the PQ was equally linked to the companies they "financed" before clarifying that they were more of their executives.
Barometers Responsible Consumption - The "green" label is untrustworthy
Greener, but unmistakably skeptical.
The Québec consumer has little confidence in the main actors of sustainable growth, but equally little trust in the labelled brands or eco-labels that are intended to control its choice.
Too bad, although it is bathing in a media-effective universe, where it wraps information in favor of a more responsible consumption only so: the barometer of responsible consumption has to complain about a lack of credible information, an inadequacy which he considered to be the slowest of his ability to read.
Although they pushed ahead with the consumption of so-called socially compatible products in 2010, the Quebecers still seem to have little credit for those trying to sell them.
Two-thirds of the population of Quebec admits that in fact, the company’s environmental commitment is as little faith as the green corporate advertising, according to the measurement instrument developed by the responsible consumer center of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the credibility of the official certificates attached to the supposedly fair products, but also the credibility of the products and brands that declare themselves to be environmentally conscious, according to the barometer.
According to the same pattern, the discourse of the politicians on this subject is taken seriously by only 14.6% of the population of Quebec.
However, information on responsible consumption seems important to stimulate this consumer segment, which is currently being revived by only about a third of Quebecer consumers.
In fact, the emptiness and dubious nature of the information dampened the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer after the higher price of the products.
In addition, one-third of Quebecers are distrustful of the performance of the green products and services they are trying to provide.
According to another communication, more than half of consumers had already changed their habits in 2010 and mainly changed the brand of one or more products to express their beliefs.
According to Barometer, they also preferred 61% of purchases from dealers in their neighborhood and favored the purchase of food grown in their region.
Green and responsible - the index of environmentally conscious consumption had reached 64 of the maximum value of 100 this year - the Homo consumus of Quebec likes to present itself as the king of recycling, who tries to curb its footprints in the environment.
However, the social and ecological awareness still seems to stop in front of his car, according to the barometer: just 28% of Quebecers said in 2010 that they used public transport or preferred the carriage centre to demonstrate their ecological interest.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this comprehensive behavioral survey, which feeds on the clichés.
State bond for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec government, which was asked by the Société Angus and the company Parallèle to participate financially in the acquisition of the cinema complex eXcentris, agrees to cooperate, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The developer company Angus and the company Parallèle, which had hoped for a donation of <0x24>7 million from the Ministry of Culture to take over the Daniel Langlois cinema complex eXcentris on Boulevard Saint-Laurent, had not been able to reclaim it again from its cinematic function.
While the government has accepted to engage in this matter, however, on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec government offers an obligation at a lower than initially expected level that could bring a viable solution to life in favourable conditions, at least according to the sources that can be removed from the state’s rumor kitchen.
A first action plan as well as a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, the request has been adjusted to aggregate downwards since it again.
A proposal along with an action plan was already sent by the president of the "Société de développement des entreprises culturelles" (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who heads the eXcentris dossier.
A few days ago, he sent her a final report.
However, the Cabinet’s counterproposal was sent to the SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have until 31 December to respond to these.
In any case, the premises of the state donation seem to have really been pushed aside.
Let us remember that the Quebec owner community of the cinemas and cinema complexes had renounced a direct state investment to support the acquisition of eXcentris by submitting the argument that the minister of cult had not come any financial aid for real estate projects.
However, in contrast, several other market participants in the segment complained of substantial economic aid.
After the self-funded construction of the cinema over ten years, director Daniel Langlois had had great difficulty presenting the author’s cinema in the premises of his cinema complex, which could justify the exemption on the part of the state treasury.
The lack of cinemas showing independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew how to keep his clients at the bar.
The Société Angus and the company Parallèle, headed by Christian Yaccarini, are conducting a privately funded campaign, which they expect to raise <0x24>700,000 to boost the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only one canvas continues to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
The target of the future buyer is to reopen the three cinemas on February 27 next year with the performance of Xavier Beauvois’ highly successful film “Les hommes et des dieux”.
Christian Yaccarini, however, did not call the newspaper "Le Devoir" and one ignores what he and his group hold from the downwards corrected proposals that were made to them.
The Secret of the Complex Shot in Canada
The new U.S. diplomatic channels circulated by WikiLeaks revealed the secret of what the United Nations considered under the Canadians’ minority complex to Americans, but with the same blow they open up the sense of supremacy to Canada.
As a result, American diplomats are amazed that the Canadian voter does not have a meaning in the election of Canadian-American relations, and they believe that President Obama’s visit would have helped the conservative government implement its 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were publicly circulated yesterday, offer even more pictorial details than the purely substantive content you have to rub in.
A link dating from September 22, 2008, i.e. during the period in which the federal election campaign was in full force, reports on the point from which the United Nations no longer participates in the interventions discussed by its political leaders.
To the great amazement of David Wilkins, the U.S. Ambassador employed in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various explanations for this situation.
"A complex of minority almost inhabited by the Canadians may cause Canadian political leaders to talk much more about everyday internal issues than the United States in this election, so he calls on the Black Trader Peter (as he did in 1988).
The United Nations, he concludes, is thus “the literal Goliath of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to speak of it.”
The ambassador understands this “ear-stirring silence” less as the two countries have intense political and economic ties.
"Logically," he evaluated, "it should be the ability of a candidate, a party, and much more of a party leader to lead such an essential relationship that the voter has in mind as a key factor at the polling station."
The other expression of this sense of importance is read in the statement sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, a businessman in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your journey will help ensure the government's continuity in the federal budget confidence vote in early February, when Canada will announce its first deficit in more than a decade, which is due to a <0x24>30-40 billion recovery program," he said.
Nowhere had he mentioned that the government had to postpone the parliamentary session before Christmas in order to prevent the parliament from being overthrown by the coalition and the so-called continuation of the opposition parties would have an impact on the quality of the proposed revival programme.
Another statement dating back to January 2008, written by Ambassador Wilkins, understands Washington from the increasingly negative picture that the dramatic series broadcast on CBC are spreading from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about broadcasts such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which you can observe little subtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or even footage for the purpose of hearings conducted by the CIA.
Again, another statement detailed how Hillary Clinten asked her French colleague Bernard Kouchner at her first bilateral meeting whether Europe was willing to accommodate certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner said yes to the question, but on the basis of an individual case-by-case decision.
At the end of the meeting, he described, "he delivered to the Secretary of State a paper in puncto Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has pledged to review the act again".
Finally, let’s note that the minds are warming up with respect to the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old and very close advisor to Stephen Harper, had explained via CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be "killed".
He referred to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Global Plan for the Renewal of Lighting
Yesterday, in Cancun, the UN proposed a plan to renew the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) equivalent to almost a third of the additional reduction that must be achieved to stabilize the Earth’s climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position in the steps of the concrete major projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun to compensate for the absence of compulsory reduction commitments from developed countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, the main problem in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of FCKWs emitted due to lighting on the ground would be avoided if the white-glossed pears, which would still represent a 50-70% monopoly on the market, were lit by fluorescent or better still by LED lighting.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is equivalent to 70% of the global fleet’s emissions.
In Copenhagen last year, major emission companies such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans to reduce global FCKW emissions from 53 GT to 49 GT.
However, 5 GT would have to be deducted from this balance sheet to stabilize the 2 degrees Celsius rise from today to 2020 in order to prevent it from becoming out of control.
In the white glowing pears, 95% of the energy escapes in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce light.
The compact fluorescent bulbs reduce energy consumption by 75%, while the new LED bulbs reduce this energy requirement by more than twice.
The compact fluorescent bulbs last an average of between 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as the ones that Philips has launched this week - this company, by the way, participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white light bulb.
In addition to the fact that these completely new types of light bulbs emit very little heat, they can also work with a rule resistance.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown that compact fluorescent pumps have reserves because they contain mercury and therefore need to be disposed of as special waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, except for the producers providing an acceptance facility.
The main source of mercury emissions on the planet, however, is not the compact fluorescent bulbs, but rather the coal power plants that emit significantly more mercury to generate the electricity wasted by the white-gloss pears.
In the United States alone, these coal power plants deplete 25,000 tons of mercury annually.
The report outlines in detail the profits that each country would make thanks to this international programme.
Indonesia, for example, would save <0x24>1 billion a year on electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, which is the equivalent of 3.5 coal power plants, the construction of which would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast Expects to Announce Election Results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the "immediate" publication of the results of the presidential election in Côte d'Ivoire immediately after its deadline.
“The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent election commission to maintain its work and to announce the provisional results without further delay,” a UN chief spokesman said.
“He calls on all parties and institutions in Côte d’Ivoire to demonstrate their responsibilities and to refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced.”
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the Election Commission had the deadline set on Wednesday at midnight, three days after the election on Sunday, without publishing the results.
Approximately forty minutes before the deadline, the President of the CEI had confirmed on television that the Commission would "continue to work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, many calls from around the world have become loud, but the CEI may finally call out the name of the winner of the second round under the defunct Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
The Gbagbo camp, however, expects to cancel "fraudable" voting fees in the north by the Constitutional Council, which were achieved by the former rebel camp of the Forces nouvelles (FN) during the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N’Guessan, head of the presidential campaign in Côte d’Ivoire, confirmed that the UN’s maneuvers to intimidate voters in the north of the country had deterred the president’s supporters from going to elections.
The entire election could be cancelled if the complaints filed by Gbagbo are taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, the Gbagbo counterparts are now more of the opinion that the country’s highest court is not neutral, as it is headed by Paul Yao N’Dré, a politically closely related Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who rejects any connection to the ex-rebels, has deemed the delay in announcing the election results "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he has not gone so far as to demand victory.
His allies reaffirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he has lost; and filing a complaint before the Constitutional Court after the election commission has been prevented from publishing the results is illegal.
The second round of the presidential election on Sunday was held for the coronation of the unification and reconciliation process of a country that had been divided into two parts over the years.
The United Nations had warned politicians in Côte d’Ivoire on Wednesday that they could be held responsible in the event of possible outbursts.
Laurent Gbagbo had the first round on October 31, with 38% of the vote against 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who enjoyed the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round), as a top candidate behind him.
Unemployment rate in France remains stable in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Office (IAA), the unemployment rate in France is stable at 9.3% in the metropolis (including overseas departments at 9.7%), according to the preliminary seasonal figures published on Thursday by the Federal Statistical Office of Insee.
The unemployment rate in the metropolis is 2,631 million.
The figures for the second quarter accounted for 9.3% of the employable population in the metropolis and 9.7% among the overseas departments.
Over the course of the year, the unemployment rate increased by 0.1 percentage points.
3.4 million French metropolitan workers were not employed in the third quarter, but wished to find a job, including whether they were employable every two weeks or not, and whether they were looking for work.
The situation of young people in the labour market has deteriorated, with an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolis (<0x2B> 0.9 percentage points within three months, <0x2B>0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% including overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed, according to the IAA.
The seniors, in turn, have seen a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (<0x2B>0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482,000 of those over the age of 50, 6.6% including the overseas departments.
Only the 25-49-year-olds were able to benefit from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage points over three months, <0x2B>0.1 percentage points over a year) and 8.8% in France overall.
Following a discussion of its calculation procedures, the Federal Statistical Office of Insee has not published the monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
Eurostat, the Statistical Office of the European Union, on the other hand, continues this method and announced a rate of 9.8% in France for October (including overseas departments) compared to 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini Accused and Arrested
Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a waste disposal company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rhône Region (PS), was initiated an investigation procedure and he was arrested in the course of an investigation procedure on the public and suspected fraudulent markets.
Alexandre Guérini has been charged with corruption, corruption, misappropriation of public property, misappropriation of public property, co-operation in corruption, illicit bribery and possession of weapons, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and intends to express himself to all the questions that the prosecutor's office will ask him, instead of spreading brainstorming."
"It's easy to submit a number of criminal charges to him, another thing is to prove them," his lawyer Florence Rault told AFP (Agence France Presse) before his client's hearing.
Mr Guérini, brother of Jean-No<0xC3><0xAB>l Guérini, the first man of the PS (Socialist Party) in the department, had valued the fact that a memorandum of justification was given to the judge before his hearing by means of his lawyers.
A Guérini family member, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and detained on Wednesday night.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything other than to keep his depot, which he had to lead, running.
With regard to the area of business competence or the destination of the associated funds, he would never have known, Simon said.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Director General of the Public Service of the Aubagne Ballungsraum, was also charged on Wednesday for defamation and complicity, but then under the obligation to stay away from the protagonists of these acts under judicial supervision.
"My client was able to provide explanations for the facts that were being sued for him."
"The chief prosecutor has considered not depriving him of his freedom," said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four other people were prosecuted and released from prison on Tuesday night, including two under legal supervision, according to Deputy Prosecutor General Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Managing Director of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for “unauthorized influence and passive debris”.
Two state officials of the Aubagne Ballroom, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, one on the grounds of the title "Retirement and disinheritance of public goods by a public service officer", and the other on the grounds of "co-operation in the event of disinheritance of public funds".
Jeannie Peretti, the lifelong companion of Alexandre Guérini, was also accused of "sacrifice and deprivation of social assets".
Among the people confronted by Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently detained for a similar case of public fraud that had affected Corsica.
Fans suspect his society of contributing to the money laundering from “high” criminal circles.
The investigation against X for alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, particularly in the waste disposal sector, will be conducted in April 2009 as a result of anonymous letters in the records of several open investigation procedures.
Close sources of investigation show that the investigation focuses particularly on the conditions of the addition and the operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which also covers waste from the Aubagne area, as well as from certain cities of the Marseille Urban Retreat (MPM).
Affaire Clotilde Reiss: The Elysée Palace exaggerates its mediator function for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher detained in Iran for "spying" the French public in breathing, shifted the diplomacy in alertness and accentuated the acceleration between Paris and Tehran.
All this in the attention of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents received by WikiLeaks and reviewed by the newspaper "Le Monde" give some background to this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had explained its strategy to the Americans, who went so far as to give these advice on how to deal with their own crisis of “hostage” in Iran (a small group of migrants).
They show how the French officials have tried to convince Washington that the release of the young Frenchmen did not seek the release of Majid Kakavand, a man held in France and detained by U.S. judiciary for trade in material in favor of Iran’s nuclear program.
Finally, they put the way in which the French Presidency tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making this the idea credible, that Syrian President Bachar al-Assad played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss, in a griddle light.
In fact, he had done nothing in this regard.
A diplomatic telegram edited in Paris on August 12, 2009, is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to deal with hostages".
François Richier, Elysée Adviser on Strategic Issues, was accompanied by Patrice Paoli, Director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East with American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explained the French method to her.
They urged the Americans to do everything they could to take back their own citizens who would be violently detained in Iran.
"Make noise," they said, "articulated loudly and clearly and without abandonment" the words "fundamental human rights", "innocence", "immediate release" in the media.
This is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image.
"Do this all the more, especially if the Iranians ask you not to do so".
Because "silence doesn't solve anything", past the attempts to discuss in unprecedented ways, the Iranians are "masters in avoidance maneuvers".
Richier added that the arrest of foreigners was a "common, Iranian tactic": "prisoning for the purpose of political blackmail".
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (should occur on August 16, the day she fled to the French embassy) "requires the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230,000 euros deposit).
And he lets the Elysée anticipate further hostage take, a phenomenon that "will exacerbate itself."
“In the near future, the Iranians could arrest another of the 1,800 French citizens living in Iran,” he said.
August 28, 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison 12 days ago, but is still being held in Iran.
An information has been circulated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States is demanding because of the illegal trade of sensitive electronics to Iran, has been released from prison by a judge in Paris.
The U.S. Embassy, like many other observers, raises questions about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which is pursuing the illegal Iranian networks of acquisition of the material provided for the nuclear program, the release of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Did France buy a cow trade?
The liberation of the Iranian against that of the French?
On the occasion of a renewed interview with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "completely surprised by the judge's decision", but has also tried to resist it.
"There has been a rainy exchange between the French Presidency and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the judicial decision," he explains.
Mr. Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand remains under "strict" supervision of the French intelligence service.
The Elysée advisor chooses a phone number, he puts it again, then informs the American diplomat, the Iranian "currently located in the buildings headed by the Iranian embassy in Paris".
While guarding Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée has not spared its efforts to make the Syrian President Bachar al-Assad play an "important" and "influential midfielder role, by means of rumors and organized by the media.
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and find that the manipulation bears fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 summoned "the media flash of the French authorities".
On what is so much "thank you" to Assad, the Paris embassy asks.
“Despite their statements of praise, the French authorities secretly admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done.”
The document then deals with the reasons that led the Elysée to abolish this fiction.
The intensive communication efforts "follow Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria," he analyses.
A policy launched in 2008, which at the time was "perceived by numerous critics in France and abroad as premature and unworthy".
"The Syrian role building up" attempts to lead Paris "in front of Syria, which promises can be made by playing a constructive role in the region".
It is also aimed at "seeding bilateral relations between Syria and Iran".
The U.S. Embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier confided to her: "Of course, we do not know whether the Syrians have done anything."
"But we thanked them after all."
"This should at least cause confusion among Iranians".
Clotilde Reiss will return to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy welcomes them to the Elysée.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the liberation of our countrymen".
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will pass a law called "the Ashbrodel", which will ban young people from playing online games after midnight by blocking them from accessing them, government officials said.
A bill to urge online gaming operators to deny access to these games to young people under the age of 16 after midnight will be submitted to Parliament in December, representatives of the Ministry of Culture and Family described.
"Many children play these games all night long and then have difficulty learning at school and also having a normal life throughout the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," Jo Rin, a ministerial spokesman for the French news agency Agence France Presse, said in a statement.
The online games will be available again from 6 a.m.
The producers would have had a year to prepare for the application of the law, he said.
The government also considers asking manufacturers to downscrew the daily time limit for access to these games to young people whose parents are asking for it, the responsible added.
It will likewise provide free programs to those who wish to make it possible to limit the time spent on the internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries, and newspapers regularly report various, intense Internet-related events.
The country is also an undisputed champion in global online game competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals in the World Cyber Games against 58 other nations.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA appoints the goalkeeper country
On Thursday, the FIFA Executive Committee will appoint the 2018 and 2022 World Cup finalists, a highly political choice in which the rankings for influence and lobbying threaten to push the technical criteria in the background.
However, one thing is certain: the 2018 edition of FIFA’s Royal Discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional High Castle (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will then be a bit more exotic; the International Football Association hopes to be able to win new territories (Catar, Australia) on its own after its premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to pursue its headquarters in the United States or in Fernost (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch Prime Minister, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the scale of an economic and political stance.
The gangs behind the scenes threaten to stop until the last minute.
It is difficult to establish a hierarchy of candidates.
According to the FIFA Evaluation Report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files offer worse arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so important for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the election.
The Sunday Times, which stood with the suspension of two members of the Executive Committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu) at the beginning of the revelations, could equally well ruin the chances for their own country, the cradle of football, which only once held the World Championships.
On Monday, the BBC again gave the floor, broadcasting a documentary report that shot three influential members of the committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
There’s enough reason to upset FIFA and embarrass the English officials, who had run an intensive lobbying with David Cameron in the last few weeks.
The head of government hopes for a re-edition of the chess draw succeeded by his predecessor Tony Blair, which had achieved the organization of the 2012 Olympic Games for London in 2005.
Would this intensive effort be enough to reassess England’s image before the committee?
Nothing is less certain, as the duo Spain-Portugal is not lacking in truffles with its already finished stages, its expertise (WM 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the economic and financial shadows of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible repressions against the English, as well as the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal, increase the chances of Russia, which, despite its gaps in the dossier (stages, hotels, transport), has become an important outsider.
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided to advertise the unmistakable statement on the concerns of the English press "unfair competition in preparation for the vote" on the part of committee members.
"You throw them away with dirt, you try to compromise them," Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, reinforced by the experience of 1994, seems to be the logical favorites.
First world economic power, home to FIFA’s main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have set up a very beautiful project separately.
However, these new candidates appear premature for two countries that co-organized the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: FIFA’s highly anticipated approval of the 2026 World Cup for China, which will detract from Asia’s chances for 2022.
With Australia and Qatar, which had drawn all the registers with the upkeep of futuristic stages, FIFA is pursuing its expansion towards new areas, but these two countries pose a greater risk than certainty.
Australia, as well as Japan and South Korea, could suffer from the weakening of the television rights (due to the time shift) accumulated by European countries, the delicate nerve of FIFA.
Second Mandate: Openness
De Gaulle really did it.
Mitterrand had made him think he was dead.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than this one.
A mandate in the Elysée calls for the next.
The current head of state will be ergo candidate in 2012.
But the openness of the side of the mystery, which clings to the function of the presidency, is not well faced.
So you have to act as if the doubt still exists.
In one sense as well as in the other.
In 2006, supporters Jacques Chiracs claimed that a third term could not be excluded without believing it himself.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy assured in a serious tone that he would make his decision "sometimes in the autumn of 2011".
The fact that he would make the prospect of "two mandates" in front of UMP MPs on Tuesday night in the Elysée had therefore spread a little fever.
Was this the official announcement of his candidacy?
I've missed you.
The president simply reminded that the 2008 constitutional amendment limited the number of five-year terms to only two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
It is not the first time he has mentioned the presidential election on the occasion of such meetings in a humorous tone.
“You have at worst seven and a half years with me, or at best,” he told them in July 2009.
On a new one in May 2010: “Don’t believe I don’t think about the phase afterwards.”
His words from yesterday make him no more a candidate than the day before, but no less.
If they make comments, then for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race for the nomination with the PS on one side.
But it is not the start of the competition with Ségolène Royal that drives Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012 that many members of the PS are admonished earlier than assumed for the campaign announcement.
The bad surveys on the other side.
For the first time, right-wing voters would prefer François Fillon’s candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy’s (46% vs. 44%, according to a BVA-L’Express poll).
“We have a candidate, and there is no discussion with the UMP about it,” the Prime Minister’s environment responded immediately and cautiously.
"If he were to find a defeat as possible, he wouldn't be a candidate," Jean-Pierre Raffarin said.
"He will always believe he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, who has found himself with openness.
Euro: the ECB is forced to retain its purchases of securities
The last meeting of the ECB’s central bank crater last year should provide an opportunity to show how to get out of the crisis, or at least to announce the arrangement of a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures that are due to come to an end at the end of the year.
The crisis of European sovereign debt is obliged, and the central bank in Frankfurt certainly cannot afford to bring about even today’s more than tense situation on the European bond markets, in order not to cause their deterioration.
The political costs would be far too high.
French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed yesterday at a press conference the ECB’s active role in resolving Europe’s state budget debt.
She has not dared to say whether she thinks the central bank could do even more, for example by encouraging its program of government bond purchases.
"I reserve my considerations for my European trading partners (...) ".
Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, had shown himself, as in Brussels the previous day, on the occasion of his hearing by the Economic and Monetary Committee of the European Parliament, not very much speaking about his projects, but rather that we are satisfied with the fact that "the case of the programme is to point out that the
The only certainty is that the ECB will remain unchanged at 1%, the lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB’s Treasury’s bond purchases doubled to approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.35 billion last week.
And according to the indiscretions of some traders, it was said to have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese government securities yesterday.
In total, the Eurosystem’s central banks have made <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>67 billion in purchases since May 2010.
Among traders, the anticipation of further tracking of the purchase price is in no way questioned (see page 29).
The Volkswirte are no longer expecting a remarkable change of course.
If the bonds have already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal for more than three months, the latter will still work on the unrestricted cash reserves in a free-will manner, for a period of one week to three months.
People’s leaders are already aware that this measure will be extended by a few months.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will substantially change its programme."
“Otherwise, it would take the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term,” said Michael Schubert, Volkswirt of Commerzbank.
"A progressive exit planned for the course of the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely to me," said Norbert Bräms, Volkswirt at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the area of its interventions on the sovereign debt market, “the ECB was supposed to maintain such a volume of bond purchases that revitalizes the sluggish market,” adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the relevance of the exposed position of European banks in the euro area sovereign debt markets, the central bank has no choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
“She must at all costs enter the spots of the lack of investors on the market and act in such a way as to prevent the rapid enthusiasm over the returns paid to the weakest states,” a major bondholder testified yesterday.
For if interest rates were to be used for high flights, states would be even more prevented from reducing or even just stabilizing their debt.
This is the price to protect the euro.
The government of Berlusconi in Italy is undercover
After a worrying start to the week for Italy, the situation has relaxed a bit with the decline in corner interest rates to 10 years.
A return to the deceptive silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economic Affairs, Giulio Tremonti, the regional president, had described the situation as "undifferent" and had expected him to have a "unpredictable" weekend, which he immediately denounced.
At least on Tuesday, the scissors with German interest rates had reached their record of 210 basis points, and the prices of the bankruptcy risk contracts had risen to 263 points, which had caused a certain headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out at his Council of Ministers that Spain’s discrepancy with Germany’s interest rates is 400 basis points.
However, his right hand, Gianni Letta, had expressed a “severe concern” about the “market turbulence” and a possible risk of contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, Volkswirt at Hudson Institute.
In the clear text, that is, his problem is the absence of economic growth and the resulting, obscene tax revenues that put the state at risk of not being able to meet its financing needs anymore.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, an Italian growth of 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012 is expected... although the budget available to the Senate is expected to be 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, the European Commission estimates, the budget deficit will still account for 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% predicted by governments) and 3.5% in 2012 (rather than 2.7%).
Therefore also the upheaval for a new budget collective, which could be used after the holidays for a sum of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken," says economics auditor Olli Rehn.
At the moment, Italy receives the support of international institutions.
“The basics of Italy’s economy are in order and its accounts are regulated, which we have been repeating for a long time,” Arrigo Sadun, an Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, who is entrusted with Italy.
“At the moment, there are no problems, neither in the short term nor in the long term, as Italy is demanding less stabilisation progress than other countries, despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A.R.),” observes Pier Carlo Padoan.
The question remains of political inactivity.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of mistrust from the House of Representatives, as a result of which the proposed elections could be organised by the end of March.
There is therefore a rather favourable period for decision-making regarding a serious crisis.
Europeans think about expanding anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde said in a press conference in Paris: "I believe it has been demonstrated on Sunday afternoon as well as in the evening: the Europeans are unambiguously united, ready and committed to defending their currency and their monetary area."
Although completely relative - the deduction recorded yesterday at the interest rates of European bonds was water on the mills of governments and the ECB.
From the beginning of normalization, however, there can still be no talk.
The rating agency Standard & Poor’s had announced that it could lower Portugal’s debt record, which is probably the most effective target of speculators today.
“As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political perceptibility that is particularly burdening the banking systems,” said Exane BNP Paribas.
Most importantly, “the political time is going on much slower than that of the markets.”
The European countries, which are well aware of both this gap and the dangers that lie in it, are intensifying discussions to strengthen the existing anti-crisis measures.
The informal consultations between the most directly affected finance ministers and, moreover, their counterparts to the G20 are progressing well.
And this also in terms of the Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
The plan contains the batch of unconventional measures to strengthen the backbone of euro area countries at the crossroads of markets (see below).
As far as the EU Stability Fund is concerned, its Executive Director Klaus Regling started his Asia tour in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors at a distance about the developments in the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of his visit is not an explicit fundraising, he will certainly prepare the ground for this.
The EU Stability Fund’s first publicity paper expenditure is scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official U.S. representative told Reuters that the United States was supporting a possible increase in the funds mobilized by the IMF’s additional direct commitment.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in the first place, for their part, are pushing for structural reforms, particularly in the area of the labour market organisation.
Reforms that will add to the austerity measures but will have effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid are going a different way than Greece and Ireland have done.
It is one and the other, at all costs, to avoid having to ask for international assistance before setting up their own budgetary corrections and deciding on inevitable structural reforms that bring them back trust in the long run.
In turn, European investors are discussing the options available to accelerate the normalisation process of the bond markets.
Axel Weber, who was on his way to Paris on November 24, was the first to come up with the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to get back into its own pocket.
Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European sovereign debt market, said an extension of the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
This means that the European financial stabilisation mechanism, which currently amounts to EUR 60 billion, exists.
An advisory board that has all the chances of being carefully explored in the European capitals.
Especially when the market conditions are on the rise.
Snow and smooth ice: 24 departments in alarm level Orange
The snow episodes are still attracting traffic difficulties, especially in the secondary transport networks of Britain, and threatening to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in the Orange alarm level due to the threat of snow and glare.
The regions of Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have joined the 20 departments already in the Orange alarm level; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later at night.
According to Météo France, the intense snowmen tangent the north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, it snows lightly on the et Ile-de-France.
In the affected departments, snow covers of 2 to 5 cm, sometimes also 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region are expected.
The regions of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin are affected.
The snowfall is significant enough to cause traffic obstructions and affect certain economic activities, Météo France predicts.
In the Côtes d'Armor region, several regional roads for heavy traffic of over 7.5 tonnes are blocked, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
The traffic situation of the secondary traffic networks in Brittany is very difficult, according to the traffic police, who refuse to use their own vehicle only in the event of an emergency, and the use of some TER buses has been cancelled throughout the day.
In Picardie, school traffic was cancelled for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were envisaged for heavy traffic on Wednesday evening.
The prefecture "requires the drivers to be very cautious on the roads and to adjust their driving behaviour accordingly."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) called on airlines on Thursday to delete 25% of their flights from Paris Roissy Airport and 10% of their flights departing from Orly due to the expected heavy snowfall.
The DGAB recommends that passengers contact their airline.
The Gatwick airports in South London and the Edinburgh, Scotland airport are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernisation of the transport economy in Ile-de-France is in full swing, it rains billions.
At least in the discussions.
In particular, remember the 23 billion for Metro Grand Paris, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
To guide the start of construction of the SGP, the state has announced a capital donation of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4 billion.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that would then allow the SGP to allocate part of the financial sum to its double on the markets.
Today, we finally have the first high-income calculations.
The Supplementary Budget of 2010, reviewed this morning by the National Assembly’s Financial Commission, contains the measures envisaged to allocate the first part of these funds.
There are two types of measures: the creation of a special tax to be levied and a higher taxation of the offices in Ile-de-France.
First, if Article 15 of the bill is taken away, goes "in favour of the public-law institution Société du Grand Paris".
This is numbered: "The product of this tax amounts to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>117 million per year".
The second is a restructuring of the existing corporate taxation: "to modernize it in order to increase the product resulting from it and to account for this increase of the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that cost?
A mystery.
This amount is not numbered in the text.
Of the <0x24>4 billion you are far away.
"It will be carried out that the tax resources will be added to the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4 billion of capital donation that will be made available by the state and will be gradually provided to the Société du Grand Paris for the project," the statement reads.
The SGP does not find this system offensive.
"Since the moment you book revenues (the two taxes, i.e. R.), you can cover the projection for three years and then only get out of the <0x24>4 billion," it is explained.
"This is noted in the budget and gradually deducted".
The SGP suggests that 2013 will begin to record the <0x24>4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, of which the promised four billion will be able to be sought for a long time, runs the risk of sparking a fairly moving parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Revenge hackers and emsy spies
The WikiLeaks affair has a double meaning.
On one hand, it has emerged as an obvious scandal, a scandal that is only a scandal in Sinner’s purity that governs the relations between the states, the citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level, and gives a preview of the future dominated by regression.
But let's go ahead of the line.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every file created by a secret service (a x-popular nation) consists exclusively of newspaper clippings.
The "extraordinary", American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits provide nothing further than what was read in every x-popular journal over the course of months anyway (except those whose owner is Berlusconi), and the frighteningly caricatured stoke cartoonist's profile for her time-both Gadda.
The rule, according to which the secret files may consist only of already known news, is essential to the dynamics of the intelligence services, and not only in this century.
When you go to a library dedicated to esoteric publications, you will realize that every work (about the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templars or the Rose Crusades) repeats exactly what has already been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of occult texts does not want to publish research (although he did not know where to find news about the non-existent), but because those who dedicate themselves to occultism believe in nothing but what they already know and confirm.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
The same with the secret files.
The informant is flawed, and flawed (or limited spirit) is also the head of the intelligence service (otherwise he could be anything, for example, editor at Liberation), who only considers what he acknowledges to be true.
The top-secret information about Berlusconi, which the US embassy in Rome had sent to the State Desert, was the same as those that Newsweek had already published the week before.
So why was such an upheaval made about the disclosures of these files?
On one side, they say what each trained person already knows, namely that the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War and since then the heads of government can call each other or take a plane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic function in Spiona, have lost some of their diplomatic function, and have taken little focus .
Every viewer of investigative movies knows this very well, and it is not from apparentity that one does so to ignore it.
Nevertheless, the fact of repeating it publicly violates the task of purity and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that an x-like hacker can capture the secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a significant blow to the prestige of the State Desert.
In addition, the scandal brings less victims than the "scharfrithers" in distress.
But we devote ourselves to the profound nature of what has happened.
Once upon a time, in Orwell’s time, all power could be grouped together like a big brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell’s prophecies could have proved to be perfectly correct since then, where you can control every movement thanks to the phone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the selected highway, and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.
But if you keep in mind what is happening today that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, then the control process ceases to be one-sided and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker—chosen as the citizen’s enemies—can bring the secrets of power to light.
But how can a power that is no longer able to keep its own secrets?
It is true, Georg Simmel has already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty wiki can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is a secret, but it is essentially a secret to keep them secret, since it is open to the public secret.
WikiLeaks has not done anything wrong by Sarkozy or Merkel, but by Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this abuse, which has been attributed to such a great power?
It is obvious that in the future, the states will no longer put any reserved information online – that would be the same as a hanging hanging on the street corner.
But it’s just as obvious that with the latest technologies, it’s hopeful to be able to keep confidential phone reports secret.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a head of state moved on a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private relationships be maintained in the future and only for certain ears?
I know very well that my prediction at the moment sounds to science fiction and novelty, but I see myself forced to imagine the government agents, secretly moving on uncontrollable routes, moving their communications little over, not in writing, not in the mind of the information, but in the mind of the mind.
The information would be stored in a single copy in closed drawers: basically, Watergate’s espionage attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is advancing like a cancer these days, namely backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communication, the Internet reconstructs a telegraph with (phone) wire.
The (analogue) video cassettes had enabled film researchers to make a film tape for the band, by revolving from the back to the front and venting all the secrets of the assembly, while the (numeric) CDs nowadays made it possible to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. to makro tracing.
By high-speed trains you can travel from Rome to Milan within three hours, while this takes three and a half hours by plane, including the transfer.
Therefore, it is not unusual that politics and communication technology come back on car and horse.
A final observation.
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what secrets were forged between the embassies.
Currently, it is the messages that require confidential information from the press.
Climate: How France beautified its financial promises
One year after the Treaty of Copenhagen, it is time to examine the compliance with the fast-resolved financing promises (also called "fast-start" or premature funding) that have been implemented by developing countries.
And already the rough French beauties have been discovered.
With the Treaty of Copenhagen, the developing countries have pledged to provide <0x24>30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has pledged <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion over three years, France <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.26 billion (i.e. <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>420 million per year).
On the occasion of the opening of COP16, the EU has drawn all the registers to convince its partners of its commitment to fast-start financing: detailed action report by its Member States, press conference, major side events, distribution of brochures.
Operation Transparency is remarkable and valued for its actual value: developing countries and civil society like to see it if all developed countries are doing the same at the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has allocated <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion in 2010, leading it on the right path to respecting its commitment of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion in 2012.
But if you look into detail, things are a little more complicated.
According to the Treaty of Copenhagen, this money should be "new and additional" to ensure that an additional effort has been made without detrimental to public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and extra" means.
While the EU Commission had proposed harmonisation, certain Member States, including France, blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the benchmark he thinks is the best.
For example, the European Commission has chosen itself as a benchmark for 2009: international funding will be retained, and 150 million will be added over three years as part of the "fast-start" funding.
Other countries have chosen similar indicative values, either in terms of year or in terms of conditions at the level of public development aid.
In contrast, France considered that funding for "every new project" of 2010 was "new and additional".
In other words, there are no benchmarks for the expenditure of the previous year or at the global level of public development aid.
Specifically, the total amount of French support for developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease) - France proposes to comply with its commitment to "new and additional" funding.
Another crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans.
There is no rule yet, and everyone chooses their own computing mode.
Some, such as France, have <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1 borrowed as the equivalent of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1 donated.
Obviously, this is only difficult to represent: the difficulty is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often projects linked to emission mitigation based on the most effective technology) can be justified, it is deceptive to present the euro, which is agreed to be the equivalent of a donated euro rate. h. to be used as the equivalent of a donated euro.
But France has nothing other than the following consideration: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros, taking up 91.5% loans (389.8 million euros) and donating 8.5%) 36.1 million euros - see also the EU document to convince itself.
France is the only EU country that uses loans to a large extent.
Germany demands 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among other things) fulfill 100% of their commitments with donations.
In other words, if the overwhelming majority of the European Union spends <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1 to fulfil its obligations, France will only give 10 cents and understands a comparable commitment.
Nice hokuspokus!
All in all, France operates in its fast-start financing with a double swing: on the one hand with a further development of the action over time and on the other with the reality of the financial deployment.
France manages to make it believe that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" million in accordance with its promises, saving 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitration) could have a double negative effect; once inside the EU (why do the other Member States continue with the donation, if it is not enough to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, because the negotiations are completely changing.
The chapter of early funding is only a small question in a relatively short time compared to the whole of climate discussions.
But there could be too many drops in the immense machinery of UNFCCC.
Hopefully this will not be the case.
In any case, it is essential to learn his lesson from this first year of early funding.
First of all, France could announce a change in its accounting style for 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respect for its commitments and fairness with the other countries of the European Union.
Above all, however, France could bring forward discussions on the subject matter of long-term financing (another, decisive and currently discussed topic): one cannot escape the question of "accountability" or the type of accounting of its loans.
France could change its position to be just as progressive on the issues of the dispute as it is on other matters.
So the hope is based on the new Environment Minister Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive next week in Cancun.
A surprising announcement about France’s fast-start and its vision of “accountability” as well as the use of loans would naturally raise the international trust base necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - pesticides taken by children
A 10-year-old child consumes various chemicals over the course of the 81st day, according to a study published Wednesday by the Association Generations Futures (former movement for the protection of rights and respect for future generations).
The association, which explains that their findings "in view of the small number of analyzed samples do not represent a statistically significant value, but represent the illustrative nature of the problem treated", had usually within four months of Paris, from an approx.
These typical meals – including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit portions, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day – were studied as well as nails from laboratories in search of chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The counterbalance is depleting: 81 chemical substances, including 42 classified as potentially or likely carcinogenic and five classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances with endocrine disorders, according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Center.
"Even if the legal limits for any chemical substance taken individually are not exceeded in the approximate totality of cases, this survey is very well understood that the reality in which the consumer may be carcinogenic substances or substances is exposed to endocrine disturbance is noted."
Already at breakfast alone, butter and milk tea already contain more than ten of the potentially carcinogenic residues and three proven to be carcinogenic, as well as more than twenty residues that can affect the hormone system.
The apple imported from Brazil, intended as an intermediate meal for the study, contains traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to green beans from Kenya, including lunch, where the study found traces of a strictly prohibited insecticide in the EU.
In addition, the hacksteak, the tuna from the bush, the baguette and the gum of pesticides and other chemicals were also sliced.
In the conducting water, the analyses have highlighted the presence of nitrates and chloroforms.
During dinner, the salmon steak with 34 determined chemical residues was the "richest", and even the plastic steak used to heat the meal in the microwave was not unloaded.
The end-to-end risk of this "harmful cocktail" for consumers "will likely be underestimated," the study said.
The "Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts" (EE-LV) for its part has proposed "in view of the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "increase in civilizational diseases".
In July, a European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) study identified the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
