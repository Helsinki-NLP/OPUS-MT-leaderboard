Members of the Welsh Assembly worried that they "look like fools"
Among some members of the Assembly, there has been widespread concern about the proposal to change their title to MWP (Members of the Parliament of Wales).
This has come as a result of plans to change the name of the assembly to the "Parliament of Wales".
Members of the Assembly from all political spectrum are concerned that this could provoke mockery.
A member of the Labour Assembly said his group was "concerned that it was recovering with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means "dumb" and pwp means "who".
A Welsh Party deputy said the whole group was "dissatisfied" and proposed alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said his group was "open-minded" about the name change, but said there was little difference between the words "MWP" and "Budalla".
In this context, the pronunciation of "w" in Welsh is similar to that of "u" in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation on the announcement of the change of name, stated: "Of course, the final decision on the appointment of Members of the Assembly will depend on the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the autumn to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation, and the latter's proposal for the appointment of the assembly as the "Parliament of Wales" found broad support.
Regarding the issue of the title of Members of the Assembly, the Commission favored the appointment of "Members of the Parliament of Wales" or "WMP", but the alternative "MWP" found more support in a public consultation.
Members of the House appear to be suggesting alternative elections, but the fight for a consensus could turn into a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to introduce legislation on the changes within a few weeks.
Legislation on reforms will include other changes relating to the manner in which the Assembly functions, including rules for the exclusion of Members of the Assembly and the structure of the committee system.
During the debate on the legislation, the final vote on the issue of their appointment will remain to the Members of the Assembly.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the country's name.
On Sunday, voters will vote to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The vote was set in an effort to resolve a long-standing dispute with neighboring Greece, which has itself a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbor's name constitutes a claim on its territory and has consistently opposed its requests for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the name change, has said he will not recognize the votes.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid for EU and NATO membership.
St. Martin's chapels fall silently, as churches in Harlem face difficulties
"Historically, the elderly people I've talked to say that there's been a bar and a church in every corner," Adams said.
"We're missing both of them today."
He said that the colors disappeared is understandable.
“Today, people are socialized in other ways,” he says.
"Bars are no longer the meeting point of the neighborhood where people go regularly."
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of the properties will not last as long as the leaders claim "and sooner or later they will return to the starting point."
He added that churches could be replaced by residential palaces full of people who would not support the holy places that remained in the neighborhood.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy housing in these palaces are white," he said, "so very soon the days will come when these churches will be closed once well, since it is a good thing that most people who settle in these houses become members of these churches."
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a metropolis of colored people - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original Congregation of White Methodists was transferred in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by a congregation of colorful people, who had their place of worship nearby.
St. Martin passed a congregation of colored people under the direction of Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote people.
In 1939, the building was badly damaged by a fire, but after Father Johnson's family members made plans for reconstruction, they ordered the career.
Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly called the career "the camp of the poor."
The expert who played in his career in July called it something completely different: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also stated that this was the first career in the world played by a colored musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who was transferred to a larger career at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin had not replaced him.
The events of the last few months in St. Martin have been a complex account of architects and contractors, some sent by secular church leaders and others by the episcopal diocese.
The council - the governing body of the famous, composed of secular leaders - wrote to the diocese in July, with concern that it would "try to transfer the costs" to the famous council, despite the fact that the latter was not included in the counter-intuitive and counter-intuitive employment.
Some family members complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A 13-year-old fisherman injured during a dive to catch steamer in California
A fisherman attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he was plunging to catch gaffers in California on the opening day of the gaffer season, officials said.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m., near Beacon's beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was drowning with some friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning, when he heard the boy screaming for help, and then drove towards him with a group to get him out of the bridge.
Hammel said at first that he thought the boy was just excited by catching some crap, but then "I understood that he was screaming, "He bit me!
He kissed me!"
Hammel said that when he reached the boy, he saw that all his keyboard was broken.
"I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a fish in the water!'" Hammel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the children's hospital "Rady's" in San Diego, where he was declared in critical condition.
The species of the fisherman responsible for the attack was unknown.
Coast Guard captain Larry Giles said at a news conference that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks ago, but was defined as a non-hazardous shark species.
Giles added that the victim had suffered traumatic injuries to the upper part of the body.
Officials blocked access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours, for investigative and security purposes.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plans to enter MB's cosmetic market
Sainsbury's is competing Boots, Superdrug, and Debenhams with large-sized store-style cosmetic pavilions, with a dedicated sales staff.
Within the framework of a considerable effort to enter the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion MB cosmetic market, which is continuing to grow as sales of fashion clothes and home furnishings continue to fall, the largest cosmetic pavilions will be tested in 11 countries and the largest pavilions will be tested in two countries.
Investing in cosmetics comes at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to fill the shelves that were once used for televisions, microwaves and household appliances.
Sainsbury's said it would double its cosmetic range to 3000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing lines from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space, with areas dedicated to their respective brands, similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
Also, the supermarket will once again launch its boutique cosmetic line, so that most of the products are vegan - something that is increasingly being demanded by younger age buyers.
In addition, fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will test concessions at Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, south of London, while a second is expected to open later this year.
Online purchases and a tendency towards the daily purchase of small amounts of food in neighborhood stores mean that now supermarkets need to do more to attract people.
Mike Coupe, executive director of Sainsbury's, said outlets will begin to increasingly resemble big stores, as the supermarket network tries to fight the price drops of Aldi and Lidl and more and more expensive products.
Sainsbury's has placed outlets "Argos" in hundreds of stores and has introduced a range of "Habitats" since the purchase of the two networks two years ago, which he said has boosted food sales and made purchases more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to restructure its cosmetic and pharmaceutical departments resulted in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the merger broke down after a debate on how to split income from pharmacists in his supermarkets.
The new strategy comes three years after Sainsbury's sold his pharmaceutical business to Celesio's 281 stores, the owner of the Lloyds pharmaceutical network, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million.
He said Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding an expanded range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the look of our cosmetics pavilions to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in a specialized training staff, who will be ready to give advice.
Our range of brands has been designed to suit every need, and the attractive environment and convenient locations show that we are now an attractive cosmetic destination, which makes a difference from the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'shocked' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
"Dragons Den" star Peter Jones has left "smiling" after television presenter Holly Willoughby has been pulled out of an 11-million-pound deal with his business dedicated to a certain lifestyle, to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of "Truly" household appliances and accessories.
The business of the two was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's "Goop" brand.
The 37-year-old host of "This Morning" turned to Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby has inspired "Dragons Den" star, Peter Jones, after a last-minute withdrawal from their lucrative business dedicated a certain lifestyle - to focus on her promising new contracts with "Marks & Spencer" and "ITV".
Sources say Jones was "shocked" when the golden television girl admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts - worth up to 1.5 million pounds - included her "shouldn't mean anything."
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's "Goop" brand and was expected to double its estimated worth of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, turned to Instagram to announce her departure from "Truly", Jones flew out of Britain to one of his vacation homes.
A source said: "Truly was undoubtedly at the top of Holly's priorities.
It would be her long-term future that she would be accompanying in the coming decades.
Her decision to retreat left all of the people involved absolutely stunned.
No one could believe what was happening on Thursday, she was so close to the opening.
In the Marlow offices there is a warehouse full of goods that are ready for sale."
Experts believe that the removal of the presenter of "This Morning," which is among the most successful British stars, could cost the firm millions, due to considerable investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to more expensive clothes and furnishings, late-fashioned and home-made.
This could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded True with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as its director in March.
The couple spend the holidays together and Jones has 40 percent of the shares in Baldwin's television production firm.
Willoughby is expected to become the brand's ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as ITV's "I'm A Celebrity."
Last night, a source near Jones said, "We don't want to comment on his business issues."
It's like "I'm in love and then I'm in love."
He made a joke about the criticism he would receive from the media because of his comment, which some would classify as "not worthy of a president", and because of the positivity associated with the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said he was mockingly imitating the voice of the news presenters.
“I didn’t give up at all.”
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June was greeted by Trump as a major step towards North Korea's nuclearization.
But the negotiations for nuclearization have been suspended.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, addressed world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday saying that the North does not see any "corresponding reaction" from the Korean side.
On the contrary, he said, the United States is continuing sanctions aimed at keeping under pressure.
Trump held a much more optimistic view in his meeting speech.
"We're doing better with North Korea," he said.
"We were entering a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
We have a great relationship now."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had brought positive results - interrupting missile testing, helping to release hostages, and returning the rest of the U.S. military home.
In his speech about his relationship with Kim, he defended his unusual approach.
"It's very simple to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this broken arena, we'd have about 200 people standing there," Trump said, pointing out to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroys an island, killing hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign nonprofit organizations were told that their presence was not necessary.
Despite the displacement of more than 10 percent of Lombok's population, no national disaster was declared, which constitutes a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, they have made it very clear in many cases that they do not require international support, so the issue is a bit challenging," Mrs. Subung said.
While "Save the Children" is setting up a team to travel to Paul, it is still uncertain whether foreign staff can work on the field.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to aid efforts.
Given the frequent landslides that Indonesia suffers, the country remains very unprepared for the anger of nature.
While shelters have been built in Aceh, they are hard to find in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of a siren to warn the cunnamon in Paul, despite a warning was issued, is likely to have contributed to the loss of life.
Even in the best of conditions, travelling between the many islands of Indonesia is difficult.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was stationed in Lombok for the treatment of the earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive in the new disaster zone.
President Joko Widodo has used the improvement of Indonesia's grassroots infrastructure as the focal point of his election campaign, and has invested generous amounts of money for roads and railways.
But the lack of funding has troubled Mr. Joko's administration, as he faces new elections that will take place next year.
Mr. Joko is also facing pressure from ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim community have embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands have been displaced from their homes after clashes of Christian and Muslim groups on the streets, where hanjara, arrows, and other cold weapons were used.

Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss against Chelsea, with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge took a pass from Jerdan Shaqiri at about 30 yards away from Chelsea's goal, while his team was losing 1-0.
He pushed the ball slightly to his left before making a blow to the far-flung gate.
The ball flew over the area until it drifted toward the top of the grilled cheese.
The ball saved the dancing in the air of Kepa Arrizabalaga and ended up in the net.
"The goal was to get the ball in the right position and players like Shaq always play with the ball ahead, so I tried to create myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I checked the ball with a touch and I didn't think too long but just hit."
Chelsea headed 1-0 in the first half, after a goal in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The blues attacker made a rehearsal to Mateo Kovacic during the game, before rolling next to the field and sprinting towards the Liverpool semi-finals.
Kovacic made a quick combination in the middle.
Then he gave a beautiful vertical pass that took Hazard to the area.
Hazard passed the defense in the speed duel and with a left-handed shot scored in the second column, passing the ball behind Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Naples in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton at the UEFA European League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia is 832.
The number of deaths from earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the national disaster agency said in the early hours of Sunday.
According to reports, many people have remained trapped under the ruins of buildings like the 7.5 earthquake that struck Friday and caused waves up to 20 feet high, Sutopo Purwo spokesman said at a press conference.
The city of Paul, with a population of more than 380,000, has fallen under the ruins of exemplary buildings.

"Also, I would like to appeal to everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught footage, to contact us as they may have essential information for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed the victim was a Birkenhead resident and her body was found inside a residence.
This afternoon, friends who thought they knew the woman came to the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, while police said they were notifying the victim's family members.
A taxi driver in Grayson Mews has attempted to enter his apartment, but has been informed by police that no one is allowed to enter or exit the building.
He remained speechless when he discovered the incident.
Now, residents are being announced that they will be allowed to enter their homes only after a few hours.

Cromwell's statue in Parliament, the last monument to be touched by the debate on "rewriting history"
It would be a deserved punishment for the Taliban's destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts by his puritan fanatic followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Association, said: "In the midst of the current debate on the removal of the statues, it was inevitable to mark the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither commanded nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps this would be a mistaken sacrifice of Cromwell for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the last century.
The excellent portrayal of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a testament to 19th century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe deserves to be praised.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, saw Cromwell as a defender of parliament from external pressure, which of course, in his case, was the monarchy.
The fact that this is a completely accurate portrait is the subject of continuous historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-known individual figure who represents one side of that medal.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and remembered."
The killer was killed by a Chinese farmer.
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to domestic media reports.
The man, identified only by his nickname "Yuan", was found alive with a broken artery and covered in blood near a pork shop in the Liupanshiu market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to inject the pig vaccine into a stable on May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He was said to have travelled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him alive and discovered the door of a pig farm next to the open.
He said there was a large male pig with a bloody mouth.
A medical examination confirmed that 550 pounds of pig wounded the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and saturated," his cousin, who was identified with the surname "Wu," was quoted as saying in the Guiyang evening news.
On footage filmed by the security camera, Yuan was seen entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the evening news that the pig was kept in isolation to prevent another attack, while police collected evidence at the scene.
According to reports, Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating a compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of people attacked by pigs have been recorded even before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their Massachusetts farm, causing serious injuries to her husband.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig caught a Welsh farmer after his tractor, until his wife drove the animal away.
After a farmer from Oregon was slaughtered by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that usually the pigs are not aggressive, but the taste of the blood can act as a "provocator."
"They just want to play.
They're like a very curious little girl... their purpose is not to hurt you.
You just have to show them the right respect,” he said.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to bring heavy heavy rains with extensive stretches to the southwest of the United States.
As expected, the power of Hurricane Rosa is decreasing as it moves towards the coolest waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will cause rainfall as a result of flooding in northern Mexico and in the southwestern United States.
On Sunday, at 5 a.m. Eastern time, Rosa was accompanied by winds at a speed of 85 miles per hour, categorizing herself as a Category 1 hurricane and located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean is beginning to form a low-pressure atmospheric zone, which is moving east towards the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa is expected to approach the tropical rainforest on the southwest coast of Baja California on Monday in the treatment of a tropical rainforest, rainforest, rainforest and rainforest.
On Monday, Rosa will cause up to 10 inches of rain in some parts of Mexico.
Subsequently, the interaction of tropical moisture with the low atmospheric pressure area will result in heavy rainfall with extensive stretches in the Southwest over the coming days.
At the local level, rainfall at altitudes of 1 to 4 inches will cause immediate flooding, waste leakage and possible landslides in the desert.
The tropical high humidity will cause the rainfall rate in certain areas to reach approximately 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in some parts of Nevada and southern Arizona.
2 to 4 inches of rainfall is predicted in some areas of the Southwest, mainly over a large portion of Arizona.
There is also the possibility of immediate flooding with rapid deterioration of conditions, due to the scattered nature of tropical rainfall.
Due to the risk of tropical rainfall, it is not advisable to walk through the desert on foot.
Huge rains can turn canyons into powerful rivers, and straits will bring strong winds and dust storms into the area.
The emergence of the low-pressure area will bring heavy rainfall to some parts of the southern coast of California.
The total rainfall level can reach over half an inch, which can cause small waste leaks and slippery roads.
For the region, these will be the first rains of the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rainfall will begin to approach Arizona on Sunday night and Monday morning, before rainfall spreads more widely on Monday and Tuesday evenings.
The heavy rains will spread across the country on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
October in the U.S. can be characterized by large temperature drops, with temperatures falling in the Arctic, while the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes, this leads to drastic changes in temperatures at short distances.
A good example is the drastic difference in temperatures across the central U.S. on Sunday.
Between the city of Kansas in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa, the temperature difference is about 20 degrees.
During the next few days, the remaining heat of the summer will try to accumulate and expand again.
A good part of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to launch in October with warmer temperatures, with an average of 80, from the South Fields to certain parts of the Northeast.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, a temperature that would be around 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows high chances of over-average temperatures in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people attended Brett Kavanaugh's trial.
More than 20 million people have watched through six television networks interesting evidence of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of alleged sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political blockade continued, and broadcasters interrupted regular programs to broadcast the late-minute reversal of Friday's events: an agreement reached by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for conducting a one-week FBI investigation into the charges.
Ford said before the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh had touched him while he was drunk and had tried to move him to a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a blatant testimonial, said he was 100 percent sure that this had not happened.
The number of followers is likely to have been higher than that of 20.4 million people, Nielsen reported on Friday.
The company was measuring average visibility on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC.
The numbers for other broadcasting networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business network, were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has problems with counting the spectators from the offices.
To put this figure in perspective, the size of this audience is similar to that of a football elimination or that of the Academy Awards.
The Fox News channel, whose audiences have strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, headed the other networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the 24-hour session, Nielsen said.
ABC came second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest continued to remain high even after the end of the trial.
Flake was the main character in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning as he faced protesters' screams as he tried to climb into the elevator to go to the Comic-Con session.
On CNN's live broadcast, he appeared standing with his eyes down for a few minutes as he shrugged.
"I'm standing here, in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth?"
He said to him, "You have power, while there are so many powerless women."
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and before the elevator door closed, he said there would be more to say during the committee session.
A few hours later, all cable and satellite networks were covering directly the moment the Court Committee would vote to pass Kavanaugh's candidacy for voting in front of all Senate members.
But Flake said he would do this only with the conviction that the FBI would investigate the charges against the candidate over the next week, as the Democratic minority had demanded.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with the Coons and several other senators behind him, Flake made the decision.
Flake's choice was smart, as it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without conducting the investigation.
President Trump has called for an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's allegations.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing political games" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing political games" with Britain's future and compromising national interest, in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with the newspaper's main page, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued to attack her Brexit plan, the so-called "Chequers," stating that the proposal that Britain and the EU would "absolutely pay taxes" was a proposal.
Wayde Sims gun kill: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect for the murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
20-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested and interrogated in prison environments on charges of unintentional murder, Baton Rouge Police Directorate said.
Official sources have released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpsons, and police say the Sims had lost his glasses during the fight.
Police have found their glasses on the spot and say they have found traces of Simpson's DNA in them, reports CBS' WAFB branch.
After Simpson was questioned, police said he admitted he had fired a gun on Wayde causing his death.
The amount for his release was set at <0x24>350,000, the lawyer reported.
The Eastern Municipality of Baton Rouge's Legal Doctor's Office released a preliminary report Friday stating that the cause of the death was a gunshot wound from head to neck.
The department thanked the task force of the fugitives near the Louisiana State Police, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University police and the local citizens for their assistance with the investigations leading to the arrest of the author.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the area's law enforcement authorities for "their cell and for bringing justice to the country."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot and 6-inch dialog grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
In the last season, he had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 strikes for each game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball team coach Will Wade said the team was "sad" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"That's what we're worried about all the time," Wade said.
Volcano tossing over Mexico City
The volcano Popcatepetl has reached the southern neighbourhoods of Mexico's capital.
On Saturday, the National Center for the Prevention of Disasters warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the crater was re-elected and 183 gas emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The police have monitored a number of incidents and incidents.
Images on social media showed layers of silver that had covered car windows in some neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in volcanic activity, which is 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of independence votes
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with peaceful police forces, while thousands themselves joined rival demonstrators to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote on the road.
A group of masked pro-separatists, surrounded by peaceful police forces, hit with eggs and powder paint creating dark clouds of dust along the roads that tourists usually swallow.
Later in the day there were also crawls, while the police had to use rubber rods to end the clashes.
For several consecutive hours, repeating the motto "We don't forget, we don't forgive", pro-independence groups faced Unionist protesters shouting "Spanish Fire".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries taken during the protests, according to local press reports.
In the region where pro-independence sentiment prevails, tensions continue to remain high even one year after the October 1 referendum, which is considered illegal by Madrid, but is celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The overwhelming majority of voters voted for independence, despite the fact that the participation was low, as citizens against the coup boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, about 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting in polling stations in the region through violent clashes.
On Friday evening, pro-independence groups set up camps outside to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The protests continued, but were forced to take another leak.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in the separatist protest along with his wife, said he had no hope that Catalonia would gain independence in the future.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
"I saw my parents cry for joy that they would have the opportunity to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite the fact that in last December's local elections they achieved a vital victory, although with a narrow result, the pro-independence Catalan parties have had a hard time keeping the hovin this year, as many of their most well-known leaders have either withdrawn or voluntarily withdrawn from detention and detention from the host country.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, who was recording the protest on his phone with police assistance, said the conflict was fueled by politicians from both sides.
"The situation is getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in prison awaiting trial since late last year, said he would run for the European Parliament next year.
"The removal of the candidate for the European elections is the best way to counter the regression of democratic values and the oppression that has been done to us by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Some people arrested after car crashed into house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car crashed into a Londonderry house several times.
The incident occurred in Ballyngard Crescent on Thursday, around 7:30 p.m.
Detective Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the main gate and the apartment itself.
It is believed that at some point an arrow was thrown in the direction of the car.
Manga's defeat forgives Livingston a 1-0 win against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the win
The team coming from a category below, Livingston surprised the Rangers by causing Steven Gerrard to lose second in 18 games as the team's coach from Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's defeat proved decisive while Gary Holt's team scored second-place Hibernian.
Gerrard's team has not yet won an off-field match in the Premiership, this season and next Sunday, will face the Hearts, with a difference of eight points.
But before that, the Rangers will be waiting at home at Rapid Vienna, in the match valid for the Europa League, on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has extended the series of consecutive wins to six matches and coach Holt hasn't tested the loss yet since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses cases against well-established opponents
Holt's team should have spent many minutes ahead of scoring, as their direct attacks caused the Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson managed to pass but knocked weakly at the gate, and then Alan Lithgow hit out on the top slip after being given head-on by Craig Halkett.
The locals were willing to leave the Rangers to play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems in standard strikes.
That's how the goal was scored.
The Rangers caused a penalty kick and Livingston created the space. Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined to create the opportunity of Menga, who hit and scored in the center of the area.
By that time, the Rangers had dominated the holding of the ball but domestic defense had turned out to be unparalleled and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had almost never been put to the test.
This gameplay continued in the second half even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a wait.
Scott Pittman's strike was stopped by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor while Lithgow was knocked out by another Livingston standard strike.
The harassment came continuously into the Livingston area and was continuously cleaned up, while two penalty claims - after Halkett's intervention against the comeback player as deputy Glenn Middleton, and another for hand-to-hand touch - were not taken into account.
Game 'Fenomenale' by Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland on the Tony Macaroni Arena
It's a fantastic performance and result for Livingston.
For one man, they played great and continued to exceed expectations in this growing trajectory.
The style of the game and their team have not changed much since their return to the top, but a great merit belongs to Holt for the way he has electrified the team since his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was exceptional, leading a perfectly organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in difficulty throughout the game.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although in some cases they have played very well under Gerrard's leadership, they have lacked quality.
Missed the final pass - only once managed to pass the opponent's defense - and this is something that should serve as an alarm for the Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an is expected to be in Cologne
Saturday (September 29) was characterized by a blue-sky smile as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which was aimed at regulating relations between NATO allies.
They have come into conflict with issues such as human rights, media freedom and Turkey's membership of the EU.
Afterwards, Erdogan headed to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
The city is home to the largest number of Turkish population outside of Turkey.
For security reasons, police stopped gathering a crowd of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but still many supporters took to the streets to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of whom were Kurds - also raised their voices to condemn both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him in the country.
Opposition protests reflect the distinctive ability of a visitor adored as a hero by some German Turks and despised as autographs by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after collision with car
A cyclist has died after crashing into a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwoord Street with Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the ambulance providers came immediately, but the victim changed lives on the spot.
The collision occurred months after another cyclist lost his life in an accident where the author left the villager, which took place on Childers Street, about a mile away from Saturday's crash site.
The Metropolitan Police said the officers were working to identify the person and notify his family members of the incident.
Roads have been closed and buses have been told to use other roads, while car drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Injured During Rebellion
Six prison officers have been injured during a riot in a high-security prison for men, the Prison Office said.
The rebellion erupted at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST on Sunday, and continues.
Tornado's specialist officers have been called to keep the riots under control, involving eight inmates and who are confined to one side of the prison.
Officers have been treated on the spot for some mild wounds to the face.
A Prison Service spokesman said: "The prison personnel with specialized training have been mobilized to keep under control the incident that is currently taking place at HMP Long Lartin.
Six members of the staff have been treated for injuries.
“We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and have made it clear that the persons responsible will be referred to the police and can receive prolonged imprisonment.”
HMP Long Martin hosts over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had undergone hospital treatment after an attack by one of the prisoners.
And in October last year, peacekeeping police officers were called to jail to keep under control a serious situation, where staff were attacked with balloons.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with immediate flooding (which can be an advantage for drought areas)
Although a tropical depression rarely strikes Arizona, it's most likely that's exactly what's going to happen next week's first days, as the remaining power of Hurricane Rosa passes through the desert of the Southwest, spreading danger to the world.
The National Weather Service has already issued immediate flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Salt City, and Flagstaff, Las Vegas.
Rosa is expected to head to Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching in the early hours of the rainy Monday.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that "only ten tropical cyclones have received the status of a storm or tropical depression in a 200-mile radius from Phoenix since the 1950s!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated amounts up to 6 inches on the Arizona border.
In other desert areas in the Southwest, including the Central Rockies and the Great Basin, rainfall is expected to be at level 1 to 2 inches, while in isolated areas their total may reach 4 inches.
For areas outside the risk of immediate flooding, Rosa's rains can be a blessing, as the region is hit by drought.
Although flooding is a serious concern, some of these rains can be useful, as the Southwest is currently facing drought conditions.
According to the U.S. Centers for Dry Surveillance, just over 40 percent of Arizona is facing extreme second-class droughts,” weather.com reported.
Hurricane Rosa will hit Mexico's Baja California suburb.
Rosa, still hurricane-powered on Sunday morning, with winds at a maximum speed of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm is colliding with cold waters over the Pacific, and is losing power.
Accordingly, the hurricane is expected to hit Mexico with tropical storms on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rainfall over some areas of Mexico may be strong, presenting a significant risk of flooding.
Rainfall of an average level of 3 to 6 inches is expected from Baja California to the northwestern Sonorus, and can reach up to 10 inches, weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move north through Mexico, in the treatment of a tropical storm, before reaching the border with Arizona in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then move through Arizona, reaching Utah in the south.
"The main risk expected from Rosa or its consequences are strong rainfall in Baja California, in the northwestern Sonoro and in the southwestern desert of the United States," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These floods are expected to cause immediate life-threatening flooding, waste leaks in the desert, and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old were arrested as suspects of remaining in the attempted murder, after wounding a 16-year-old with a knife in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was escorted to the hospital, where he is currently in a "stable" condition.
According to Avon and Somerset police, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
Officers have called on anyone who may have caught video footage of the incident on their mobile phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh is "faced with the Democrat Party's humiliation and anger"
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the Democratic Party's ruthless and ruthless tactics," Trump said at a West Virginia Wheeling meeting.
Trump said Kavanaugh was "faced with the Democratic Party's humiliation and anger" during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were adolescent.
Ford also gave a testimony during the hearing regarding her indictment.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day "the American people witnessed the greatness, qualities of character and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"A vote in favour of appointing Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in favour of one of the most intelligent lawyers of our time, a lawyer with a clean public service record," he said in front of a crowd of supporters in western Virginia.
The president said Kavanaugh's appointment was delayed during a speech on the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
"Five weeks separate us from one of the most important choices in our lives.
"I'm not a candidate, but I'm contributing," he said.
"So I'm doing so much effort and I'm fighting for great candidates."
Trump argued that Democrats have a mission to do “blocked resistance.”
The Senate's first major procedural vote on Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior GOP aide told CNN.
Hundreds killed by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, as figures are expected to rise
At least 384 people were killed, many of whom were struck by giant waves that collided on beaches when Indonesia's Sulawesi island was hit by an earthquake and tsunami, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves up to six meters (18 feet) collided on the shore in the muzga, causing many people's deaths and destroying everything that was coming forward.
Tsunami followed a 7.5-foot earthquake.
"Yesterday, when the threat of cunami was born, people were still carrying out their usual activities on the beach, and as a result they did not run immediately and fell victim to it," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the agency, told a news conference.
"He didn't come alone, he took the car, the trunk, the house, hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 miles per hour) before hitting the coastline.
Some people climbed into the tree to save the cunnamon and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Peru.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster agency showed a number of destroyed buildings and shops, deformed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftermath of the earthquake continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy emitted by Friday's mass earthquake was about three times the power of the atomic bomb threw at Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical position of the city, which is at the end of a long and narrow bridge, could have multiplied the power of the city, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "great taxes" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
Some bodies were found trapped under the ruins of the buildings, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 had disappeared.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and the extent of damage could be much higher along the 300 km (190 miles) coastline north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closest to the earthquake's epicenter.
The communications networks were "completely interrupted without any warning" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
The area has over 300,000 inhabitants," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that staff and volunteers were travelling to the affected areas.
"This has already turned into a tragedy, but the situation can get even worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency was severely criticized for not announcing Paul's hit by the tsunami, despite officials saying the waves had arrived at the time the warning was given.
In amateur movies distributed on social media, a man on the top floor of a building can be heard warning passers-by on the way down to the arrival of the cunami with furious screams.
Within minutes, a wave collided on the shore, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately verify the truth of the filming.
The quake and tsunami caused a massive energy interruption, which cut communications around Paul, making it difficult to coordinate rescue efforts by the authorities.
The military has begun to ship cargo aircraft with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuated people continue to have high food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has been reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was expected to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia is over 800.
The situation is quite severe.
While World Vision staff from Donggala have arrived in the city of Palu without problems, where employees are being sheltered in a tarpaulin shelter in their office yard, they witnessed scenes of destruction along the way, Doseba said.
"They told me they had seen so many houses destroyed," he said.
The situation is quite severe.
Although aid groups began serious efforts to put humanitarian aid mechanisms in motion, some complained that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise were being stopped from travelling to Paul.
Under Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and external staff can only begin to circulate if the disaster zone has been declared a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a disaster at the regional level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Since the government says 'O.K., this is a national disaster', we can ask for national help, but this status has not yet been granted."
On the second night after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday in Paul, friends and families of the missing people still had hope that their loved ones' case would be of those few miracles that sometimes occur in the event of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of a well.
On Saturday, rescue forces released a woman who had been under wreck for two days, with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national parachute team, had trained two of the missing parachutes for the Asian Games, which closed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others of the people locked up in the Roa Roa hotel, including Mr. Mandag, were his students.
"As an old professional in the field of parashutism, I am very emotionally charged," he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls that in the hours following the news of the Roa Roa hotel collapse among the parachutism community, he was desperately trying to write on WhatsApp to competitors from Paul, who were attending the beach festival.
However, his messages ended only with a gray-scaled sign, instead of two blue-sided signs.
"I think that means the messages weren't sent," he said.
Thieves steal <0x24>26,750 during the restoration of a Newport ATM in Levee
According to a press release from the Newport Police Directorate on Friday morning, some robbers stole <0x24>26,750 from a Brink employee who was restoring an ATM in Newport, Levee.
The driver of the vehicle had been emptying a ATM at an entertainment center and was trying to distribute other money, Detective Dennis wrote in a statement.
While he was busy at work, someone "came running after Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money destined for delivery.
According to the statement, witnesses had seen some suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The song changed its name to Ye
Kanye West will change his name to Ye.
Releasing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Officially known as Kanye West."
The 41-year-old West has long been called Ye's nose, and has used it as the title of his eighth album, which came out on the market in June.
The change came shortly before his release on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album "Yandhi".
He will replace the singer Ariana Grande on the show, which can't come for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current name for art, West has been expressed in the past that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year, speaking about the title of his album with radio presenter Big Boy.
"But I am you, I am us, I am us.
I went from Kanye, which means "only," to simply "Ye," which is the reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is more a reflection of what we are.”
He's one of the many celebrities who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known differently as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he said he preferred the name Love and Brother Love.
A former West co-worker, JAY-Z, has done as he did with or without a separation visa and capital lettering.
Mexico's AMLO pledges not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's newly elected president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has vowed to never use military force against civilians as the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody repression against students.
On Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza, Lopez Obrador vowed to "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, military forces opened fire on peaceful demonstrators on the square, killing 300 people, at a time when left-wing movements of students were rising across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by granting monthly scholarships to students and opening more public universities free of charge.
He said the unemployment and lack of opportunities for education are pushing young people towards criminal gangs.
The U.S. needs to double its funding for artificial intelligence.
"While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount spent on research in the field," said Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and artificial intelligence expert who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after various parts of the U.S. government announced discoveries of artificial intelligence, despite the U.S. lacking an official general strategy for artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China announced its plan last year: by 2030, it aims to take the first place for innovation in the field of artificial intelligence.
"Defiance of the budget for research in the field of artificial intelligence would be a good start, as other countries are still far behind the U.S. and we are looking for the next big discovery in this field," Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the chances that the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence will take place in the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, author of the book "The Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order", published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the executive director of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the world's smartest intelligence companies.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he created an artificial intelligence system that also passed to the leading U.S. player at Othello, and then worked as executive director at Microsoft Research and as president of Google's China branch.
Lee congratulated previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Agency's Robotics Challenge for Advanced Research Projects in the Defense Field, and asked when the next contest would take place, in order to help the new identification of the virus.
Lee said that often, researchers in the United States had to work hard to get grants from the government.
"It's not China that's removing academic leaders; it's the corporations," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed illuminated minds from universities to work in the field of artificial intelligence.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could help the U.S. push its endeavours in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think green cards should be automatically given to people with the title of doctor in the field of artificial intelligence," he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council issued a Plan for the Development of the New Generation of Artificial Intelligence.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China provides funding for individuals in academic institutions, as well as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide money for American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which is expected to include partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the establishment of the Executive Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
Meanwhile, this month DARPA announced a <0x24>2 billion investment in an initiative called "AI Next".
As for the NSF, it currently invests over <0x24>100 million a year in research in the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation aiming at the creation of a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not been enforced for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change the country's name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum to decide whether its name would be changed to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that could resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which had been blocking the European Union.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, believes its northern neighbor's name constitutes a claim on its territory, and has imposed a blocking veto on its membership in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change could compromise the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonian slaves.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in a referendum, and a boycott campaign has cast doubts whether participation in the election will reach the 50 percent necessary for the validity of the referendum.
The question in the referendum poll reads: "Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU through the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that for Macedonia, as one of the countries created by the dissolution of Yugoslavia, this is a price worth paying to achieve membership in structures such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although the referendum has no compulsory power, a sufficient number of members of parliament have expressed that they will adhere to the voting result to make it decisive.
The change of name requires a majority of two-thirds in parliament.
The State Election Commission said no irregularities had been reported until 1 p.m.
However, voter turnout was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the recent 2016 parliamentary elections, where 66 per cent of registered voters cast their vote.
"I came to vote for my children, we have a place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their votes in the referendum on Macedonia's name change, which will pave the way for the country's membership in NATO and the European Union.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and placing chairs in front of tents erected by the referendum boycotters.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not by entering the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"Our country is poor, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want us by the name of Macedonia, we can go to other countries like China and Russia and become part of the Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring enough investment for Macedonia, which has a rate of unemployment of over 20 percent.
"I think the overwhelming majority will be in favour, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after his vote.
He said a positive result would "confirm our future."
According to a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research, about 30 to 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum - a figure below the required level of participation.
Another survey conducted by Macedonian television Telma found that 57 per cent of the participants had planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote in favour.
For a successful referendum, the participation rate must be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would give the first strong blow to the pro-Western government's policy, since it came to power in May last year.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero passes through all of Brighton's defenses to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling faced all of Brighton's defenses in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his goal in the 65th minute look incredibly easy.
The Argentine shooter took a pass in the middle at the start of the action.
He scored through three Brighton defenders before coming out on the open field.
Later, Aguero found himself surrounded by four green t-shirts.
He overtook a defender and passed the speed duel several others at the entrance to the Brighton area.
Then he went to the left where Sterling was.
The English striker used his outing in the area to follow the Agueros ball, which hit with the right and crossed goalkeeper Mathew Ryan by throwing the ball on the right-hand corner of the net.
"Aguero is suffering from a foot problem," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about how he would play for about 55 or 60 minutes.
Here's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the blues the first advantage in the Premier League game.
This goal was scored in the 29th minute.
During that action, Aguero took the ball in the Brighton half.
He's got Laroy Sane on his left hand.
Sane took a few steps ahead of stepping toward Sterling in the second column.
The blues attacker brought the ball into the net and then slipped out of the boundary lines.
The City will face Hofenheim in the Champions League group stage on Thursday at 12:55 p.m. at Rhine-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to keep the role of "president" against the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the chance to reach the eliminators, there was no reason to impose another start.
But Scherzer, who is always competing, hopes to be given the opportunity to score against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there is a playoff chance for the Rockies, who have an advantage with a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West National League.
The Rockies got at least one chance for a playoff thanks to a 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday night, but are still trying to get the division title.
"Although we're playing for no reason, at least we can score by recognizing the atmosphere of the fans here in Denver but also the fact that the opponents will play at the highest level that we can face all year round.
"Why wouldn't I want to play in such a challenge?"
The Nationals have not yet announced who will be the title holder on Sunday, but they are reported to be inclined to leave Scherzer in such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom he would be the 34th appearance as the headliner, headed a training session on Thursday and can be featured on the field on Sunday, which could be a normal rest day for him.
The player from Washington, who shot to the right is 18-7 with an ERA 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 of the shots this season.
Trump to gather Western Virginians at the meeting
The president was briefed on the situation with regard to his High Court elector Brett Kavanaugh before speaking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
"It's crucial for everything we've done so far.
Five weeks separate us from one of the most important choices in our lives.
"This is one of the biggest choices - I'm not running, but I'm contributing, and that's why I'm trying so hard to fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this terrible group of radical Democrats, you see what's going on right now.
And they have divided their minds to take over power in any way, you see the disgrace of their filth.
They don't want to know who they hurt, who they push on their feet to take power and control. That's what they want, power and control, but we won't give it to them."
Democrats, he said, have a mission to make “blocked resistance.”
“And you’ve seen this in the last few days,” he said, calling the Democrats “innocent, ugly, dirty and unfaithful.”
He was referred to as Senator of the Senate's Democratic Judicial Committee, Dianne Feinstein, which sparked discontent from the audience.
"Do you remember her response?
Did you share the document?
Well, well, what?
No, no, no, I... wait a minute... - her body language was pretty bad - it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer an "open church".
She is intolerant to those who say what they think.
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted in favor of the motion of disbelief against me, they weren't so inhabited.
After all, I'm not the first of the Labour MPs who are said to be unwelcome - all because we say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated in a similar way, simply because he strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of disbelief was a criticism of me for agreeing to age with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security and on Europe, an ironically similar issue for which Jeremy contradicted previous leaders.
In the announcement of the Labour Party meeting in Nottingham East, it was stated that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of my eight-year term as local Labour MPs, the meetings of the GC have been the same.
Unfortunately, the meetings no longer have their previous tone, and the promise of a "softer and more gentle" policy has long been forgotten, if ever existed.
It has become increasingly apparent that the opposite views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and every opinion is judged on the basis of its admissibility by the leadership of the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, while colleagues with whom I thought I shared similar political views began to claim that I was taking a 180-degree turn and holding positions with which I would never have agreed - whether on national security or on rail.
Every time I speak in public - no matter what I say - critics explode on social media, with people calling for my dismissal, denouncing the policies of the center, telling me that I shouldn't be part of the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only one who has suffered this.
I am aware that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since comments about me tend to be of a political nature.
I'm amazed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face gender and racial discrimination every day, but don't hesitate.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of levels of violence.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said the Labour Party must feed a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer an "open church", and with every motion of faith and with every change in the rules of selection, the party becomes increasingly closed.
Over the past two years, I’ve often been advised to sit down, not be so noisy, and so everything “will be fine.”
That's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school pupil, driven by Thatcher's government's negligence that led to my class failing at a general school, I've tried to lobby for a better public service as a local mini-student for those who have more than one.
I've never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
Everyone in Nottingham East had clear my political stances and points of opposition to the current leadership.
For all those who voted in favour of Friday's motion, I just want to say that the country is heading towards a Brexit that will affect our families, businesses and public services. I can't understand the desire to spend time and energy with my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But in fact, the only message I want to convey is not Nottingham Momentum, but my voters, whether or not members of the Labour Party: I am proud to be at your service and I promise you that no further threats of dismissal or political favor will prevent me from doing so.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: The Impossible Ayr leads the list
Two delayed attempts may have somehow altered the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in the extremely entertaining Tennent's Premiership match today.
They are now leading the list as the only invincible team among ten teams.
In the end, it was their wonderful defense and the courage to take risks the one who secured the win to the local team, and coach Peter Murchie was absolutely right to be satisfied.
"We've shown ourselves in every game, and we're still unbeatable, so normally I'm happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "We want to congratulate the Ayr team, who took more risks than we did."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, turned to goal by Frazier Climo, passed Ayr in advantage, but a yellow card for Scottish player Rory Hughes, who came for this challenge from the Warriors, allowed Melrose to show off his superiority and the top scorer.
Climo increased Ayr's advantage with a penalty while shortly before the end of the first half, he scored and turned to goal an individual action bringing the score to 17-5 for Ayr before the break.
But Melrose started the second part well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, back in the goal from Baggot, reduced the difference to five points.
Subsequently, there was a long interruption as a result of the heavy damage to Ruaridh Knott, who was removed with a barrel, and after the game resumed, Ayr increased the score through a Stafford McDowall attempt, scored by Climo.
Ayr's captain, Blair Macpherson, was subsequently punished with a yellow card, and Melrose again exploited the fact that they had one more player, with a goal-scoring attempt by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a hard-pressing part.
However, the locals returned and when Struan Hutchinson was penalized with a yellow card for blocking Climo, without a ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson made a "touch down" after Ayr's third (maul) heading forward.
Climo scored and did the same thing almost after the game resumed, after Kyle Rowe captured the ball hit by David Armstrong in the area and led forward attacker Gregor Henry, for the fifth attempt of the local team.
The "Stil Game" star seems set for a new career in the restaurant industry
"Still Game" star Ford Kieran seems determined to enter the hotel industry after it was revealed that he has been appointed director of a licensed chain of restaurants.
The 56-year-old plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the BBC's famous show, with his longtime co-writer and co-protagonist in the world of comedy, Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that season nine will be the last for the show, and it seems Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source for Scottish Sun made it clear that Kiernan was trying to enter Glasgow's "flowering restaurant industry."
"The sea is ours": Bolivia hopes without exit to the sea that the court will open the way to the Pacific
Marines patrol an improvisation of the naval fleet headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings have raised the blue-colored flag of the ocean.
On the sea bases from Lake Titicaca in the Amazon, the motto is: "The sea is our property.
His resignation is a duty."
Throughout Bolivia, the memory of taking the coast from Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict is still quite alive - as well as the desire to sail once again across the Pacific Ocean.
Now, these hopes are more likely than they have ever been in decades, while on October 1st, Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice following a five-year review.
"Bolivia is characterized by hovi, the spirit of unity and tranquility, and of course, is looking forward to the result," said Roberto Calzadella, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will be following the GJND session on large screens around the country, hoping that the Hague court will decide in favor of Bolivia that - after decades of irregular discussions - Chile is forced to hold talks on the seashore with Bo.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president - who is facing a controversial battle for a second term in next year's elections - the decision on Monday is quite important.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is very unlikely that the courts will decide in favor of Bolivia - and that even if they did, they would change very little.
The U.N. body based in the Netherlands has no time to give another state part of Chile's territory, and it has been said that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the GJND is coming out with a decision just six months after hearing the final arguments shows that the issue "was not complicated", said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And instead of helping the cause of Bolivia, the events of the last four years may have penalized it.
"The issue of access to the sea has been compromised by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric has vanished all traces of charity left to the Chileans, she suggested.
At a certain point, Bolivia and Chile will continue the talks, but it will be extremely difficult for discussions to take place after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, opposed the idea that the court's decision was surprisingly quick.
On Monday, it will offer Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and "a chance to end 139-year-old disputes, with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - was using the maritime issue for political interests.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"Decision is an opportunity to understand that we have to leave behind the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't take place as long as it can't trust the U.S.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his nation will never be the first to carry out nuclear disarmament, as long as it can't trust Washington.
The young man was holding a speech on Saturday in front of the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made during a summit in Singapore between the leaders of rival states.
His comments come at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be on the verge of a revival of nuclear diplomacy so far, more than three months after Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong-un.
According to New, the hopes that the continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to the declaration on the end of the Korean War will make North Korea kneel down are hopes of no end.
As long as Pyongyang does not act first to make significant dismantling moves, Washington hesitates to accept the statement.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about Pyongyang's intention to withdraw his arsenal, which the state most likely sees as the only way to guarantee his security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris unveil the latest line of giant chapels, which will soon come to the streets of your city
If you want to enrich your collection of hats or provide full protection from the sun, don't look any further.
Stylists Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of strange giant chapels for their SS19 collection in the porch, which left all stylists open-mouthed at Fashion Week in Paris.
The very impractical chapels have been given on Instagram this summer, and these stylists have released their amazing creations.
Valentino's special creation was a very extravagant beige hat, stacked with a wide shelter with puppet-like details, which surrounds the model's head.
Other great accessories include stone-decorated shells, a magic hat, and even a pineapple - but they're not made to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of strange masks - together in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had purple lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than high-couture.
One creation resembled diving equipment, complemented by an air pipe and water glasses, while another resembled a melted ice cube.
And if you like to follow this bold fashion - you're lucky.
Fashion analysts predict that giant hats may soon come to the streets of your city.
The trend of giant chapels has followed that of "La Bomba", the two-foot wide-covered chapel, which we've all seen, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand, which hides behind the very impractical hat he took on social media, brought out another great creation in the porch - a cashmere beach bag, almost as large as the bathing suit model that was wearing it.
The light orange rafia bag, stacked with a rafia stick and with a white leather handle at the top, was Jacquemus's most special creation of the La Riviera SS19 collection at Fashion Week in Paris.
Renowned personality stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "Next summer I expect to see a giant chapel and beach bag on the streets of the city - as the stylist has left such a big impact that it would be hard to ignore the demand for large accessories."
John Edward: Essential Language Skills for Global Citizens
Private schools in Scotland hold record for academic excellence and this has continued in 2018 with another series of excellent exam results, further reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other fields.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), strive to offer the highest level of service to their pupils and parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for further higher-level education, for their chosen careers and their country as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailored educational curriculum, we are demonstrating how modern-language skills continue to be a widespread and popular choice across schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, "If you speak to someone in a language that he understands, your words go to their ears.
If you speak to him in your own language, your words go to your heart.”
These words are a powerful reminder that we can't rely only on English when we want to build relationships with people from foreign countries.
From the results of this year's final exams, we can find that languages are leading the list of results, with the highest rate of passing grades among private schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who have studied foreign languages have received the maximum score A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of the students had received the maximum A score in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied Spanish, and 63 percent of those who studied French.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as one of the vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, foreign language proficiency is considered as important as STEM branches (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of private schools.
A 2014 study by the UK Employment and Skills Commission found that among the main difficulties employers faced in filling vacancies, 17 per cent of them were linked to a lack of linguistic skills.
As a result, language skills are becoming more and more necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
With the addition of jobs that are subject to the mastery of foreign languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career you choose a person, if he has learned a second language, he will have real advantages in the future, as the master of such a long-term ability.
The ability to communicate directly with foreign people will automatically position a multilingual person over their competitors.
According to a survey by YouGov, which included more than 4,000 adults from the UK in 2013, 75 percent of them were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to develop a conversation, and French was the only one with a specific 15-speech language.
That's why investing in language learning is important for today's children.
The mastery of many languages, in particular the mastery of languages of developing countries, will give children a better chance of employment.
Within Scotland, each school will be different in terms of the languages taught in them.
Some schools will focus on more modern classical languages, while others will offer languages considered the most important to the UK in the 2020 outlook, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a range of languages from which you can choose in private schools, with pedagogical staff composed of specialists in the field.
Scottish private schools are dedicated to providing a school environment that will prepare children and "arm" them with the skills they need to carry out, whatever the future.
In these times it cannot be denied that in a global business environment, languages continue to play a vital role in the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
Modern languages should truly be regarded as "the ability to communicate internationally."
Private schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to the young people of Scotland.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Board of Private Schools.
LeBron is expected to debut with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans who were waiting to see LeBron James in his first game for the Log Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening game of the pre-season on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It is not yet known how long he will play.
"They're going to be more than 1 and less than 48," Walton said on Lakers' official website.
Lakers' correspondent wrote on Twitter that, most likely, James will play for a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game pre-season program.
"I don't need the pre-season matches at this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
Trump's timing of West Virginian clashes, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump launched a series of election rally tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This will be the first of five such gatherings planned to take place next week, including stops in friendly areas including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of approval left a stand for his election to fill the vacant seat in the High Court, Trump aims to create support for upcoming short-term elections as Republicans risk losing control in Congress when elections take place in the months ahead.
What time is the Trump summit in West Virginia today and how to follow it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled to take place at 7 p.m.. Eastern Time tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow Trump's tubing in West Virginia online below, via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week's hearings in the High Court of Candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who was stressed over allegations of sexual misconduct, with the pending vote of confirmation from the Senate remaining heavyweight for a week.
But the primary purpose of these numerous clashes is to help Republicans take a step forward in confrontation in the November elections.
Trump's campaign staff said the five rallyes next week were aimed at "energizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority held in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many countries as he can as we head towards the tight campaign season," a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Planned to take place at the Wesbanko Arena in Wheeling, this evening's rally could bring backers from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia's Metro News news agency.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump visits West Virginia, the country where he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Senate Republican candidate for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who has been left behind according to polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come and try to push him into polls," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team showed readiness to fight while keeping hopes alive by heading for Sunday's empty races
After three seasons, the remaining four for Sunday afternoon, it could be what this Ryder Cup needed.
This thrill of rolling, is a totally created sporting concept, but a concept in which players truly believe and never more than in such races.
Where can we tell you how it feels now?
"They had a six-point split that has now gone to four, so we can say that some kind of creep has been created somewhere," said Jordan Spieth as he closed the day.
Of course, Europe has an advantage with four points ahead, while remaining in the game and twelve points.
As Spieth says, Americans hope that the odds are in their favor and have a lot to encourage, especially by the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and took three out of four possible points.
Spieth has been ruthless from the start of the shootings to the pit and is leading by giving his example.
The party's brooches were added as it came round, inserting the golf ball with a simple blow to bring the game to a level playing field, when he and Thomas were two points down after two rounds.
His lightweight tongue that gave them the win of the game in the 15th hole was expected with a similar brawl, which shows that he believes the American team is still not out of the race.
"You just have to work hard and worry about your game," Spieth said.
All the players are gone now.
18 holes to leave a trace.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange, but adorable European couple, has achieved four out of four and can't go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only pair to not catch a shot over the minimum on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided shots over the minimum on Sunday morning, Friday evening and at nine second shots on Friday morning.
This result and the way they seem to flow their energy towards the enthusiastic crowd and the comments reinforce the idea that they are the players to win on Sunday and that there will be no other player more famous than Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible victory over the National Golf.
Possibly both at the same time in different pits.
However, the statements for a European triumph are still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson came out very easily with Sergio Garcia, the four-game hero of the morning, when he fell in pairs with Alex Noren.
One point above the minimum and two doubles in the front placed the Spaniard and the Swedish in a pit from which they had no chance of getting out.
However, on Sunday, no one will be there to help you get out of your pit.
The four-and-a-couple games are so amazing to be closely followed due to the interaction between the couples, the tips they give, the tips they don't give, and how to change a strategy there for there.
"Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant lead until the finals, but these four sessions also showed that the US team will still fight even though some people, especially the United States, have put this into doubt.
Europe leads 10-6 while heading to the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe has a substantial advantage on the Ryder Cup final day after coming out of the four games and with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
Inspirational duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the two-victory race against a struggling Tiger Woods to increase their four-point lead at Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, offered to take the trophy that he lost to Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the powerless American team in the two-match matches of the morning, leading it to a 3-1 result series.
The American team showed more resistance in the fourth game, winning two games, but they couldn't reduce the difference.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points out of 12 individual matches on Sunday to hold the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European starter to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed 'Molliwood', are the second pair in Ryder Cup history to win four points in their opening four games.
After knocking out Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourth game, they combined well enough to defeat a powerless Woods and American starter Bryson Dechambeau with an even more dramatic 5&4 score.
Woods, who played hard two matches on Saturday, showed last year's majority explosions, but he has already lost 19 of his 29 matches in the four-and-a-half game with doubles and 7 consecutive matches.
Justin Rose, who rested for the fourth game in the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the doubles game and got a 2&1 loss from Dustin Justin and Brooks Koepka - ranked first and third in the world.
Europe didn't have everything in its favor on a pretty nice and fresh day in the southwest of Paris.
Three-time professional winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the difference that was to be caught by the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They took a bold 2&1 win against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in four matches and returned later to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in 4&3 matches after losing in the first two pits.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup a team has returned the result after a four-point difference in individual games, although Furyk's holder team needs only one match to hold the trophy.
However, since he was the second best player for two days, a Sunday counter-attack seems to go beyond their chances.
North Korea says it will not be “destroyed in any way” unilaterally without gaining trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations that the continued sanctions on Saturday deepened the U.S.'s gross distrust and the country would not in any way renounce its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Yong Ho told the annual body from all over the world that North Korea has taken "significant measures to show goodwill" last year, such as banning nuclear and missile tests on non-proliferation, dismantling of non-proliferated and gold-produced areas.
"However, we are not seeing any responses from the United States on this," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, our national security will not be self-sufficient, and in these circumstances there is no way that we can mutually destroy ourselves first."
New reiterated North Korea's usual complaints about Washington's resistance to a split "phase" approach to the nuclear disarmament process in which North Korea would be assessed because of the step-by-step steps that North Korea has taken, as it has not yet done.
New was referring to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at a summit held for the first time between a U.S. president in office and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim vowed to work towards a "nuclear breakdown" with a secure Korean warhead.
North Korea has demanded an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has expressed that the Peninsula must initially give up nuclear weapons.
WASHINGTON has also resisted calls to ease the international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists that nuclear disasters be initially carried out and increases the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal in a compulsory manner, even by opposing the 'declaration of the end of the war'," he said.
"The perception that sanctions can be on our knees is the dreams in the sun of people who are uninformed about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are deepening our disbelief."
Young did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, a statement the U.S. leader stressed earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister underlined three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the party on the issue of the nuclear disaster were South Korea and not the United States, the process of the nuclear disaster in the Korean peninsula would not be the case."
Despite this, the tone used in the new speech, was profoundly different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly, that the placement of U.S. territory under targeted Korean-North rockets was unavoidable after "President Trump's bluff with Mr. Kaitlyn."
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, thanked Kim for the courage shown in taking steps for disarmament, but said there was still a lot of work to be done and that the sanctions needed to be carried out.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a time frame for it, saying "If it's going to take two years, three years, or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the U.N. Security Council should reward the Peninsula for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said at the United Nations Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and uninterrupted until the verification and completion of the verification has been carried out."
The Security Council has unanimously decided to increase sanctions on North Korea since 2006, in an effort to end funding of Pennian nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met at the UN General Assembly and said he would visit Penn again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go so well.
He left the Peninsula in July saying there was progress, and within hours North Korea denounced him having carried out "mafia-style acts."
North Korea pledged at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile zone and also a nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures."
He said Kim had told him that the "appropriate measures" he was seeking were security guarantees that Trump pledged in Singapore and a move towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Take Lessons on How to Relax Enough
A new course at Harvard University this year has involved all students to sleep more, in an effort to fight the growing culture of ‘mass’ of study through the use of caffeine from these ‘sleepless’.
One academic noted that university students number one in the world often don't know when it comes to the basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Hospital and Women's Hospital, prepared the lessons course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start this course after giving a reference to the impact that sleep has on learning.
"At the end of the day, a girl approached me and said, 'Why is this being said to me now, in my last year?'
She said no one had spoken to her before about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, included in the program for the first time this year, explains to students the essential elements of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as how it improves their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university's general director of medical services, said the university decided to present this course after finding that students were seriously deprived of sleep during the week.
The course that lasts an hour involves a number of interactive tasks.
On the one hand, there is a view of a comfortable room, where students click on the cups of coffee, curtains, athletes and books so that they can explain the effects of caffeine and lighting and how the athletic performance is affected by the lack of sleep, as well as the weight of the bed.
On the other hand, participants were explained how deprivation of sleep over a long period increases the risk of heart attack, ischaemia, depression, and cancer.
A camp map, with an interactive icon, further encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that the behavior of the students will not change immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know - as you have a right to know, the health impact when you choose to smoke," added Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of pride to spend “a night without sleep” continues to exist, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students meant that deprivation of sleep was an ever-increasing problem.
Ensuring that you have taken the adequate dose of sleep, of a good quality, should be the students’ ‘secret weapon’ to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said – even to avoid weight gain, because deprivation of sleep leads to hunger and hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studied physical and chemical biology, helped Professor Czeisler prepare the course after attending one of his lesson hours last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and had inspired him to turn it into a course for the whole camp.
He hopes that the next step, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before joining competing institutions.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students should set an hour of sleep when they need to go to bed, and also that when they need to wake up, be aware of the harmful effects of ‘blue light’ coming out of electronic screens and LED lighting, which can bring problems to the brain.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga scores against Gerrard's boys
The Rangers took another hit as visitors as Dolly Menge's hit gave Steven Gerrard's broken side a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
The Ibrox team was looking to record his first win since the February 4–1 win at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as a coach, leaving his team eight points behind the leader of the runaway Premiership Laird.
Menga scored seven minutes before the end of the first half and with a Rangers team placement that seemed completely powerless to balance.
While the Rangers now fall sixth, Livingston climbs third and is right behind the Hibernian for goal difference.
Rangers can expect to have more trouble after their wing player Calum Spence was treated for a headshot after being hit by an object likely to be thrown by visitors.
Gerrard led eight changes to his team, which passed Air in the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
On the other hand, Holt, entered the same 11-she field that stole a Hearts point last week and that he would feel pleased with the way his well-organized team drowns opponents in every round.
The Rangers may have dominated holding the ball, but Livingston created more when he owned it.
They should have scored just two minutes from the start of the match, when the first pass that Menga gave Scott Pittman in the door square protected by Allan McGregor, was not properly used by him by throwing the ball out.
A long cross from Keaghan Jacobs' penalty hit found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, only shot him out in the back of the door.
The Rangers took control of the game but it seemed that they had more hope than they really believed in their game in the opposing zone.
Alfredo Morelos thought he deserved a penalty after four hours of play as he and Steven Lawless collided, but arbitrator Steven Thomson did not hear Colombian complaints.
The Rangers managed to carry out two knocks at the gate in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not worried about the headshot of Lassana Coulibaly and the powerless blow of Ovie Ejaria.
Livi's first goal in the 34th minute may have been contrary to what was seen on the field, but no one can deny that they deserved it only for the grind they showed.
The Rangers again failed in the service of long passes for Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher hit the ball towards Scott Robinson, who kept the calm to pass the Menga and to score in a simple way.
Gerrard acted on the break between the parts while replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and this change barely gave an immediate effect while the side effect followed for Morelos, but impressingly Kelly ran from his position to block him.
But Livingston continued to make guests play as they like, where Lithgow and Halkett pass each other long balls from time to time.
Holt's team could extend his lead to the final stage, but McGregor stood firm and denied Jacobs before Lithgow jumped out of a ball taken from the corner.
Rangers deputy Glenn Middleton later claimed another penalty while he was confused with Jacobs, but Thomson again allowed the advantage.
Almanaku: The Inventor of Geiger's Measurement
And now a page from our almanac "Sunday Morning: 30 September 1882, Like today 136 years ago and IN WASHINGTON... the day the next physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the production of what is known as the Geiger meter.
A major pillar of science since then, Geiger's measurement became a major pillar of popular culture as well, as in the 1950 film "The Heavens of Coronado," with a cast of seemingly unprofessional scientists such as Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the fuck is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger gauge used to track radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
"When you put these pads on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms emitted by radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "Don't tell me, I'm really listening now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that holds his name continues to live.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "distinguish" bad cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "distinguish" bad cells and kill them.
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize bad cells as part of treatment.
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory.
They can ‘distinguish’ a protein that is severely found in many types of cancer and then re-injected
A vaccine that is being tested is showing promising results in patients who have several types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells, noted that ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, changing them in the lab so that they "distinguish" a protein that is severely found in some types of cancer called HER2, and then in the re-injection of these cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show us that we are dealing with an overly promising vaccine."
HER2 "stimulates the growth of some types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients to "teach" them how to detect cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West appeared in a Pro-Trump tube, wearing a hat with the inscription MAGA, after his appearance on the SNL.
It didn't go well
Kanye West was applauded by protests at the studio during a broadcast on Saturday Night Live, following a disappointing performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for the post in 2020.
After playing his third song for that night called "Ghost Town", where he was holding a hat on his head that wrote "Make America Great", he came to speak with strong tones against Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
"Every time I talk to a white person and they say to me, 'How can you like Trump, he's a racist?'
"Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a parody that featured Matt Damon, where Hollywood star Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Commission on charges of sexual harassment raised by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it wasn't broadcast, West's hard speech recordings were uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It remains unclear whether Rock is trying to joke with West with that post or not.
West also complained to spectators that he had spent a hard time in the backstage because of what he had put in his head.
"They put me in the backseat.
They said, “Don’t go out on stage with that hat on your head.”
They've mistreated me!
And then they tell me I'm submerged," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West asked, "Do you want to see the sink?", stating, "I put my superman's hat on my head, because it shows that no one can tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go ahead?
Try out the love."
His comments were whispered at least twice by spectators and members of the SNL cast appeared to feel ashamed, Variety reports, where a person told the newspaper: "The whole studio fell silent."
West was summoned as a late substitute instead of Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller, had changed his life a few days ago.
West surprised many with the interpretation of the song "I Love It", dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was backed by TPUSA conservative group leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: "For one of the most courageous souls: THE FALIMINDER THAT HELPED IN THE BALL OF TURMS."
But broadcast moderator Karen Hunter tweeted that West was "just herself and that's extraordinary."
"But I choose not to reward someone (by buying music or clothing or by supporting his 'art') for whom I believe it embarrasses you and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
While he's free.
That's what we are," she added.
Before the show, the singer said on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was already "the generation that was formerly known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper partner, Snoop Dogg, had the name Snoop Lion and also the late musical legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist known as Prince.
Indictment for attempted murder with a knife at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was hit with a knife in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast First Ladder Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
‘Game of Thrones’ star, Kit Harington, has a toxic effect on masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as a swordsman in the character Jon Snow, in the violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor hit the stereotype of the male hero, saying that the appearance of such roles on the screen makes young boys realize that they need to behave as strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes "something went wrong" and was asked how the problem of toxic masculinity could be solved in the <0x23>MeToo movement era.
Kit, who recently married his co-star in Game of Thrones, also 31-year-old Rose Leslie, admitted that he feels "slightly important" to solve the issue.
"I personally feel that this issue is quite important for the moment - where we've been wrong with the appearance of masculinity?" he said.
"What have we learned to men as they grow up, about the problems we're eating now?"
Kit believes television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to the over-male characters appearing there.
He said, "What is born, and what is taught?"
What is learned on TV and what is learned on the street, which makes young boys believe that they should behave in a certain way in order to feel men?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time - how to change this?
"Because there's obviously something wrong with the boys."
During the interview, he also admitted that he would no longer shoot for "Game of Thrones" after the series ended at the end of next summer, saying that "drifts and horses have come to the top of his nose."
Starting in November, Kit will take part in a remake of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a filmmaker and his brother the thief.
The actor recently showed that dating his wife Rose is the best thing he got from Game of Thrones.
"In this production I found my wife, so we can say that this show gave me the future family and defined my life from now on," he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the sentimental interest of Kit’s character, Jon Snow, in the science-fiction-winning ‘Emmy’ award-winning series.
The couple were married in June 2018 at Leslie's property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported a 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected across the country, health authorities say.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most of the new cases are transmitted through sexual intercourse, showing a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly to parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who get HIV through this way had almost gone to zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sex is an acute issue in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but it is still said to dominate discrimination against LGBT people.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have measured that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually marry women.
Most of the transmission of the disease occurs due to inappropriate protective measures during sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to medical medicines for the treatment of HIV as part of an effort to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies GOP senators’ data has been disseminated by staff members, saying these are “dangerous lies” and “conspiratory theory.”
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her staff posted personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on the lawmakers' pages on Wikipedia.
The Los Angeles Democrat has denied that these claims were being pushed by experts and online "extreme right-wing" websites.
"Lies, lies and only disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information is reported to include home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on sexual misconduct against High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The disclosure came shortly after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Some of the conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that IP addresses identifying the source of the publications were linked to the Waters office and extracted data from a Waters staff member, Hill reports.
"This unfounded claim is totally untrue and a big lie," Waters continued.
"My staff member - whose identity, personal information and security has been compromised as a result of these false and assertive claims - has not been in any way responsible for the flow of this information.
This unfounded claim is totally false and a big lie."
Waters' statement was immediately faced with online criticism, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is frustrating," Fleischer wrote.
"That means she doesn't have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven't done, they shouldn't be upset.
It doesn't have to be provocative.
You don't have to question the defendant's motives.
He needs to be calm and peaceful."
Fleischer appeared to be comparing Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of appearing very nervous during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is running for Waters in midterm elections, also posted his statements on Twitter.
"It's a great chance, if it's true," he wrote on Twitter.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had signaled "the relevant authorities and law-enforcement institutions on these false allegations."
"We will ensure that the authors are revealed, and that they take legal responsibility for all their actions, which have a destructive and dangerous effect on everyone from my staff," she said.
"Johnny English hits again" - a comedy with the unequipped spy Rowan Atkinson
It has been the case that in every new British-influenced film, hidden messages about the Brexit theme are seen and this finds application and re-enactment on the stage of the comedy-action venture "Johnny English" - which began in 2003 with "Johnny English" and "Johnny English" with the rich.
Would this satirical comedy out how clearly unfit we are to be linked to new national opportunities in the field of exports?
In any case, the eye-opening character, with Johnny English's face like a rubber and apparently unlucky, has been given the authority to confuse things for the second time - his name, which shows more than anything else that he's a wide-ranging comic creature, but not in the dark.
Of course, he is a mangled secret agent, who, although strangely pretending to appear as a magician, has little from Inspector Clouseau, little from Mr. Bean's character and a portion of that guy who contributed only to the release of a sound in Loretta's song, "Oli Fillot's".
He also relies on the mystery man, traveler, and international Atkinson, who once played in television commercials that are now forgotten about Barclaycard, leaving the country in chaos wherever it went.
There are a couple of great moments in this movie.
I really liked it when Johnny English approached the helicopter dressed in a medieval piece of armor and the blade of the helicopter crashed slightly into his helmet.
Atkinson’s physical comedy, however, appears to be vague and sometimes exaggerated, especially when ‘serious’ films like 007 and Mission Impossible have included a little bit of comedy as an ingredient in their films.
Humor seems to be aimed at children more than adults, and Johnny English's crusades are not so creative and are focused on voiceless movements, the same as what Atkinson does in Bean's character.
The main theme in this film is the fact that the UK is in serious danger.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated the super-secret network of British agents, uncovering the identity of British ground agents and has levied the agent on duty - unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last chance for a prime minister who appears as a pompous and battle-ready figure, who is already suffering an extraordinary political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her best to realize the character resembling Teresa May, but there's not much text in the script she can play.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that every active spy has been compromised, so she will have to rely on someone who has retired.
And that means choosing Johnny English, who was now employed as a school director in a high-level neighborhood, but who unofficially gave lessons on how to become a secret agent: here there are beautiful scenes, because English is offering a school-shaped spying academy.
English is once again called in Whitehall for an urgent meeting and reunites with his former student, multi-player Bough, who is once again played by Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, tied to a submarine captain, in the role of a high-level girl, where Vicki Pepperdine has been misused for this role.
So Batman and Robin's doing things totally back in His Majesty's Secret Service, are back in action, confronting the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova played by Olga Kurylenko.
In the meantime, the prime minister is enchanted by the fascinating billionaire of technology who claims it can solve the difficulties of British computers: league Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their funny and cruising odyssey: masked as a waitress, set fire to a beautiful French restaurant; cause chaos as they enter the luxury yacht of Volta; and English gets totally confused as he tries to use virtual devices instead of virtual reality.
All sequences are usually made for the final scene, but regardless of whether it's fun and noisy, everything looks a bit like a children's movie.
A lot of moderate things.
As in other Johnny English films, I couldn't help thinking: Is the British film industry not a role for Rowan Atkinson that would fit his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it has a plan for the British to work four days a week, but to be paid for five days.
The Labour Party led by Jeremy Corby is considering a radical plan that would make the British work four days a week - but pay for five.
The party is reported to want companies' bosses to save by using the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution for employees, giving them an extra day of rest.
We would see that employees would enjoy a weekend with three days off - but continuing to bring home the same salary.
Sources said the idea would “compatible” with the party’s economic agenda and plans to return the country in favour of workers.
The transition to a week with four working days is an idea that has been embraced by the Congress of Trade Unions, as a way for employees to benefit from the changing economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
"It's not going to happen immediately, but a four-day week of work is an aspiration that aligns with the party's approach to balancing the economy in favour of the workers and also with the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to embrace this idea, where the Green Party has also pledged a week of four working days during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, at the moment, this aspiration is not supported by the whole Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A week with four working days is not the party's policy and is not being taken into account by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to overlook his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to pass power from “anonymous directors” and “beneficiary” to public service firms.
The chancellor’s plans in the shadow also imply that current shareholders in water companies may not take back all of their shares, because the Labour government can carry out a ‘slowdown’ by justifying the actions considered to be violations.
He also confirmed plans to place employees on company boards and to create All Inclusive Property Funds to pass on to employees 10 percent of the private sector firms' capital, which means a dividend paid annually up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy show in "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and raised questions as to whether the findings of the Bureau of Investigation could affect any Republican senator's withdrawal.
In an interview to be broadcast on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could uncover something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open-minded than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said that when I was in the hearing, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I phoned him after this happened, so after the claims came out and I said, "Did you do this?"
He was clear and clear."
Graham's vote, however, seems to be stoned.
"I've split my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and the change would only be a bomb charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham said.
"And everyone she mentioned couldn't verify it.
He's 36 years old.
I don't think it will change anything."
What is the "Global Citizen Festival" and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical show that contains a large and impressive list of stars who play and also have an equally impressive mission; to end poverty in the world.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will expect a crowd of thousands at the Great Lawn in Central Park to not only enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also become aware of the ultimate purpose of the show.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to benefit from a free ticket for the show (except when you want to pay for a VIP ticket), participants must perform a number of duties, or "actions" such as voluntary work, sending an email to a world leader, sending an email to another leader, sending a phone call.
But how successful has the "Global Citizen" Festival been when there are still 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert work a real way to persuade those who seek these interventions, or is it just another case of what's known as "click activism" - people who feel like they're making a real change on a real-life conversation online?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has reportedly recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, giving a boost to various goals.
These actions are said to have helped prompt world leaders to declare <0x24>37 billion in policy commitments, which are said to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 votes and statements as a result of the group's actions, where at least <0x24>10 billion has already been allocated or secured as funds.
The group estimates that the funds insured so far have had a direct impact on around 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key features include "The Power of Nutrition," a partnership of UK-based investors and enforcement agencies, committed to "encouraging children to grow up with their full potential in this 4th place," promising to "end up on the <0x24>35-million dollar loan."
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments, and citizens of the world like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a reminder of the past," the ambassador told The Power of Nutrition in a press release.
The group also said that after taking 5,000 actions to call on the United Kingdom to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government declared funding for a project, "The Power of Nutrition," which will affect five million women's childbirths.
In an answer to the most frequently asked questions on their website, they asked, "What makes you believe that we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded: "It's going to be a long and difficult journey - sometimes we're going to fail and fail.
But like any high-ranking citizen, and as the anti-apartheid movements ahead of us, we will go out because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are some of the actors who will play at this year's New York show, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the navy to "block" Russia's energy exports
"If necessary," Washington could rely on its navy to prevent Russian energy from spreading across the market, including the Middle East, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said in a Washington Examiner quote.
Zinke claims that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate Syrian government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to supply it with energy as they do with Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe," he said.
And according to this official there is a way to deal with this problem.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that sea routes are open and, if necessary, to block them, in order to ensure that energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke is targeting participants in an activity developed by the Energy Consumers Alliance, a non-profit organization that has personified itself as "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He continued to compare Washington's approaches in the treatment of Russia and Iran, noting that these approaches are practically the same.
"Economic opposition to Iran and Russia is a little too much exploitation and replacement of fuels," he said, referring to Russia as "a scam" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statement comes after the Trump administration undertook a mission to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” North Stream 2 gas project, which Trump said has turned Berlin into a “slave” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stated that the <0x24>11 billion Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which is supposed to double the capacity of the existing gas pipeline to carry it to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply made for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the same view that energy cannot be a tool used for pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose the supplier," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow.
The U.S. position has been opposed by Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a lot of problems when a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "think seriously" if she will run for president in 2020, Massachusetts senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "think seriously" to take part in the presidential race after the midterm elections.
During a rally in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider the nomination.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our destroyed government, and this includes putting a woman on top," she told The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will take the presidential nomination seriously."
Warren hit President Donald Trump during a rally in the city, saying he's "guiding the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm terribly concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren is known for her criticism of Trump and his High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a speech on Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that a large proportion of Warren's own voters don't think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' "possible" voters said the senator should not run, according to a poll conducted by the Suffolk/Boston Globe University Political Research Center.
Thirty-two percent supported this proposal.
The poll showed that former governor Deval Patrick enjoyed greater support for the nomination, with 38 percent supporting a possible candidate and 48 percent opposed to the nomination.
Other high-profile Democratic names that have been discussed to race in 2020 include former vice president Joe Biden and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin cited Trak Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder in Donald Trump's meeting
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being summoned to the military in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with an incident of domestic violence.
"What my son is going through, what he's going through after he's back, can connect him to other families who feel the spread of PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers are returning with," she told participants at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Paul called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said that her son and other war veterans, "come slightly altered, hardened, come wondering if they get the proper respect for the soldiers and other aviators of the army, for which country there is."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic violence after an attack on a woman, after a report of domestic violence and gun violence while he was drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support opposition to a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are endorsing a legal opposition to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims who have escaped criminal groups or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and districts filed a document explaining as a friend-to-court on Friday in support of changing asylum-seeking policies, reports NBC News.
The full name of the defendant in the Grace vs Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union deposited in August against federal politics has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and his violent boys members of the gang" abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
It was stopped in Texas.
State lawyers who are supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as countries that produce a high number of asylum seekers in the United States because they are countries that have problems spreading with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum-seeking policy, backed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants to escape domestic violence and apply for asylum.
The District Attorney General of Colombia, General Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international laws."
"Federal laws require all asylum claims to be judged on the specific facts and circumstances of the case, and such a measure is contrary to this principle," the court's friend's report said.
Lawyers further argued in the report that the police's ban on immigrants' entry was damaging the U.S. economy, stating that their chances are to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary wing of work."
Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June not to give asylum to victims who escape domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their country because of fear or persecution based on race, religious belief, nationality or affiliation to a particular social group or political belief," Sessions said on the day of the political declaration.
Asylum was never intended to ease all the problems -- even all the serious ones -- that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue attempts in Paul as the balance of deaths doubles in a race to find a survivor
To the survivors, the situation was very respectable.
"The situation feels quite tense," said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, while keeping her young and sick son in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Paula.
"The ambulance brings the troops every minute.
There's no clean water anymore."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, taking out their items immersed in water, in an effort to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5-ball earthquake are overcrowded.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who had broken his back and shoulder, were placed in the Military Hospital outside of Palu, where patients are being treated in outdoor environments because the earthquakes continue.
His eyes were filled with tears as he remembered when he felt the violent shock of the earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"I didn't have time to save myself.
I think I was pushed under the ruins of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to town for a wedding.
"I heard that the woman was crying and asking for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to him and his son.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of 'Aggression' with 'Propaganda Advertising'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page advertisement in a U.S. daily that promoted the common benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to distribute propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China Daily's paid supplement to Des Moines Register - the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of attempting to interfere in the U.S. congressional elections.
Trump's allegations that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials told Reuters it was a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to increase pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in a growing trade war that has seen tariffs equilibrium over each other's imports.
Chinese and U.S. experts have said China's payment tariffs in this trade war were set to hit exporters in countries such as Yua, which has backed Trump's Republican party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor for a long time in Ioua, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has hit U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
In an opinion published in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, Branstad wrote that, "China is already doubling this harassment by placing propaganda advertisements in our free press."
"By distributing its propaganda, the Chinese government is being helped by the joyful American tradition of free speech and the free press by placing a paid ad on the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, in the street newspaper kiosks here in Beijing, you will find very few voices against and you will not see any real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese may have about China's disturbing economic trajectory," he said.
He added that "some of China's most spicy newspapers avoided the bid to publish his article," despite not telling him which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn Republicans are changing women's voters ahead of midterm elections after the Kavanaugh scandal
The more Republican leading figures solidarize and defend High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, ahead of some sexual assault allegations, analysts have warned that they will face a harsh response, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions on the subject have been very high, and many Republicans have publicly declared that they want to continue voting for the candidate.
These things can't be broken," Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University Maxwell School told 'The Hill' for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts the last-minute attempt by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation and that this will be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget neither tomorrow nor November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive MoveOn group, according to the Washington D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted ‘November is coming!’ as they were demonstrating in the Senate corridors as Republicans who control the Court Committee decided to move forward with Kavanaugh’s nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
"Democrats' enthusiasm and motivation will reach the top," Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news site.
"People are saying it's already been at high levels; that's true.
But it could be even higher, especially among undecided women on the periphery and among young voters aged 18 to 29, who, although they don't like the president, usually don't vote at all."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault against the High Court candidate, analysts suggested there would be a strong reaction if Republicans continued to support the candidate.
“This has turned into a cobbled up mess for the GOP,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the National Committee of Republicans, told NBC News earlier this week.
"It's not just about the vote of the committee or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be placed in the defendant's bank or not, it's also about how the Republicans handled this issue, and the way the Republicans handled it, and the way they handled that woman," he told NBC News.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided on who to believe in the evidence surveillance of Ford and Kavanaugh, with the latter having a slightly higher backing.
A recent survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believe in Ford’s testimony undoubtedly or most likely, while 35 percent say they believe in Kavanaugh.
Also, 38 percent think that Kavanaugh, most likely or undoubtedly, has lied during his testimonial, while only 30 percent say the same thing about Ford.
Following Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently investigating claims made by Ford and other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, under oath, that Kavanaugh attacked him at the age of 17 while he was in a state of drunkenness.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the High Court showed his genitals in front of her while they were at a party while they were studying in Yale, in the 1980s.
The creator of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the founder of the Worldwide Network, is creating a company that aims to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company built from Berners-Lee’s open-source platform, called Solid.
'Solid' allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed to access certain information.
In an exclusive interview for the Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly said that the goal after the Inrupt is "world domination."
"We have to do it now," he said about this innovative company.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create "save their personal data on the network" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, lists of things to do, music lists, and other personal and professional tools.
It's the same as having it available in a browser and at the same time Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify.
What is unique about storing personal data on the network is the fact that it remains entirely in the user's hands about what kind of information it will access.
The company calls this "personal reinforcement through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's CEO, John Bruce, is to bring together the right resources, processes and skills to help Solid be available to anyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased from IBM, several developers hired to work on this project, and a volunteer code community.
Starting from this week, tech developers around the world can create their decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team weren't talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to present a total change where all their business models are completely rebuilt overnight.
"We're not asking for their permission."
Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission "is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the newly built Solid network."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the Worldwide Network Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the network's overlap debate.
While founding Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the Worldwide Network Consortium, the Network Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about this new era of the network," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann celebrates the Victorian Cross's donation during World War I to the clergy
The only clergyman to have won a Victorian Cross during World War I as a warrior has been remembered at his homeland, 100 years later.
Colonel Bernard Vann won the medal on September 29, 1918, in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had won the highest British military title.
A memorial stone was presented by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
Michael Vann said it was "extremely symbolic" to commemorate exactly 100 years of the heroic act that gave the medal to his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the canal of Saint-Quentin "through a dense fog and under the brilliance of bullets from fields and machine guns."
He then hurried to the line of fire and with a "great triad" led the battalion forward and captured one of the weapons in the battlefield and killed only three people from the opposing forces.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions "are something he can never achieve but something that really shows modesty."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, were appointed by a crown behind the parade, which was headed by the Brentwood Imperial Youth group.
Michael Vann said he was "very honored to be a part of this parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is emerging from the support that is being given by many people."
MMA fans stayed awake all night to follow Bellator 206, but instead saw "Pepa Dry."
Imagine, you've been awake all night to watch Bellator 206, and then you're off the chance to see this major event.
The show from San Jose contained 13 dylufties, including six dylufties in the base package and would be shown in real time overnight on channel 5, in MB.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Moussasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in Britain were surprised when the broadcast changed to show Derrkucen Pepa.
Some were dissatisfied after staying awake all night until the first hours, especially for this game.
A Twitter fan described the move from the game to a children's cartoon as "a ugly joke."
"It is the government's rules that determine that at 6 a.m. that content was not appropriate for it and we should move on to a children's program," said Dave Schwartz, vice president of marketing and communication at Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
"Pep's Derrick," he said.
Bellator's president Scott Coker said they will work on the programming to include viewers from the UK in the future.
"When I think about retransmission, I think I can solve it," Coker said.
"But there are six o'clock in the morning, Sunday, and we won't be able to solve this problem until Sunday with our clock, so Monday with their clock.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, when the program was changed there were many messages circulating and none of them was friendly.
We were trying to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen next time.
"We're going to do the show with 5 games in sixth place - as we usually do - we tried to give more for the fans and maybe we've outstripped the leg.
It's a bad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels 'Inferior' About His Sexuality
Olympic wrestler Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality - but this gave him motivation to achieve success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't understand until he went to school at the age of nine that "not everyone was like me."
Speaking on the first Radio 4 show of Desert Island Discs, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he raised his voice for gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that after becoming a parent, he thought less about winning Olympic medals.
Kirsty Young, the permanent presenter of the long-term program, has taken a few months off because she is ill.
Appearing as a person distracted in Laverne's first program, Daley said that as he grew up he felt "inferior" to others because "it was not socially acceptable for boys and girls to be liked."
"Until today, those feelings of inferiority, and the fact that I felt differently, were the real elements that gave me the push and the strength to get out of it."
He wanted to prove that it was worth "something," he said, not to disappoint everyone when they heard about his sexual orientation.
Twice the winner of the bronze Olympic medal, he is already a high-profile LGBT activist with a high profile and used his participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to legitimize homosexuality.
He said he came out open because he felt lucky that he was able to live open and without consequences and that he wanted to give others "hope."
Three times the world champion said that falling in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "has caught me unprepared."
Last year, Daley married Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When he experiences so many things at such a young age" - he went to the first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone at the same age who had experienced the same symptoms.
The couple became parents in June of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that his "whole perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, all I thought was 'I have to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know what, there's more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
"My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with head cancer.
Daley said his father did not admit he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if we had tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the first row.
“I can’t tell you that you can’t be in the first row,” he said.
"I was holding his hand while he was still breathing and only after he was breathing and he changed his life and accepted for the first time that and he was not irresistible," he said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of the local audience at the Olympics, it didn't feel any better," he said.
Also, this inspired his first musical selection - Proud of Heather Small - that accompanied him during the preparations for the Olympics and continues to inspire Mornica.
Desert Island Discs will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m.
Mickelson, out of shape, was left on the table Saturday at the Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to change his shape in order not to turn this historic moment into a disappointing one.
Mickelson, for the 12th time participating in this event, a record for himself, which is held every two years, was left on the table by captain Jim Furyk, during the duel (fourballs and foursomes).
Instead of being at the center of the action, as it has always been for the United States, the top five-time winner spent the day supporting the team and working in hopes of leaving behind the concerns.
Not among the right-hit players even when he was at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not a suitable player for the complicated field of Le Golf National, where long and difficult fields do not leave room for wrong shots.
And if not just the fear of the field, Mickelson on Sunday, in the ninth game will face ‘British Open’ champion Francesco Molinari, who has formed a team with starter Tommy Fleetwood to win their four games this week.
If the Americans, who have four points less, before the start of the 12 playoffs, start it drastically, Mickelson's game can be decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, even though he can't say more than that.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a shoulder stroke, threw his hand on my neck and told me it would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's in the Hall of Fame and he's made a lot of contributions to these teams in the past, and during this week.
I didn't think he would play two games.
I had thought more, but in the end it turned out so I thought it was the solution.
He wants to be on the field like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for the player with the most appearances in the Ryder Cup matches.
He can mark the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, where he has not been at the height of his individual performances.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk said his presence brings value to the team.
"He's gassy, sarcastic, sharp, he likes to harass people, and he's a fantastic guy to have in the team room," he said.
"Also, I think the younger players were having fun dealing with him this week, and that was nice to see.
It's more than just a game."
The captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, knows that the great leader could disappear too soon.
"Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows from experience that the considerable lead ahead of the final day of the Ryder Cup, can turn into an unpleasant factor.
Danez made his debut in 1997 in Valderrama, where the team with captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead against the Americans and closed the tournament by winning with an overly narrow difference, 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"It repeats to itself that we had a great lead in Valderrama; we had a great lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won but with a lot of difficulty," said Bjorn, who was photographed after not seeing a 5-3 win in Class 2018.
So the story tells me and everyone in that team that it's not over.
Tomorrow we're going to take the last step.
We're going there and we're going to do the right thing.
Nothing's over until we get the points in the table.
We have a goal, to try to win this trophy, and here is our focus.
"I've said it all the time, I'm focused on the 12 players we have on the team, but we're aware of who we're facing - the best players in the world."
Satisfied with the performance of his players, in a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I don't want to rush at this stage.
Tomorrow we’ll face another “reward.”
Tomorrow we're going to showcase individual performances, and that's something else to do.
It's great when you're on the field with a partner, when things go well, but when you're alone, then you're tested at your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message you need to convey to the players, tomorrow you need to give the best of yourself.
Now, forget the partner after and he has to go and give the best of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will hope his players perform better individually than their partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, taking three out of four possible points.
Furyk himself has experienced both major returns on the last day, being part of the winning team in Brooklyn before losing to what is considered the "Miracle in Medina" of the European team.
"I remember every word," when asked how he motivated his players on the last day of Captain Ben Crenshaw in 1999.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we need to have a good start, as you saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
When you take a run on one side, you put a lot of pressure on the midfielders.
"We've set the training based on this and we're going to bring the boys to the ranking that we believe is the best, once you understand, we're trying to achieve a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas is tasked to start overturning the result and will face Rory McIlroy in the lead match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter will face European players in the first half of the new season.
"I've forgotten this group and in this rank I believe it covers all the way to the game," Bjorn said.
The production of the new German war has been postponed.
The new German naval fleet should have been sent in 2014 to replace the Cold War battles, but will not be ready until at least next year due to problematic systems and fairly high costs, local media reported.
The shipment of Rhineland-Palatinate, the main ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman.
The ship is expected to join the Navy in 2014, but the problems after the shipment damaged the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
The center is known to contain a powerful ball, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft missiles and anti-stealth technology, such as radar detection reduction, infrared and acoustic waves.
Some of the other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible for new frigates to be moved for more than two years away from the country's ports.
However, the continuing delays mean that the latest technological struggles - which are said to enable Germany to reflect power overseas - will be obsolete at the time they enter service, writes Die Zeit.
The F125 was launched last year, when the German navy officially rejected the order for the ship and returned it to the sea shipyard of Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time Marina returned a ship to its builder after its delivery.
There was little information on the reasons for the return, but German media cited a series of "major software and hardware defects" that rendered the ship useless during a war mission.
The problems in programming were particularly important on the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships because they would be operated by a crew of 120 sailors - as much as half of the workforce of the old Bremen class frigates.
It was also found that the ship was very overweight, which reduced its performance and limited the Navy's ability to add improvements in the future.
The 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate is believed to be twice the weight of ships of the same category used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the physical parts with problems, the price of the entire project - including the training of the crew - is also turning into a problem.
It is said to have reached a figure of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0x24>3.6 billion) - out of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion originally projected.
The problems faced by the new frigates are becoming especially important after recent warnings that the German navy's strength is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee in the German parliament, admitted that the Navy was "completing suitable ships to relocate to another country."
The official said the problem was added over time because the old ships were out of use but were not replaced with new ones.
He said with regret that none of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates would be able to join the navy.
The National Trust monitors the secret lives of the naked at night.
A new research, which is being developed by a company in Scotland's mountainous areas, is aimed at finding out how the naked people of the night use the ground to hunt for food.
It is hoped that the new findings will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and will help protective activities in the future.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the usual night nudes and those called pipistrelles soprano as well as the ears-length coffee and Daubenton nudes in the Inverewe gardens, in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment will be placed at key points throughout the area to track the activities of the nudists throughout the entire season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct field studies using handheld detectors.
The sound analysis that will be carried out by experts for all recordings will determine the frequency of nude sounds and what each species does.
Thereafter, a report and a map of their habitat will be drawn up to give a detailed overview of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Protection Advisor, hopes that the findings will show which habitats are most important to the nude and how they are used by each species.
This information would help determine the good of the administration of settlements, such as the creation of hedges and how to preserve forests for night-nudes and other related species.
The number of night-time nudists in Scotland and throughout the UK has fallen sharply over the past century.
They are under the threat of construction and developmental work that has an impact on fauna and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose hazards, such as adhesive sheets or chemical components of building materials, as well as attacks of pets.
In fact, the nakedness of the night is not blind.
However, due to their hunting habits during the night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching the eyebrows.
They use a sophisticated location-finding technique through sounds to accurately determine insects and flight obstacles.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes very seriously the nudity of the night.
There are ten trained experts, who regularly conduct studies, speech inspections, and are sometimes involved in rescue programs.
The organization has even raised the first and only Scottish reserve dedicated to night nudes in Threave, Dumfries and Galloway, which serves as home to eight out of ten species of night nudes in Scotland.
The administrator of this reserve, David Thompson, says this country is the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Threave we have an excellent area for the nakedness of the night," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the right habitat.
But there's still a lot of things about the nakedness of the night that remain unknown, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand more about what they need to 'develop'."
He stresses the importance of carrying out night-time nudity checks prior to carrying out property maintenance work because there is a possibility that the unintentional destruction of a hamlet could kill up to 400 women and young night-nudes by destroying one area and thus destroying populations.
The nakedness of the night is protected and killing, harassing and disturbing them or destroying their speech is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish worker at the Trust for the Conservation of Nude Nights, encourages people to become part of the aid.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our nightclubs and many of our species, we just don't know how their population is moving."
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape, while lawyers are preparing to publish German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo said the allegations of rape against him were "fake news," saying people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are set to publish the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published these allegations.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus has been charged with raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
On Friday, Der Spiegel reported that he later allegedly paid her <0x24>375,000 not to mention the incident.
Speaking in a live video on Instagram, directed at 142 million of his followers, just hours after these claims were released, 33-year-old Ronaldo considered the reports as "fake news."
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
What he said today is fake news," the Golden Ball winner said five times in front of the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's going well," the player added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to ask Der Spiegel for these allegations, which they have called “unacceptable reports of suspicions about privacy.”
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral disasters at a value corresponding to the seriousness of the violation, which is perhaps one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 at a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed at Clark County Court, Nevada, after meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga are said to have gone to the player's room, where he allegedly raped him in the anus.
The mayor claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and said that "99 percent" he is a "good guy" left in the mud by "one percent."
The document says Ronaldo confirms that the couple had sexual intercourse but that it was with both sides' consent.
The mayor also claims she went to the police and had photos of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court solution because she was "horrified by revenge" and worried that she would be "publicly bullied."
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to return the deal because she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was close to joining Real Madrid by Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer passed to Italian Juventus giants in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'will forever regret' the loss of automotive makers' status
The UK "will regret forever" if it loses its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "concerning" that Toyota in the UK had told the BBC that if Britain would leave the EU without an agreement, the company would temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of a delay at the border, in the event of a no-deal exit, would cost the loss of jobs.
The factory in Burnaston - which produces the Toyota Auris and Avensis models - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other countries of the European Union.
"In my judgment, in the event that Britain leaves the EU by the end of March, we will stop production at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's executive director in Burnaston.
Other carmakers at MB, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also expressed fears of leaving the EU without a deal and how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, said that after Brexit it would close its Mini series factory for a month.
The main concerns are related to what car makers refer to as supply chain hazards in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on an "immediately as soon as ordered," with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers from MB and the EU, for custom machines.
If, on March 29, MB leaves the EU without an agreement, there may be delays in the limits which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep the inventory at its Derbyshire factory for more than a day, the company said, and the production will stop.
Clark said Theresa May's 'Chequers' plan for future relations with the EU "was built specifically to avoid these border checks."
"We need a deal. We want to have the best deal that will allow us not only to enjoy the success of the moment but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4.
"The data, not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, shows that we must certainly be able to continue what has been a fairly successful supply chain."
Toyota could not determine how long it would stop production, but in the long run, it warned that the increased costs would lower the factory's competitiveness and consequently lead to a reduction in jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a senior official of the Unite trade union at the factory, said members are increasingly concerned: "According to my experience at the moment these jobs are closed, they don't return.
A government spokesman said: "We have set a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, the White House says
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed even for a week" as the fight for High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's interference in the election, the ties between Trump's assistant staff and Russia, and the possibility that the president has obstructed justice.
The debate whether Trump will oust the Deputy Attorney General from office, thereby jeopardizing Mueller's independence, is something that has created rumors for months in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had taken into account a spokesman's position to record talks with Trump and the possibility of the president's dismissal through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied this news.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, among reports that he was about to resign.
In contrast to what was expected, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was at the United Nations headquarters in New York.
Trump said he "would prefer" not to dismiss Rosenstein, but later the meeting was pushed to avoid a clash with the hearing held by the Senate jury committee, where Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of having sex, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, postponing the full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was present on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "It's not yet set a date, it could be this week. I think it could be postponed another week considering everything else that's going on with the High Court.
But let's see, and I always like to keep the press up-to-date."
Some journalists may object to this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Moderator Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences did not come as a result of dissatisfaction with the position of television journalists, although she said, "I would not deny the fact that they attract attention."
Later, it was realized that there would be increased direct contact between Trump and the press.
"The president conducts more sessions of quality assurance than any other president before him," she said, adding, without quoting data: "We have seen these figures."
There will continue to be a press conference, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, then it's much better than talking to me.
"We're trying to do this often, and you've seen that we've done it often over the last few weeks, replacing press conferences where you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends open sessions, or press conferences with important personalities.
Individual press conferences are rare.
The president may have pointed out the reason for this fact, during this week in New York, where he made a controversial and in some strange cases, in front of journalists.
The Secretary of Health writes to EU employees at NHS Scotland about fears about Brexit.
The health secretary has written to the EU staff working at the NHS in Scotland to express her gratitude on behalf of the country and her desire to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish parliament, has sent a letter after less than six months of the MB's departure from the EU.
The Scottish government has already taken over the cost of applying for permanent resident status for EU citizens working in public services at the local level.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations have continued for the removal of MB from the EU, approaching a decision in the autumn.
But the MB government has also intensified its preparations in the case of a non-agreement scenario.
I know this is a very worrying time for all of you.
For this reason, I wanted to emphasize how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that increase and improve the work of healthcare, by increasing the benefits of the patients and communities that we serve.
"Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgical intervention after a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie underwent immediate surgical intervention following a head injury on Saturday, in a 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodores, The Tennessean reporter Mike Organ.
Tennessee State Coach Rod Reed told reporters that the damage occurred just before the first part.
"He came to the side line and fell there," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen in the side line before placing it in the barrel and sending it for further examinations.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville that Abercrombie had completed surgery at Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that "there's still no details on the type/scale of the damage" and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five interceptions on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing the total number of interceptions during the season to 18.
Foreign buyers will pay higher chicken tax when they buy a property in MB.
Foreign buyers will pay higher chicken tax for buying a property in MB and additional money will be used to help homeless people according to the Conservative Party's new plans (Tory)
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's initiative to attract new voters.
The tax will apply to those who do not pay the tax in MB.
The Treasury Department expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that buyers with foreign nationality will pay higher chicken tax for buying a property in MB and additional money will be used to help homeless people.
This move will be seen as an effort to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters with promises to offer more affordable housing and to "focus" people with high earnings.
The pulley tax will be applied to individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in MB, while the additional money will support the government's initiative to combat the lack of shelter.
This extra fee - which is added to the current poultry tax, including the increase in the tax rate introduced two years ago for second homes and for properties purchased for rent - can go up to three percent.
The Treasury Department predicts that this move will accumulate up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
Approximately 13 percent of London's newly built properties are bought by people living outside the UK, causing price rises and making it harder for buyers to find shelter for the first time.
Many rich areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "fantasy cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a drop in poultry tax to help young people buy their first home.
He accused major construction firms of keeping their prices high by buying land but not putting it into use, and called on Ms. May to give up quotas for affordable homes, in order to regulate the "British tour of properties."
Mr. Corbyn has proposed several attractive reforms for shelter, including the control of rentals and the removal of "unreasonable" departures.
Also, he wants to give more power to the tips to build new homes.
Ms. May said: "Last year I announced that I would dedicate this to the Prime Minister's mandate of returning the British dream - that is, for a better life for every new generation.
And that means fixing the problem-solving home market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it's not fair that individuals who don't live in MB and foreign companies have it easier to buy homes than British workers.
For many people, the dream of owning a house has become too difficult to achieve and the injustice to the homeless is more than real.
Jack Ross: "My biggest ambition is to train Scotland"
Sunderland coach Jack Ross says "his greatest ambition" is to become Scotland's coach at a certain stage.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is enjoying the challenge of restoring the North-West club, which currently ranks third in the League One (category 3), three points away from the head.
He came to the Light Stadium this summer after returning St Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
"I've been to Representative B once, and that's all," Ross told BBC Scotland Sportssound.
"But as a child I grew up seeing Scotland in Hampden many times with my father, and it's something that has always attracted me.
However, this opportunity will only come if I'm successful in the direction of clubs."
Ross' predecessors to Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic coach says he's not worried he's following the footsteps of these big names at such a big club, as he has previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At the moment, my success will depend on whether I can bring this team back to the Premier League.
"Given the structure and environment of this club, it certainly has its place in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to go there, but I would only see myself as successful if I could get the club back in the Premier League."
Ross has only started his coaching career for three years after a period as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and a 15-month period at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa climb a higher category to the third round of the cup, as well as transformed St Mirren from a club near the fall from the category to the championship title winners next season.
And now, Ross says he feels better than he ever felt during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"Maybe it was really a turning point," he says, for taking Alloa's lead.
"I really believed that training was the right thing for me, rather than being a player.
It looks strange because I played well, I made a good life thanks to this profession, and I enjoyed some good achievements.
But being a player can be very difficult.
You have to experience a lot of things every week.
Again, I experience a lot of stress and pressure from work but training seems to be the right thing to do.
I've always wanted to train and now I'm doing something like that. I've never been so good and so myself in my whole life as an adult."
The full interview can be heard on Sunday, September 30, at Sportsound, on Radio Scotland from 12:00 to 13:00 BST.
According to a study, the perfect time to "drink a beer" is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat wave has increased local revenues in the UK's tough situation, but has increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The data shows that sales in local groups and bars grew by 2.7 percent in July - but shopping in restaurants fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, CGA's business consultant, who compiled the data, said: "Continuous weather in the sun as well as England's participation in the World Cup for longer than expected influenced July to follow the same trend as June, where sales of restaurants increased as much as June.
Giros in restaurants fell by 1.8% in June, and worsened even further in July.
Bars and premises with major drinking activities recorded the best performance, with higher growth than the reduction of trade in restaurants.
The premises with the main food supply also recognized a decline as a result of the sunny weather, although not as significant as restaurants.
It looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
Sales of beverages in bars and locals increased by 6.6 percent that month, while food fell by 3 percent."
Paul Newman, RSM's leisure and hospitality analyst, said: "These results confirm the trend we have seen since the end of April.
When it comes to sales in the non-home market, the weather and impact of important social or sporting events remain the main factors.
It's no surprise that restaurant groups continue to get into trouble, although a 4.8 percent annual sales drop will have a particularly heavy burden given the ongoing cost pressure.
The long and hot summer could not come at a more difficult time for food operators and the weather will show if the average temperatures in August will give the desired calm."
Total sales growth in local and restaurants, including those just opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in the launch of brands.
The Coffer Peach industry sales tracking index, for the MB bars and restaurants sector, collects and analyzes data from 47 companies, with a total turnover of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and is the industry's benchmark.
One in five children have hidden accounts on social media that they hide from their parents.
According to one study, one in five children - some of whom are not more than 11 years old - have hidden accounts on social media that they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 nine-year-old students showed an increase in "fake Insta" profiles
This news has increased the fear of posts with sexual content.
Twenty percent of students say they have a "main" account that shows them to their parents.
One in five children - some of whom are not more than 11 years old - are opening an account on social media, which is used by adults in secret.
A survey of 20,000 nine-year-old education students showed a rapid increase in "fake Insta" profiles - linked to the photo sharing page, Instagram.
This news has increased the fear of posts with sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they use a clean "main" account that shows them to their parents, but they also have private accounts.
A mother, who accidentally uncovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, found that a teenager encouraged others to "rape her."
The Digital Awareness UK study and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles, and half of them admitted they had secret accounts.
HMC CEO Mike Buchanan said: "It's troubling that so many teenagers are trying to create social spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of athletes" on the Scottish Athletics Board
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Board of Athletics in Scotland, as the non-executive director of this governing body, during the annual meeting of the General Assembly.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete of the tracks and fields and Mayor Ian Beattie described this decision as a great opportunity for all sports executives to benefit from her extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys massive respect in the athletics community in Scotland, MB and the world and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit immensely by making it part of the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I'm excited to serve as the voice of athletes and I very much hope that I will contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200m and 400m race at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, with four Olympic gold medals in total and who is a regular expert at the BBC, lost the ability to walk after a temporary ischemic strike.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I can't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell me if I will recover and to what extent.
It took a shocking job but here I came out to fully recover, I learned to walk again and I'm doing skill exercises today!
"Thank you for encouraging messages!"
Breast pump advertising comparing mothers to cows shares public opinion
A breast pump manufacturing company has shared public opinion with an advertisement comparing breastfeeding mothers with cow milling.
To start promoting what is considered "the world's first no-noise and wearable breast pump," consumer technology product company Elvie showed a gas music video, to promote the freedom that this new pump gives to mothers who need it again.
Four true mothers dance in a cow's rack filled with bars under the sounds of a song with the following lyrics: "Yeah, I'm drowning myself, but I don't have a bite" and "If you haven't noticed, these aren't sissy, it's my chest."
Refreni continues: "Pumps, pumps, after feeding baby boiled, pumps, pumps, after honey boiled."
However, the ad, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, has sparked online debate.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received friendly feedback from viewers, many of whom are said to underestimate the "terrors" of the dairy industry.
"Using cows to advertise this product is a very poor decision.
Just like us, they need to be "pregnant" and "ladder" to produce milk, only that their "babys" get from them a few days after they give birth," someone wrote.
Elvie's breast pump is placed inside recipes and doesn't fall into the eye (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "It's very traumatic for the mother and the child.
Why don't we use it to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "What kind of advertising without sensitivity."
Others supported the advertisement, among which a woman admitted that the song seemed "to be funny."
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one if you were still feeding the baby with breastfeeding.
It made me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I've seen what it means.
"It's a great product," someone wrote.
Another commented: "This is a gas advertisement that targets mothers who use the pump (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and who feel like "balls."
This is not an advertisement that evaluates or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women shows that they've all danced with the "secret" pump placed in the recipes.
The concept behind this campaign is based on the fact that many women who use breast pumps say they feel like a cow.
However, the Elvie pump is noisy, has no wires or tubes, is placed inside the recipes and does not fall into the eye, giving women the freedom to move, holding their babies, and even going out while using it.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD (Executive Creative Director) at Mother commented: "The Elvis pump is a product so revolutionary that it deserved a bold and provocative promotion.
Making a parallel between women who want to express themselves freely and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight the use of breast pump and the challenges they face, also displaying in a fun and similar way the extraordinary sense of smell.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has come out on the front page.
During the fashion week in London, a mother of two children appeared on the portal of stylists Marta Jakubowski using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have been quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of banned migrant children has increased even though the monthly number of crossings at the border has remained relatively the same, in part as a result of the rhetoric and strict policies presented by the Trump administration that have made it difficult to send children to their supporters.
Typically, most of the supporters have also been immigrants without documents themselves, and have been afraid to risk their stay in the country trying to apply for a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential supporters and other adults of the same family would have to give fingerprints, and this data would also be passed on to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Agency, testified in front of Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people, who had applied to support the detainees.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had no criminal record.
"About 80 percent of individuals who are supporters or members of the family of supporters remain in the country illegally, and a large part of them are foreigners with criminal precedents.
So, we're continuing to follow these individuals," said Mr. Albence.
According to the shelter staff, attempting to process children's data faster, officials introduced new rules that required some of them to appear in court within a month of the ban, and not 60 days later, as was the norm.
Many of them will appear before immigration judges through video conferences and not physically, to argue their request for obtaining legal status.
Those who do not qualify will be deported immediately.
According to shelter workers and reports taken from the system in recent months, the longer children stay banned, the more likely they are to feel anxious or fall into depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
Supporters say these concerns are more pronounced in larger environments such as Tornillo, where, due to its size, there are more likely to be signs that a child has difficulty.
They add that moving children to the tent city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends, can cause trauma that many of them are already facing.
Syria calls on U.S., French and Turkish 'occupied forces' to withdraw immediately
During his speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country has already begun in the eighth year.
Moualem, who also holds the post of deputy prime minister, said foreign forces remain on Syrian soil illegally, with the pretext that they fight terrorism, and that they "will act with them in the right way."
"They must be withdrawn immediately and unconditionally," he said during the assembly.
Moualem insisted that "the war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions more have been expelled from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight in this holy battle until we have cleared all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and "foreign forces."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the territory of this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said the conditions are good for them to return, and blamed "a number of western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" that push refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return," he said.
"They're politicizing a matter that needs to be completely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide aid for Syria's reconstruction until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral zone at the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created an opportunity to move forward with political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in this province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem noted that the deal had "clear instructions" and expressed confidence that military attacks would target jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who "will be destroyed."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meeting of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem presented the conditions for the government's participation in this committee, saying the panel's work should be limited "to revising the current constitution," and warned there should be no interference.
Why Trump will win a second term.
According to this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many people with liberal views hope, the accusations and scandals end his presidency prematurely.
In what would be undoubtedly "The most dramatic found of a presidency in history!"
So far, there are no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the number of viewers during the peak hour has doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average viewership of 2.4 million over the peak hour, out of 1.7 million four years ago, while MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" program has reached the top rating of cable channels with 3.5 million viewers during major events.
"This is a fire to which people are drawn because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, director of the ABC drama series Designated Survivor, which tells the story of a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an old comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
It reminds me of a taxi ride to Boston ahead of the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was voting for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He replied, "Because you make me laugh," Mrs. Scovell told me.
There's a lot of fun in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories coming from Washington can determine Roe v. Wade's future, whether migrant families can join and the health of the global economy.
Ignorance is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can face.
And yet, if you find yourself after six hours of watching a panel of experts debating Bob Woodward's use of "unacceptable information" in his book "Fear," Paul Manafort's bomber jacket with struts of leather, was worth <0x24>15,000 for the Post, a briefcase, and a piece of Daniel's stuffed stock.
At least I'll never see Super Mario again in the same way.
"Part of what he does and that makes it look like a 'reality show' is that you're fed up with something every night," said Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about the actors who circulate, develop, and develop.

When I went to Mr. Fleiss this week, the time was sunshine and the temperature outside was 80 degrees, outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he was hiding inside, watching MSNBC, while recording CNN.
He couldn't leave, not while Brett Kavanaugh would face the Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court that depended on peripheral threads.
"I remember when we performed all those crazy programs in the past and the people who said, 'This is the last beginning of Western civilization,'" Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right."

Money from outside the private sector flows into a tight race for Congress elections
It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district is facing a cash outburst, as a result of the reorganization of the electoral zones that forces two officials to compete for the same post.
This recent reorganization in the outskirts of Pittsburgh, has appointed Democratic representative Conor Lamb - who won the post in another area, in special elections, last spring.
Lamb is running against another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th area of Pennsylvania, which has been reassigned to the new 17th area.
This new division of maps came after a decision by the Pennsylvania High Court, which, in January, stated that the old areas had been assigned inconsistently and unfairly in favor of Republicans.
This race, in the new area 17, has also spurred a strong confrontation in campaign funding from the main party funding bodies, the Democratic Committee for Congressional Campaigns (DCCC) and the Republican National Committee for Campaigns (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a narrow-run victory in the March election, which was followed extensively, for Pennsylvania's 18th election zone.
For more than a decade, the post was held by Republicans and President Donald Trump won the area by 20 points.
Politicians see Democrats as their favorites.
The U.S. is considering penalizing El Salvador for supporting China, and then withdrawing.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little pressure from Washington.
Trump had a hot meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until his partners expelled the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials have decided to remove U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan," Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement.
But the penalties were only considered against El Salvador, who received some <0x24>140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including reductions in financial aid and certain restrictions on visa granting, would be severe for the country of Central America and its high levels of unemployment and murders.
As internal meetings progressed, officials from North and Central America pushed a high-level conference focusing on security and economic well-being to follow a similar meeting last year, an action that was considered a step forward in the efforts to advance migrants.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear they wanted the conference to take place, giving them every opportunity to impose penalties on El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has planned to hold a speech at the conference, which is scheduled for mid-October, a sign that shows the importance of the administration's cost to the meeting, the diplomats said.
And the three American envoys returned quietly from El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without strong messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House official for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about internal discussions, subject to their anonymity.
Their explanations were confirmed by an analyst near the administration, who also spoke, seeking the right to anonymity.
Study the history.
The next event that is expected to happen may be the report by special prosecutor Robert Mueller on a possible blockade by Mr Trump, for which there is considerable evidence in public data.
It is reported that Mr. Mueller is shifting his investigation to verify that during his campaign, Mr. Trump has cooperated with Russia in attacking our elections.
If Congress changes sides, Mr. Trump will have to account for this body at a time when he is preparing to go out before voters again, and perhaps eventually face an independent jury.
This is a lot if, and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall - or that of his counterparts in Europe - is inevitable.
All of us, from both sides of the Atlantic, must make choices that will influence how long the conflict will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to take the state on Hitler, if the West had resisted and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, and we lost the opportunity to avoid the following years of massacre.
The course of history depends on these turning points, which accelerate or delay the impenetrable course of democracy.
Currently, the Americans are facing some of these turning points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who checks the fate of the investigation against Mr. Mueller?
Rosenstein hasn't been in a difficult situation since the newspaper reported, during last year, that he had suggested to be secretly heard by the president, and had speculated that he was not fit to stay in office.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times article is not accurate.
"How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the F.B.I. on Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or right - or if it is confirmed in the High Court despite the grounded allegations of sexual assault and false evidence?
And above all, will we vote in the upcoming elections for a Congress that will consider Mr. Trump responsible?
If we fail in these tests, then democracy will face a long winter.
But I don't think we're going to fail because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia, who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied the ambassador's residence where I lived.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light the Sabbath candle on that table that holds the symbol of the swastika (broken cross).
With this legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Rangers player Graham Dorrans is optimistic ahead of Rapid Vienna
On Thursday, the Rangers awaited Rapid Vienna knowing that a win against the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, would put them in a favourable position to qualify for Group G, the European League.
A knee injury did not allow midfielder Graham Dorrans to make his first appearance this season in a 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers could use that result as a push to achieve bigger things.
"It was an important point for us because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We entered the field believing that we could get something and went out with a point.
Maybe we could have scored in the end, but, in general, I believe the equalization was a fair result.
Maybe they were better in the first part while we showed up in the second part and we were the best team.
On Thursday, it's going to be another big European night.
"I hope we can get three points but it will be a difficult game because they have achieved a positive result in their last game, but with the fans who support us, I'm sure we can move forward and get a positive result.
"Last year was very difficult, due to injuries and changes in the club but now there is a factor of optimism in this team.
The team is good and the boys are enjoying this a lot; the training goes well.
"I hope we can move forward, put it behind our backs last season and achieve success."
Women sleep less as a result of fear of retirement savings
Although the study participants had a clear idea of how we wanted family members to take care of them, very few people spoke to them about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they were talking to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent of respondents said they were talking to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't talk about it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Life Insurance Society, Nationwide.
Here's where we have to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family to take care of you if you don't show your wishes first.
Work with the counselor and with your family and discuss where and how to benefit from care, as these choices can be an important factor in determining costs.
Get your financial advisor as well: The advisor can help you find a way to pay for your expenses.
Long-term care financing options include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with savings to help cover these expenses or self-insurance through your asset - as long as you have money.
Prepare legal documents: Avoid legal battles through an authorization.
Get a health care prosecutor and appoint a trusted person who will supervise your health care and ensure that experts act in accordance with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider getting a prosecutor for your finances.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions on your behalf and guarantee the payment of invoices if you can't do it yourself.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about allergies and medications you take?
Prepare a written plan with these details so that you're ready.
"Not only the financial aspect is at stake, but also who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medications are you going to use?"
Who will take care of the dog?
Prepare this plan."
A man shot several times with an air gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle as he went home after spending the night outside.
The victim, about 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Police officials said it was an "accidental act" that occurred around 2:30 p.m.
The victim did not see the aggressor.
The arrests are not life-threatening and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, while the number of deaths is expected to increase.
With off-the-shelf communications networks, assistance workers have not been able to retrieve information from the Donggala region, an area north of Palu, which was closest to the earthquake epicenter of magnitude 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Below are some facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bridge on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of about 379,800, in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a regency that extends over 300 km (180 miles) along the coastline to the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
Regenca, a smaller administrative region than the province, had a population estimated at about 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and fishing are the main economic activities of the province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the other side of the Sulawesi coast.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency, Palu and Donggala have been hit several times by the tsunami over the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, another tsunami struck the western part of Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the semantic area of the Ring of Fire in the Pacific Ocean and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Below you will find some of the biggest earthquakes and earthquakes of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a powerful earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, in the northern part of Sumatra, caused a tsunami that hit 14 states, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, including Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds lost their lives on Nias Island, on the Sumatra coast.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that crashed on the south coast and killed some 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 strikes near the city of Padang, the capital of the western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-mile earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai, in Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters in height that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A tsunami struck the Pidie Jaya region in Aceh, bringing devastation and panic to people after recalling the devastation caused by the 2004 earthquake and deadly tsunami.
This time, there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people lost their lives in the building crash.
2018: Powerful earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and deputy presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of aggression.
According to a report submitted Saturday by Alaska state police, 29-year-old Paul, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested as a suspect for domestic violence, for preventing reports of domestic violence, and for refusing arrest.
According to the police report, when a woman, his acquaintance, tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he received the phone.
Paul is being held in the Mat-Su pre-trial and is being held a <0x24>500 unsecured bond guarantee, KTUU reported.
According to the network's reports, he was brought to court on Saturday and when asked about his acknowledgment of guilt, he stated that he was "absolutely innocent".
Paul faced three A-class violations, which means he could be imprisoned for up to a year and fined <0x24>250,000.
He was also charged with a category B violation, which is sentenced to one day in prison and <0x24>2,000 fine.
This is not the first time a criminal case has been filed against Paul.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Paul.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently being dealt with by the Alaska Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, preventing reports of domestic violence, and gunning in a drunken state during the incident.
His girlfriend claimed that he had hit him in the face with a fist.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups for linking her son's violent behavior to PTSD (post-traumatic stress syndrome) as a result of service in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people lost their lives on Friday as a result of an earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The magnitude 7.5 quake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are out of service and the number of dead is expected to increase over the next few days.
The quake struck the central part of Sulawesi, located northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
There are videos on social media that show the moment of the shooting.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutors Call for Rare Death Penalty for Suspected Terrorist Attack in NYC
Federal prosecutors in New York City but demand the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspected terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people - a rare punishment not given for a federal crime since 1953.
In October, 30-year-old Saipov is believed to have used a rented Home Depot truck to carry out the terrorist attack on a bicycle road along the western highway in lower Manhattan, breaking pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must certify that Saipov has killed "intentionally" the eight victims and that he has caused "intentionally" serious bodily injuries, according to the letter of intent to seek the death penalty, filed in the southern district of New York.
According to a court document, both of these charges can be sentenced to death.
A few weeks after the attack, a major federal jury put Saipov on 22 charges, including eight charges of murder in support of organized crime, charges often used by prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack came as a result of "a considerable and deliberate planning," the prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov executed the crime as "horrible, ugly and immoral."
"Sayfullo Habibulaevic Saipov caused injuries, injuries, and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erliy, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been over a decade since the last time New York's southern district criminally pursued a case with the death penalty.
The unfaithful Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers but was sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was used in a federal case in New York, was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy and espionage for the benefit of the Soviet Union, two years before the Flood War.
They were both executed in electric chairs on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, of Uzbek nationality, did not show remorse for days and months after the attack.
He told investigators he was feeling good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after he saw ISIS video on his cell phone.
Police said he had also asked to place the flag of ISIS in his hospital room.
He said he was innocent for 22 days.
David Patton, one of the public lawyers representing Saipov, said they were "very disappointed with the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty and not accepting the guilt associated with life imprisonment without appeal will further increase the trauma caused by these events to all people involved," Patton said in a statement.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative Party MP Nigel Farage says he should be at the forefront of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today promised, during a protest at the Conservative conference, that he would "mobilize the army of the people."
The former UKIP leader said politicians should "exit the pressure" of Euroscepticism - after one of Theresa May's deputies suggested that he should be at the forefront of negotiations with the EU.
In March, Conservative MP Peter Bone said in Birmingham that MB 'would be out' if Brexit secretary was Mr Farage.
But the challenge Mrs. May faces to join her group, has been highlighted by the pro-EU stay conservatives, who joined you another protest in the city against Brexit.
The prime minister is having difficulty implementing the Chequers compromise plan, between attacks coming from those who want to stay or leave the European Union, as well as from the EU itself.
The Allies insist that it will try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite harsh reactions - and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and chaos.
During the march Leaving means Leaving, Mr. Bone stated that he wanted to abandon the Chequers deal.
He suggested that Mr Farage should take the lead and give him responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was at the top, we'd be out now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I will support Brexit but we have to abandon the Chequers deal."
Expressing his position against the EU, he said: "We did not fight in the world wars to be subject.
We want to enact our laws in our country."
Mr Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely false."
Conservative Andrea, who supports Brexit, was also on the march and told reporters: "I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers agreement is not supported by the general public, the opposition will not vote on it, nor will it be supported within our party and by the activists who fill the streets and vote for us.
Please, leave the chequers and start listening.'
In a message addressed to Ms. May, she added: "The prime ministers keep the workplace in cases when they keep promises."
Farage said during the march that politicians should "put pressure" if they plan to abandon the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now, this is a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them that we're not going to let you do something like that."
In a message to the crowd of enthusiasts, he added: "I want you to force our political class, which is about to quit Brexit, to feel pressure.
"We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country who gave us the victory in Brexit and we will not stop until the UK is independent, proud and the government itself."
Meanwhile, the pros of staying marched in Birmingham, before holding a two-hour meeting in the city center.
A small group of activists held a banknote on which the Conservatives wrote against Brexit, after the group showed up this weekend.
Labour supporter Lord Adonis ironized with conservatives about the problems with the certainty they had with a "social application" at the start of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can prepare the IT systems and the technology needed for Canada plus plus, for open borders, for free trade without borders with Ireland," he added.
It's totally a farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he said.
Warren plans to 'study carefully' the possibility of running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will " carefully consider the possibility of running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that Massachusetts' Democratic senator spoke about her future during a joint meeting held on Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a persistent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who co-directed Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been at the center of speculation that she could run for president Trump in 2020.
The meeting held on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters according to the community format, since Trump came to the top.
One of the participants asked him if he planned to run for president.
Warren said it was time for "women to go to Washington and fix the broken government, and that includes putting a woman at the top."
Man Arrested for Murder of LSU Team Player Wayde Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, LA, said on Saturday that they had arrested a suspect for the murder of basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested at around 11 a.m., the Baton Rouge Police Department said at a news conference.
Police posted a video of the shootings on Friday, asking for help to identify the person who appeared there.
Sims, 20, was shot with a gun and killed near the South University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims died as a result of gunshot wounds in the head," police chief Murphy J. Paul told 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde intervened to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was on the scene, holding a gun, and that he had shot the Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and sent to prison at the police department in the eastern area of Baton Rouge.
The 6'6'' Sims played 32 games, 10 of which were titles last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 balls in the table for the match.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after the team's directions give the win to Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the directions of the Mercedes team would play a significant role in the race.
Bottas left the first place and almost "punished" Hamilton after defending his position in the first two gears and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to make a stop and left Hamilton to race in "traffic" at the end of the car pile, something that should have been decisive.
Mercedes made a stop a little later and positioned himself behind Vettel, but Hamilton came to the fore following some maneuvers that forced Ferrari's driver to leave space from within after a double move to defend himself in the third lap.
Max Verstappen started the race from the last row and ended up in the seventh row on his 21st birthday.
He was then at the top in much of the race as he did not change tires to reach a quick finish and passed Kimi Raikkonen ranking fourth.
Eventually, he made a stop in the 44th round but did not come out to improve the pace in the remaining eight rounds by releasing Raikkonen's fourth place.
It's a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and showed me a real gentleman who let me go.
The team has done an extraordinary job with these exchanges of positions," Hamilton said.
Very weak use of the body language.
President Donald Trump ironically angered Senator Dianne Feinstein during a rally on Saturday over her insistence that she wasn't the person who "cast out" Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During a speech at a West Virginia rally, the president did not directly refer to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but said what was happening in the Senate shows that people are "legal, bad and unfavorable."
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that's happening in the Senate over the last few days is when you look at the nativity, when you see people who are intoxicated, the law, the bad and the bad," he said.
"When you look at the covertly released publications and then people say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, were you the one who sold the paper?
Do you remember her answer... did you get the document - "oh, oh, what?"
Oh, yeah.
I didn't get it out."
Wait a minute.
"No, we didn't do it," he said, imitating the senator.
In July, Feinstein sent him a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh from Ford and the document came out earlier in September - but Feinstein denied the information had come out of her office.
"I didn't hide the allegations of Dr. Ford, I didn't put her story on the street," Feinstein told the committee.
"She asked me to keep it a secret, and I kept it as she asked me."
Her denial seems unacceptable to the president, who commented during Saturday night's debate: "In my opinion, gestures really left to be desired.
"Maybe he didn't, but I've never seen any weaker gestures before."
Taking in defense the High Court candidate, who has been accused by three women of sexual misconduct, the president said Democrats are using alleged allegations to achieve their goals.
"They are determined to regain power on any condition.
"They don't care who they hurt, who they have to break to take power and control," Mediaite said in a statement.
League Elite: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored twice for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars offset Friday's loss to the Belfast Giants in the Elite League challenge, winning Saturday's 5-3 return game in Dundee.
The Giants went on to double-benefit thanks to the hits of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized the score for the local team before Dwyer returned the Giants in advantage.
Francois Bouchard scored for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen scored two goals.
This was the third loss of the season, in the Elite League, to Adam Keefe's followers, who on Friday evening, returned from the disadvantage, to defeat Dundee 2-1, in Belfast.
This was the fourth match between these teams, this season, with the first three won by the Giants.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute, at 3:35, from a Kendall McFaul assistant, while David Rutherford gave the assistant to Beauvillier, who doubled the score, four minutes later.
During an intensive first half, Sullivan returned the locals to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt assisted for Cownie's equalization at 15:16.
Dwyer was assured that the Giants would take advantage of the rest by scoring his second goal in the evening, at the end of the first half.
The locals were regrouped and Bouchard returned the match with a strong blow at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined between them by assisting Nielsen, who gave Dundee an advantage for the first time in this challenge, at the end of the second half and secured his team's win with the fifth goal, scored in the last half.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games on Friday, will play the next home game against Milton Keynes.
Air traffic control loses its life by ensuring that hundreds of people on an airplane survive the earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being honored as a hero after he lost his life ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people was safely landed.
More than 800 people lost their lives and many others were declared lost after a major earthquake struck Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong waves continue to haunt the area and many people have been trapped in quarries in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues refusing to rescue him, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the control tower that had ravaged at Palu's Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He stayed to ensure that Batik Air's flight 6321, which was on track at the time, could take off safely.
Then he was thrown out of the traffic control tower when he thought it was crashing.
He later lost his life in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia’s ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, he lost his life this morning, before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"This news has struck our soul," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands on their own, while the local disaster mitigation agency says entry to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that this number will continue to grow, as there were still many bodies under quarries, while others could not be found," agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said in a statement.
Swells reaching up to six meters have devastated Paluna, where a massive mortar ceremony will be held on Friday.
Military aircraft and merchants are bringing supplies and assistance.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the ambulance brings the corps.
There is no clean water.
Mini-markets are plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get even worse."
Indonesia's President, Joko Widodo, arrived on Sunday in Palu and addressed the country's army: "I ask you to work day and night to do any evacuation task.
"Are you ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake earlier this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people lost their lives.
Airplane crash in Micronesia: "Air Niugini" now says a person has been lost after a plane crashed into a lagoon
The airline flying a plane that crashed into the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia has now declared a missing person after it had previously declared that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the plane sinking in the water.
In a press release, Air Newgine said Saturday afternoon that no passenger was found.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in an effort to find the person.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
The local boats helped rescue passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, officials said seven people were escorted to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and that all of them were in stable condition.
The cause of the collision and the consequences of the events themselves remain unclear.
The airline and U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon after it failed to reach the track.
Some witnesses said the plane had crossed the track.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had landed too low.
"That's an incredibly good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that through the water that had reached the bell level, he and other people were able to reach the plane's emergency exits.
He said the drivers were in panic and were screaming, while he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said the sailors who were working on fixing a shell nearby helped rescue them, using an airboat to transport people to shore before the plane sank at about 30 meters (100 feet) underwater.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates that 111 people have lost their lives in collisions with PNG-registered airlines over the past two decades, but Air Newgine was not included in any of them.
Analyst builds the chronology of the night when a woman is burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor presented her arguments in the trial of a person accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert in the field of data analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used the phone data to reconstruct the movements of the 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and the victim, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, the night that the latter changed his life.
According to reports from The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said she received location data from several cell phones indicating that Tellis was with Chambers the afternoon of her death, which dismisses his previous claims.
When the data revealed that his cell phone was in the same place as Chambers during the time he said it was with his friend Michael Sanford, then the police went to talk to the latter.
Sanford was brought to court on Saturday and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When asked by prosecutors if Tellis was telling the truth when he stated that night he was in the Sanford truck, the latter said "he's lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another discrepancy is the statement by Tellis, who said she had known Chambers about two weeks before she died.
The phone numbers showed that they only had one week to get to know each other.
Rowlett said shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis had deleted messages, calls and contact details from his phone.
"He took it out of his life," Hale said.
The defensive house is expected to provide the overlapping signs on Sunday.
The judge said the jury would make the decision that day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hip hop?
A three-member hip hop group seeks to challenge the negative views of this genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claim that hip hop has been removed from its origin of political messages and messages dealing with social issues.
They want to go back to their origins and make the hip hop conscious again.

"Another man of color?"
A New York-based dating couple paused for leaving work after receiving a "racist" message.
A girl from New York has filed a couple for discrimination on her way out of work after she received a wrongly sent message from a mother, who is complaining that she was "another man of color."
The couple denied that they were racists, considering the pawn as "scratch."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her concern when she discovered that Giselle Maurice's young lady was a woman of color, at the time she was introduced on her first day of work, in 2016.
"JOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice, twice.
According to the New York Post, after realizing her gap, Plasco-Flaxman, "feeling ashamed", quit Mrs. Maurice, arguing that their current dad, who was African-American, had done a weak job and that instead, she wanted a Filipina.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for her single day of work and then sent home with a "cash in her pocket".
Now, Maurice is paying the couple for compensation for leaving the job, and is seeking compensation in the amount of <0x24>350 a day for a six-month period, for which she was hired, though without a contract.
"I want to show them that they shouldn't do such things," she told The Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple denied allegations that they were racists, saying Maurice's departure was the right thing to do, as they feared they could not believe them anymore after they had offended him.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasco told The Post.
"But would you leave the children in the hands of a person to whom you have been shown unworthy, even if wrongly?"
Your newlywed child?
Tell me."
Considering the pawn as a "sleep," Plasco said that he and his wife had given birth to a child, two months ago and were in a "very difficult situation."
"Can you take revenge on someone in this situation?"
It's not something positive to do," added Plasco, an investment banker.
While the case has gone to court, public opinion has quickly denounced the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
A new letter shows Paddington's publishers were afraid that readers would not connect with a gold that speaks.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book's acceptance, said: "It's hard to put yourself in the place of a person who reads it for the first time before it's published.
"We're very pleased now that we've seen Paddington's extraordinary success."
She said her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC, before being inspired by a small toy arrow to write the children's book, would be sad if his work were to be rejected, adding that "the story behind the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book had been postponed."
As for Paddington, whom she described as a "very important member of our family," she added that her father was very proud of the success.
"He was a quiet person and not proud," she said.
"Paddington was so true to it that it was like having a successful child: you're proud of him even though it's not exactly your success.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Even though it was his creation and imagination, he always deserved the character of Paddington himself."
My daughter was changing her life and I was forced to say goodbye by phone.
On arrival, her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nizza, where doctors tried to save her life but failed.
"Nad called me regularly to tell me that it was too heavy, that he didn't think he was going to come out," Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I got a call from Nad who told me she was going to die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And that's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much."
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The medications that doctors gave her to keep her heart at work were losing its effect and slowly moving away from her system.
She had died a few years ago, and now everything was “fixed”.
I was forced to sit down and wait, knowing that this was happening.
I couldn't cry or scream because I was surrounded by family and people.
I had to be strong."
As time passed, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, mourning for the loss of her daughter, jumped into a plane with other passengers - who were unaware of what she was experiencing.
"No one knows," she said.
"I sat down, and I cried all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during that flight I felt a great regret for Nad.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved it."
Women who wear black post letters to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones as a result of suicide are working to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted letters with inspiring messages on a bridge in Wales as well as phone numbers of people who can call them for support.
Mrs Davis's son was 13 when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Mrs Davis, 45, based in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with a "smiling" smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
People have always said that his smile illuminates every room.
However, he quit his job before changing his life, as he was "in a really dark moment."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the person who found his brother after committing suicide.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that there will be a domino effect."
Mrs. Davis created the letters, "so that people know that there are people who can help them and with whom they can talk, even with a friend.
Don't sit alone - you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davies for many years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, not long after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he was feeling upset, depressed or anything else," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in behavior.
He was extremely upset on Christmas Day - when the children opened their gifts, he didn't look them in the eye and did nothing."
She said his death was a great trauma for them, but that they had to overcome it: "It's something that destroys the whole family.
We've ruined us.
But we all have to move forward and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future depends on the periphery thread after the FBI's investigation begins.
"I thought that if we could give him something similar to what he was asking for - a limited investigation in time and in the object - maybe we could bring a bit of harmony," Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee was "disintegrating" among many opponents' obstacles.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want to investigate the FBI?
Their hesitation comes as a result of time.
Congressional elections are only 5 weeks away, on November 6th - if Republicans go badly, as expected, they will be greatly weakened in efforts to choose the person they want in the country's highest court.
George W. Bush has called the senators, lobbiing that they support Mr. Kavanaugh, who has worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What's going to happen after the FBI releases its report?
He will be elected to the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh could hold at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to put an end to the situation and confirm it in the High Court.
North Korea's number of deserters under the leadership of Kim
The number of deserters in North Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Unity, said there were about 1127 deserts last year - compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park said the main factors were the strictest controls at the borders between North Korea and China as well as the higher tariffs demanded by human traffickers.
Penn didn't make any public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean deserters take the nationality of South Korea.
Seoul has said more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them go to China, which has the largest length of the border with North Korea and there can be crossed more easily compared to the Armed Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas, which is protected by multiple forces.
China considers immigrant deserters to be illegal and not as refugees, and often rearranges them by force.
Relations between North and South Korea - which are technically still at war - have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Penang and their talks focused on delayed denuclearization negotiations.
The meeting came after a historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed, in general terms, to work for a Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress so far.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and in these circumstances, there is no chance that we, unilaterally, will destroy the first," Mr. Young said in a speech at the UN General Assembly.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical," and says he's not worthy of serving in the High Court.
The minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the High Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and stated that because of his temperament, he was unable to serve in the High Court.
Pelosi made these comments on Saturday, during an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help thinking that if a woman were ever brought up like that, people would say 'hysterical'," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Court Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh categorically denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
During his introductory speech, Kavanaugh was very concerned and at some point almost yelled or "carried his mouth" when talking about his family and high school years.
He accused the Democrats of expressly calling the charges against him "a grotesque and coordinated attack on his figure", organised by liberals instigated by the loss of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi expressed her opinion that Kavanaugh's testimony was proof that he could not serve in the High Court after she showed his prejudice against the Democrats.
"I think he penalized himself with those statements and the way he attacked Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated to answer the question of whether he would try to give Kavanaugh a motion of disbelief in the event of his appointment, and in case Democrats win most of the seats in the House of Representatives.
"Let me tell you -- if he's not telling the truth before Congress or the FBI, then he's unqualified not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Appeal Court in Washington.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's decisions against the Affordable Care Act or about Roe's case against Wade, as he is considered a conservative court.
In the hearings for his appointment, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not the time for a hysterical and unilateral person to become a member of the court and wait for us to say 'how well!'," Pelosi said.
Women have to take advantage of it.
This is a fair verbal attack, months and years of inadvertent exploding, and it can't lead to the end without crying.
"We're crying when we're sick," Mrs. Steinen told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual. What about you?"
She continued, "It helped me a lot a woman who was working in a managerial position, who said she was crying when she was innate, but had developed a style that whenever she was innate and started crying, she said to the interlocutor, "I thought I was crying.
In fact, I'm unharmed."
And then she continued to talk.
And I thought it was a brilliant idea."
Tears are a way of expressing anger, in part because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories from an old job, in an office where men prevailed, and at one point I found myself crying from the inconsolable mother-in-law, was the moment when a larger woman caught me by the cheek - a cold-skinned manager that I knew I had.
"Never let others see you crying," she told me.
"They don't know you're intoxicated.
They think you're bored and it's going to be fun to get bored."
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic member of Congress from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential nominations.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was found in the middle of an extramarital relationship on board a boat called "Monkey Business" and was out of the race, Mrs. Schroeder, who was very unhappy, realized that there was no reason why he didn't even consider running for president himself.
"This was not a well-weighted decision," she told me laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was a more candidate.
Someone called it "The Storm and the Seven Storms."
Since the campaign was in its final stages, it had been left behind with the fundraising, so she promised she wouldn't race if she couldn't raise <0x24>2 million.
But it was an empty war.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave <0x24>1,000 to men, only gave her <0x24>250.
"Don't you think I'm getting any discounts?" she asked herself.
During the speech where she announced that she was not going to develop an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed with emotion – thanks to the people who supported her, angry with the system that made it so difficult to collect money and mark voters instead of the delegates – just sex, in-between.
"It looked like I had a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder recalled about how the press reacted to her.
"It looked like Kleenex was my sponsoring company.
I remember thinking what people would write on the stone of my grave.
"She's crying?"
The advantages of the U.S.-China trade war on Beijing
The first ties of the trade war between the United States and China were overwhelming, and while the war is far from over, a split between the two countries could be an advantage to Beijing in the long term, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year, setting tariffs on China's main export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation was the one that occurred this week, when new tariffs hit goods worth <0x24>200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively taxing half of the goods entering the U.S. from China.
Beijing has been retaliated every time "in nature", finally setting tariffs from five to ten percent over US dollars 60 billion in goods.
China has pledged to return the U.S. with the same currency, and the world's second-largest economic power is unlikely to surrender soon.
The lifting of the measures from Washington would mean surrendering to their demands, but for Chinese President Xi Jinping, it would be too embarrassing to publicly submit to the United States.
However, experts have said that if China plays its letters properly, the pressures coming from the trade war with the United States could positively support China in the long run, to lower the interdependence of these two economies.
"The fact that political decisions, taken faster in both Washington and Beijing, can cause economic downturns in each of these countries, is something far more dangerous than what has been seen from the outside," said Abigail Grace, a research associate at the U.S. news agency.
Syria is 'prepared' for the return of refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is calling for help to rebuild the country devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country's conditions are improving.
"Today, the situation in the country is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists, to restore normality.
Already, there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to their country, from which you had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their well-being.
The UN estimates that some 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
More than 6 million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid to rebuild the devastated state.
But he stressed that the country would not accept assistance or conditional assistance from the countries that sponsored the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup trophy in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup trophy after defeating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 with 10.5, at Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The United States has already lost six consecutive games in Europe and has won the trophy in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown after Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who was the player who scored the most during the tournament, brought his first hit in the water and closed the 16th hole with three more shots than the set level, losing the game to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all his rounds, becoming one of four players who have scored 5-0-0, since the current format began to apply in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5&4 by the lowest-ranked player in the European team, Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
World No. 1 player Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter, who may have played in his final Ryder Cup final.
Spanish veteran Sergio García, who has played in eight Ryder Cups, became the most successful European player of all time in the tournament, with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't cry, but I can't stand it today.
It's been a difficult year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm very, very happy to have the cup.
"Success is for the team, and I'm happy to have the opportunity to help," Garcia said in a statement.
He passed the speech of his compatriot, John Ram, who defeated U.S. 2&1 golf legend Tiger Woods in a live challenge on Sunday.
"It's an extraordinary pride to have defeated Tiger Woods. I've grown up seeing that player," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all his matches in France and now has statistics 13-21-3, during his career in the Ryder Cup.
An odd statistic from one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 important titles, ranking second after Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team has had a tough weekend to get the ball to the right place, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these guys. They fought hard.
There were a few moments during this parade when we put pressure on the European team.
We're breathing.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
The 12 players have been playing well enough.
We will be regrouping, working with the PGA in America as well as with our Ryder Cup committee and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be the captain.
We've got to "get the hat off."
"They played better than us."
