AM in Wales is concerned to "run like a puck"
Some AM, members of the Welsh National Assembly, are confused about a proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal comes after plans to change the name of the National Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
The entire political spectrum is concerned about being ridiculed.
An AM for Labour said his group was concerned because "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For readers who can’t speak Welsh: Twp means stupid in Welsh and pwp means bass.
An AM for Plaid said that the group in general was "dissatisfied" and has proposed other options.
A conservative Welshman said his group was "open" for the name change, but pointed out that it was a short step from MWP to Mupp.
In this context, W is pronounced in Welsh like the letter U in English in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently compiling legislation for the name change, said: "The final decision on what the members of the Assembly will be called is so clear up to the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 granted the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which found strong support for calling the Assembly as the Welsh Parliament.
As regards the title of AM, the Commission proposed Welsh Parliament Members (members of the Welsh Parliament) or WMP, but MWP was most supported in a public consultation.
AM apparently proposes other options, but problems with reaching a consensus can cause problems for President Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on the amendment within a few weeks.
The legislation for the amendments also includes other amendments to how the assembly works, including rules for disqualification of an AM and the design of the committee system.
They are allowed to vote on what to call them when they debate legislation.
Macedonia holds referendum on changing the country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum is an attempt to end a dispute that has been going on for decades with neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its neighbour represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly protested against its attempts to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov opposes the referendum on the name change and has said he will ignore the result.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the name change is the price they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are silent when churches in Harlem are in trouble
“The older people I’m talking to say there was a bar and a church on every corner before,” Adams said.
"Now there is neither or."
He said it was understandable that the bars would disappear.
“People are interacting in other ways nowadays,” he said.
"Bars are no longer like the area's living room, where people go on a regular basis."
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not be as far as the leaders expect and that "before or after that they will end up on the road again".
He also pointed out that churches can be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments filled with people who do not help the remaining churches.
"The absolute majority of people who buy apartments in the buildings will be white," he said. "This will eventually lead to the closure of all churches, as those who move into the apartments will probably not become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original White Methodist Assembly moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had a church nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by Pastor John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of shops on 125th Street, a shopping street in Harlem, which refused to hire or promote black people.
The building was severely damaged in a fire in 1939, but when Pastor Johnson's congregation planned the renovation, they also built the clockwork.
Pastor David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor to St. Martin's, proudly called the music game "the poor's clocks".
The expert who played the clock game in July had another name for it: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the world’s first clock game played by a black musician – Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to the larger clock game at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's didn't replace him.
The events of the last few months at St. Martin’s are a complicated history of architects and entrepreneurs – some employed by the church’s laymen, others by the episcopal foundation.
The church assembly – the assembly’s governing body made up of laymen – wrote to the foundation in July and expressed concern that the foundation would “try to transfer the cost” to the church assembly, despite the fact that the church assembly had not been involved when the foundation hired architects and contractors.
Some members of the congregation complained of a lack of transparency from the foundation.
13-Year-Old Shark Injures Diving After Hummer in California
On Saturday, a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy who was looking for hummingbirds in California on the first day of the hummingbird season, according to officials.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m., near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had dive with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help and paddled there with a group of others to pull him out of the water.
According to Hammel, he first thought that the boy was just happy to find a hummer, but then he realized that the boy shouted, "I've been bite!"
"I've been bite!"
When Hammel came to the boy, he noticed that the whole key leg had been worn up.
"I called out to everyone to get out of the water. 'It's a shark in the water!'," Hammel said.
The boy was flew to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and his condition is said to be critical.
It is unclear what a shark it was.
Bathing captain Larry Giles told mass media that a shark had seen the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had been established that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles also said the victim was traumatized to his upper torso.
Access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas was blocked for 48 hours for investigative and security reasons.
Giles mentioned that there are over 135 shark species in the area, but that most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's is entering the UK's beauty market
Sainsbury's deals with Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with shop-like beauty walks with beauty specialists.
As part of a significant push into the UK’s <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow despite the decline in the fashion and household market, the larger beauty runs will be tested in 11 stores across the country and implemented in more stores next year if they are successful.
The investment in the beauty market is part of the grocery store's attempt to fill the shelves previously taken up by TVs, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury's said it plans to double its beauty range to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space with marked areas, such as in stores like Boots.
The store chain also re-launches its boutique makeup brand so that most of the products are vegan – which is increasingly demanding by young customers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test stand at two Sainsbury’s stores – the first stand opened in Croydon, South London last week and the second opens in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and the tendency to buy smaller amounts of food every day in local stores means that grocery shopping has to do more to attract customers.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that their stores will look more and more like warehouses in an attempt to fight cheap stores like Aldi and Lidl with more services and other products than food.
Sainsbury’s has Argos stores in hundreds of stores and has also acquired a number of Habitat stores since they bought both chains two years ago, which, according to them, has increased food sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
Earlier attempts by the supermarket to give the beauty and pharmacy departments a facelift failed.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership was terminated after a dispute over how the revenues from Boots's retail sales would be distributed.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business with 281 stores to Celesio, which owns the chain Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
They claim that Lloyds would play a role in the plan by adding an expanded range of luxury skin care products, including brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Commercial Manager, said: “We have given our beauty walks a new look and a new feeling to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who can provide advice to customers.
Our range of brands has been designed to meet every need, and with an attractive environment in flexible locations, we are now an attractive beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'shoots' after Holly Willoughby pulls out of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones is "shocked" that TV presenter Holly Willoughby is pulling out of a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby can't afford their brand Truely, with leisure clothes and accessories.
Their activity has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop.
This Morning presenter, 37, announced his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons’ star Peter Jones angry by pulling out of their lucrative last-minute lifestyle brand – to focus on her new appointments with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was “crazy” at a tense meeting at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire on Tuesday when the TV favorite admitted that her new deal – worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million – meant she no longer focused on their brand Truely, with casual clothing.
The business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was expected to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced that she was leaving True on Instagram, Jones flew to one of her vacation homes.
A source said: “Truly was clearly Holly’s top priority.
It would be her long-term future for the coming decades.
Her decision to withdraw shocked everyone involved.
No one could believe it happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods that are ready for sale at the headquarters in Marlow."
Experts believe that the This Morning presenter’s decision to withdraw could cost the company several millions due to significant investments in everything from pillows and lights to clothes as well as the risk of further delays of launch.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truely with Capp 2016 and Jones, 52, took the role as president in March.
The couple spends holidays together and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin’s TV production company.
Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of "I'm a Celebrity" on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We are not commenting on his business."
Hard snack "and then we fell in love"
He joked that the media would criticize him for a comment that some would consider "unworthy of a president" and for being so positive about North Korea's leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in a "news vote":
“I have not given up anything.”
He said Kim wants a second meeting after Trump praised their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have continued.
More than three months after the meeting in Singapore in June, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the leaders of the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a “corresponding response” from the United States after North Korea’s first disarmament move.
He noted that instead the United States continues sanctions intended to maintain pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech to his supporters.
"North Korea is doing great," he said.
“We were on our way to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We now have a sovereign relationship.”
He said his attempts to improve the relationship with Kim had positive results – an end to rocket attacks, freed the hostage and returned the remains of U.S. troops.
And he defended his different way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to behave like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this packed arena, we’d have around 200 people here,” Trump said.
Tsunami and earthquake destroys island in Indonesia, hundreds die
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of Lombok’s population had lost their homes, no state of emergency was announced, which is required for international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have been very clear that they are not asking for international help, which complicates the whole thing," Mrs. Subung said.
Rescue the children gathers a team to go to Palu, but it is still unclear whether foreign personnel can work there.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the Agency, said Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu to determine whether international organisations should be allowed to participate in the assistance work.
Given Indonesia’s constant earthquakes, the country is still sadly unprepared for nature’s anger.
Tsunami protection has been built in Aceh, but they are rare on other coastlines.
The absence of a Tsunami Warning Siren in Palu, despite a warning had been issued, probably contributed to the loss of life.
Even under perfect conditions, it is a challenge to travel between the many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital ship that has been anchored in Lombok to deal with earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it takes at least three days to reach the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on promises to improve Indonesia’s worn infrastructure in his election campaign and has spent large sums on roads and trains.
But the lack of funding has plagued Mr Joko's administration before next year's elections.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from quarantine sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority has adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands lost their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with machetes, arrows and other primitive weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge last minute cleared against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 metres from Chelsea's goal when his team was behind by 1-0.
He transferred the ball to the left and scooped a kick towards the far pole.
The experiment flew high over the target area towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball finally fell over Kepa Arrizabalaga’s hope and ended up in the net.
"I was just trying to get into a position to access the ball and players that Shaq is always playing forward as much as possible, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching and didn't think about it much but just kicked it."
Chelsea led 1-0 after the first half after a goal in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The blue striker threw a pass back to Mateo Kovacic, spinned off close to the midfield and sprinted to the side of Liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick give-and-go at the center.
Then he got a sovereign kick that brought Hazard into the target area.
Hazard ran away from the defense and got the ball in the net at the far pole with a left-footed kick past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play against Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy at 15:00 on Wednesday.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League in London at 15:00 on Thursday.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to the country's disaster agency earlier Sunday.
Many people were reported to have been trapped in the wreckage of buildings that raged in the 7.5 earthquake that hit Friday and triggered waves of up to six meters, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with over 380,000 inhabitants, was full of hurrying from buildings that were ravaged.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of murder after female homicide
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 a.m. with knife wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked people in the area who saw or heard something.
Criminal Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "We are at an early stage of the investigation, but I ask everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious of contacting us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have filmed something with a car camera, to contact us because they may have information that is crucial to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman who was found lives in Birkenhead and that the body was found inside a property.
During the afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman arrived at the site to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is underway and the police are notifying the victim’s closest relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to enter his apartment, but police said no one is allowed to enter or exit the building.
He became pointless when he found out what had happened.
The residents of the building have been informed that it will take several hours for them to get back in.
A police officer told a man that the whole area was being treated as a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared on the spot.
She says "it's so horrible" over and over again.
At 2:00 p.m. there were two police cars inside the detachment and another just outside.
A number of police assistants were inside the detention with an overview of the apartment building.
Persons with information are requested to send a DM to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and enter log 247 from September 30.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell's latest victim of debate over rewriting history
A ban would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's proposal "stupidity" and "try to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would be drawn into the ongoing debate on the removal of statues."
The iconoclasm during the English Civil War was neither commanded nor carried out by Cromwell.
Cromwell's mistake might be sacrificed for what his forefather Thomas did 100 years ago.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell shows the view of the 19th century and is part of the historiography of a man who many still believe should be praised.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than now, think that Cromwell defended Parliament against pressure from outside, in his case from the monarchy.
If this is an accurate representation, it is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
But the conflict of the mid-18th century has undoubtedly affected the development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-known person who represents one side of the matter.
His works as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and celebrated.
Killer Grey Kills Farmers
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his last name Yuan, was found dead with a broken artery and covered in blood in a trail at a market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig breeder is preparing to inject the vaccine in pigs in a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He is reported to have travelled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the cousin found him dead and discovered that the door to a pig shop nearby was open.
He said there was a big pig in the pigtail with blood on his mouth.
A legal investigation confirmed that the 250-pound pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and distorted," the cousin identified with the surname Wu told Guiyang Evening News.
A surveillance camera shot Yuan when he came to the market to feed his pigs at 4:40 p.m. on Thursday.
His body was found an hour later.
The pig that killed the farmer did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked in order to avoid more attacks while police collected evidence on site.
Yuan's family and market officials are reported to be negotiating compensation for his death.
It is rare for pigs to attack people, but it has happened before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and caused serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig pressed a farmer in Wales against a tractor until his wife frightened him away.
When a farmer in Oregon was fed by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "catalyst".
"They're just playful.
They're naughty and they're very curious, they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them respect,” he said.
Remains of Hurricane Rosa for extensive heavy rain to southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa becomes weaker as it travels over cooler waters on Mexico’s northern coast.
But Rosa will bring flooding rain to northern Mexico and southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa had a wind speed of up to 135 km/h, category 1, at five o'clock EST on Sunday and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to travel north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a moat begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and travels east to the US west coast. As Rosa approaches the Peninsula of Baja California as a tropical storm on Monday, it will force deep tropical moisture north into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring up to 25 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture that interacts with the nearby slope will create extensive heavy rainfall in the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Locally, 2.5–10 cm of rain will cause dangerous flooding, clay flows and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will lead to 5–7.5 cm of rain per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5–10 cm of rain is expected in some places in the southwestern United States, especially in large parts of Arizona.
Sudden flooding is possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the widespread tropical rainfall.
It is absolutely not recommended that anyone go out in the desert on foot when tropical rain is expected.
Heavy rain can turn cannons into flowing rivers, and thunderstorms lead to strong local winds blowing around sand.
The nearby tsunami brought with it locally heavy rain to parts of the southern California coastline.
It is possible with total over one cm of rain, which can lead to clay flows and roads.
This would be the first rainfall in the area during the rainy season.
Some skin-deep tropical rainfall will approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before the rain will be more extensive later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to Four Corner on Tuesday and will continue during Wednesday.
October may mean intense temperature changes throughout the United States, when the Arctic cools down but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences in central United States on Sunday.
There is almost a ten-degree difference between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
In the coming days, the remaining summer heat will try to spread again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to have a warm start in October with about 30 degrees from the Great Plains to parts of the northeastern United States.
New York can get 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about five degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast suggests a high chance of warmer temperatures than the average in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's interview
More than 20 million people watched Thursday's arrest testimonies from Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated to the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault allegedly in the 1980s, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political state of death and normal broadcast was interrupted for Friday’s last-minute tweet—Arizona’s Senator Jeff Flakes’s deal with the FBI where they were given a week to investigate the charge.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely sure that Kavanaugh tapped her when he was drunk and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh gave a passionate testimony and said he was absolutely certain that it did not happen.
It is likely that the number of viewers on Friday was higher than the 20.4 million reported by Nielsen.
They counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN; Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers was not immediately available for other TV networks that showed the interview, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has trouble counting people looking from offices.
In comparison, there are as many spectators as for a football match in the final game or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose presenters have shown strong support for Kavanaugh's nomination, had the most viewers with an average of 5.69 million during the day-long interview, according to Nielsen.
ABC had the second largest number with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest was still high after the interrogation.
Flake was in focus during Friday's drama.
After the Republican office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS filmed demonstrators screaming at him as he tried to take an elevator for an interrogation with the Judiciary Committee on Friday morning.
He looked down on the floor for several minutes as the protesters shouted at him, which was shown in a live broadcast by CNN.
"I'm right in front of you," said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?”
They also said, "You have power when so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement and before the elevator doors were closed he said he would have more to say after the hearing with the committee.
The TV network broadcast live several hours later when the Judiciary Committee voted on whether to move Kavanaugh's nomination to a vote with the entire Senate.
But Flake said he only intended to do so if the FBI were to investigate the charges against the nominee next week, which the minority Democrats have called for.
Flake was partially convinced by his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had a big impact, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'political games' around Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union for “political plays” about Britain’s future and to undermine the nation’s interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK on September 29, 2018.
In another interview next to her on the front page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued her attack on her so-called Brexit Chequers plan and said the proposal to collect UK and EU customs duties from each other was "completely unreasonable".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect for the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and imprisoned for murder, police said in Baton Rouge.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpsons, and police said the Sims lost their glasses in the battle.
Police found the glasses at the site and found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS subsidiary WAFB.
After interviewing Simpson, the police said he confessed to shooting Wayde.
His bail was set at <0x24>350,000, according to Advocate.
The forensic doctor in East Baton Rouge Parish released a preliminary report Friday, according to which the cause of death was a shot wound in the head and neck.
The police thank the Louisiana State Police spacefighting force, the police state legal lab, the Southern University police and residents in the area for assistance with the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU's athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their "fight and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98-meter-long forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "crushed" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“You’re worried about this all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano Asks Ash Over Mexico City
Ash from the volcano Popocatépetl has reached the southern part of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity was detected in the crater and they recorded 183 emissions of gas and ash over the course of 24 hours.
The center discovered several females and shellfish.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on windmills in areas of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted increased activity in the volcano located 72 km southeast of the capital since an earthquake of 7.1 hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano called Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police collide with Catalan separatists on the anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters collided with the demanding police while thousands took part in rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarizing vote on secession.
A group of separatists who were held back by the police threw eggs and paint powder on them, leading to dark dust clouds on streets that are usually full of tourists.
Battle targets also broke out later in the day and police used their batons to stop them.
For several hours, the independence groups shouted "never forget, never forgive" while the Unionists shouted "long live Spain".
14 people were treated for minor injuries caused by the protests, according to local press.
The mood is still tense in the region, which yearns for independence one year after the referendum on October 1, which was considered illegal by Madrid but was hailed by Catalan separatists.
An overwhelming majority voted in favour of independence, but participation was low as the majority of those opposed to the secession boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when police tried to stop voting at polling stations in the region.
Independence groups camped overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place anyway, but was forced to take another route.
Electrician Narcis Termes, 68, participated in the separatist protest with his wife and said he no longer believes that Catalonia will become independent.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
“I saw my parents cry with joy about being able to vote, but now we’ve been stuck,” he said.
Despite a decisive but marginal gain in regional elections in December, Catalan independence-oriented parties have struggled to keep the driving force up this year, as many of their most well-known leaders live in self-imposed exile or are trapped in wait for trial on their role in the organization of the referendum.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on her mobile, said the conflict had been fired by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more exciting," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been imprisoned since the end of last year, announced that he intends to run for the European Parliament next year.
"Candidating to the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the return of democratic values and the undermining we have experienced from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Man Arrested After Car Driving Into House
Three men – 33, 34 and 39 – have been arrested after a car was driven into a house in Londonderry repeatedly.
The incident took place in Ballyngard Crescent, around 19:30 BST on Thursday.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the doors and the building were damaged.
An armor can also have been fired at the car.
Many give Livingston 1-0 against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured his win
Livingston shocked the Rangers and condemned Steven Gerrard to his second loss in 18 games as manager for the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's strike proved to be the difference when Gary Holt's side was split second with Hibernian.
Gerrard’s side has not yet won a Premiership loss this season and is facing Hearts, with eight points more, next Sunday.
Prior to that, Rangers Rapid Vienna would welcome to the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston is extending his winning streak to six games – head coach Holt has still not experienced a loss since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses chances against two visitors
Holt's team should have taken the lead long before they made goals; their honesty gave the Rangers all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through but dropped his performance across the goal, and then Alan Lithgow could only shoot wide after sliding in to measure Craig Halkett's nickname across the goal.
The home team was pleased to let the Rangers play in front of them, as they knew they could attack in certain games.
And that was how the decisive goal was made.
The Rangers gave up a free kick and Livingston took advantage of an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaborated to give Menga a chance, who made goals from the middle of the target area.
In that position, the Rangers had dominated the ball, but the home defense was impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely left in peace.
The same pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by Ranger's goalkeeper Allan McGregor's feet and Lithgow shot wide from another of Livingston's determined games.
Crossings entered Livingston’s target area continuously and were handled smoothly. Two penalties were dismissed – after Halkett’s challenge by the exchanger Glenn Middleton and one at hand – after the challenge.
"Fenomenal" from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal display and results for Livingston.
Each one was outstanding and continues to exceed expectations on the way up.
Their playing style and staff have barely changed since they returned to the top level, but Holt deserves the honor of having galvanized the team since their arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding and led a skillfully organized defense, and Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on full-range straight through.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
They've had their moments under Gerrard, but they didn't live up to the standard.
Their last ball did not hold the measure – they only opened the home mass once – and it’s something of a Rangers alarm clock, located in the middle.
Erdogan gets mixed welcome in Cologne
Smile and blue skies were invited on Saturday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany ate breakfast together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany – to repair relations between NATO allies.
They have become unaware of human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the world's largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police said they prevented 25,000 spectators from gathering outside the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters – many of them Kurdish – also heard and condemned both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him to Germany.
The dueling protests show the divided views of a visitor who is considered a hero by some German Turks and condemned as a monopoly ruler by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in car crash
A cyclist has died in a car crash in London.
The crash took place near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast London, around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped the car and the nurses were called there, but the man died on the spot.
The crash takes place a few months after another cyclist died in an infectious accident on Childers Street, about 1.5 km from the crash on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said they were trying to identify the man and notify his closest relatives.
Roads have been blocked and buses have been redirected and drivers are asked to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six guards injured in turmoil
Six prison guards have been injured in riots in a high-security prison for men, according to the Prison Office.
The riots broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 BST on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Specialized "torn guards" have been called there to deal with the unrest, involving eight prisoners on a wing.
The guards were treated on the spot for minor injuries to the face.
A spokesman for the Prison Service said: "Specially trained prison personnel have been sent there to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and are clear that those behind it will be attributed to the police and may receive extended prison sentences.”
HMP Long Lartin is home to more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director was treated in a hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the police were called to the prison to deal with serious unrest where staff were attacked with billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding (drought areas may benefit)
Tropical low pressures are rare to reach Arizona, but that’s exactly what’s likely to happen at the beginning of next week when Hurricane Rosa’s remaining energy pulls out over the desert in the southwest of the United States, with the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of sudden flooding for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to travel directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and bring rain late on Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained status as a tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 65 km of the Arizona border.
National Hurricane Center’s latest models predict 5–10 cm of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other parts of the desert in the southwestern United States, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive 2.5–5 cm of rain with a risk of up to 10 cm.
In areas without the risk of sudden flooding, Rosa’s rain can be a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Floods are very severe, but part of the rain is likely to be useful as the southwestern United States suffers from drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, weather.com reported.
Hurricane Rosa will first travel over the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still with hurricane force on Sunday morning with maximum wind power of 135 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and travels north for 20 km/h.
The storm hits cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean, reassuring it.
It is therefore expected to reach Mexico’s landmass as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Parts of Mexico can get heavy rain, which poses a significant risk of flooding.
“A total of 7.5–15 cm of rain is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with a risk of up to 25 cm,” weather.com reported.
Rosa will then travel north across Mexico as a tropical storm and reach the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will then travel through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
“The biggest danger from Rosa and its remaining energy is very heavy rain in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the desert in the southwestern United States,” said the National Hurricane Center.
Rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden flooding and clay flows in the desert, as well as landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempting to Murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and the condition is reported to be "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, police in Avon and Somerset said.
Police are asking anyone who might have filmed what happened to the phone to show up.
Trump Says Kavanaugh 'Lead, Evil, Anger' From Democratic Party
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the democratic party’s recklessness and scandalous tactics,” Trump told his supporters in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered from the “evil, anger” of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday and strongly and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation that he sexually abused her decades earlier when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified before Congress on his accusations.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw the brilliant quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
“A voice to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to confirm one of the most skilled legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a first-class history of serving the public,” he told his supporters in the West Virginia audience.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he talked about the importance of Republicans voting in the upcoming midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
“I’m not a candidate, but I’m a candidate,” he said.
"That's why I'm walking around and fighting for sovereign candidates."
Trump said the Democrats were trying to “resist and prevent.”
The first decisive vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place by Friday, according to CNN information from an assistant to a senior Republican leader.
Hundreds killed in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, number increases
At least 384 people were killed, many sweeping away as giant waves crashed into the beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia's island of Sulawesi, according to authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when up to six-meter-high waves crashed into the beach in the dark, sweeping out many to a certain death and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami came after an earthquake of 7.5.
“When the tsunami warning came yesterday, people stopped on the beach instead of running immediately from there, and they were victims of the tsunami,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster agency BNPB, said at a meeting in Jakarta.
"The tsunami was not alone, but dragged with it cars, stocks and houses. It affected everything in its path," Nugroho said. He also said that the tsunami had been travelling in the open sea for up to 800 km/h before the affected coastline.
Some climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 facilities in Palu.
Aircraft photos released by the disaster agency show that many buildings and shops are destroyed, bridges are distorted and have collapsed, and a mosque is surrounded by water.
An aftershock still hit the coastal town on Saturday.
The number of earthquakes was felt in an area with a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia’s Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the amount of energy released in Friday’s massive earthquake was 200 times the size of the atomic bomb launched on Hiroshima in World War II.
The city is located at the end of a long, narrow bay, which may have made the tsunami bigger, according to the agency.
Nugroho described the devastation as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The dead were found during the hurricane of collapsed buildings, he said, and 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and injuries could be even worse along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication from Donggala “was completely paralysed without any information,” Nugroho said.
"There are over 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, and its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, but it can get much worse,” they said.
The agency was criticized on Saturday for not informing that the tsunami had struck Palu, but authorities said the waves had emerged within the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building hears frenetic warnings about a tsunami to people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water crashes into the beach and sweeps away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the video.
The earthquake and tsunami resulted in a massive power outage that interrupted all communications around Palu, making the rescue work difficult for the authorities.
The military has begun sending cargo flights from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but evacuated people are still in great need of food and other supplies.
The city’s airport has been opened for auxiliary work and remains closed for other traffic until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit facilities in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths in the tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
Employees from World Vision in Donggala have gone to Palu where they seek shelter during presents on the farm outside the office, but they saw destruction along the way, according to Mr. Doseba.
"They said they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
Aid groups have begun to work diligently on aid, but some complained that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, financing, supplies and staff from abroad may only be used if emergency status is declared after a disaster.
This hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a regional disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the authorities say it’s a national disaster, we can release international aid, but that status has not yet been announced.”
When the second night fell in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, relatives and friends of missing people were still hoping that their loved ones would prove to be the miracles that illuminate dark natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman who had been stuck in a hurry for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, Indonesia’s national screening coach, had trained two of the missing screeners ahead of the Asian Games, which ended in Indonesia earlier this month.
Others who were stuck at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a screen-flying veteran, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr Gendon said hours after the screen flights heard that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages got only one grey book, instead of two blue ones.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he said.
Thieves Take <0x24>26,750 During ATM Filling at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole <0x24>26,750 from a Brink's employee who filled a ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport police.
The driver of the car had emptied a ATM in the entertainment facility and would deliver more money, criminal Dennis McCarthy said in the statement.
While he was busy, "another man jumped up behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money to be delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the press release, but police did not state how many were involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about the identity of the perpetrators should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
He announced the name change on Twitter on Saturday, saying: "The warning formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been called Ye for a long time and used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The name change comes before his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande in the program, who cancelled for "emotional reasons" according to the programme's creator.
Ye is an abbreviation of West's current professional name, but he has also said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'yee' is the word most commonly used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year when he spoke about the title of his album with radio hosts Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, I am us.
It went from Kanye, meaning 'the only one', to only Ye—a reflection of our good, our evil, our confused, everything.
The album is like a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of a number of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has previously been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who previously collaborated with West, has previously written his name with and without bands and versals.
Mexico’s AMLO vows not to use the military against civilians
Mexico’s newly elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use the military against civilians now as the country approaches its 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people".
Troops fired guns at a peaceful demonstration on the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 600 people during an era when left-wing student movements ravaged Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has vowed to support young Mexicans with monthly student grants and by opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of education are attracting young people to criminal gangs.
U.S. should double AI funding
Now that China is becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount they spend on research in the field, according to inventor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment comes after several parts of the U.S. government have made statements about AI, despite the fact that the U.S. does not have a comprehensive formal AI strategy.
China presented its plan last year with the goal of becoming a leader in AI innovation by 2030.
“It would be a good start to double the budget for AI research, given that all other countries are so far behind the United States and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
“A double-sized budget could double the chance that the next major AI transition will be made in the United States,” Lee told CNBC in an interview earlier this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published earlier this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies - Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an AI system that beat the highest-ranked American Othello player, and later chaired Microsoft Research and was CEO of Google's China Department.
Lee mentioned previous technology contests from the U.S. government, such as the Robot Challenge from the Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked what would be next to be able to identify future visionaries.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to get funding from the government, Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes the academic leaders from us, it’s the companies,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed leading figures from universities to work on AI.
Lee said new immigration policies could also help the United States with AI innovation.
“I think green cards should be offered automatically to doctoral students in AI,” he said.
The State Council in China issued its development plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
In China, the National Natural Science Foundation grants to individuals at academic institutions such as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations allocating money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to bring together partners from industry and the academic world, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And earlier this month, DARPA announced an investment of <0x24>2 billion in an initiative they call AI Next.
NSF currently invests over <0x24>100 million a year in AI research.
U.S. legislation that would create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not made any progress in months.
Macedonia's referendum on name change
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has prevented the country from joining the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that the name of its neighbor in the north constitutes a requirement on its territory and has therefore prevented Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the name change would undermine Macedonia's Slavic majority identity.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised doubts as to whether the minimum 50 percent participation required for the referendum to be considered valid will be achieved.
The question on the ballot in the referendum is: "Are you in favour of membership in NATO and the EU with approval of the agreement with Greece?"
But supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is worth changing names if it makes Macedonia, one of the countries formed when Yugoslavia split, able to join the EU and NATO.
"I am here to vote for the future of our country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because that means safer lives for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska, in Skopje.
The referendum is not binding, but enough Members of Parliament have said that they intend to follow the results to make it decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority of Parliament.
According to the State Election Commission, no irregularities had been reported at 13:00.
However, the participation was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the recent 2016 parliamentary election, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I vote for my children, we belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia’s Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko vote in the Macedonian referendum on the country’s name change, which would pave the way for membership of NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia 30 September 2018.
Outside the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, organized a small stage and venue in front of the tents set up by those who boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the European Union, but we want to go with our heads in the air, not to sneak in through the back door," Kavardarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don’t welcome us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of a Euro-Asiatic integration.”
According to Prime Minister Zaev, membership of NATO would lead to well-needed investments in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
“I think the absolute majority will vote yes, because over 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO,” Zaev said.
He said a "yes" result would be a "confirmation of our future."
According to a survey published Monday by the Macedonian Policy Survey Institute, between 30 and 43 percent of voters thought they would vote in the referendum, which falls below the minimum required participation.
According to another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57 percent of participants thought to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them voted yes.
In order for the referendum to be counted, 50 percent of registered voters must vote plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious backlash to the Western-oriented government’s policy since it took over in May last year.
Manchester City's Sergio Aguero takes over all of Brighton's defense to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling beat Brighton's proposal in Manchester City's 2-0 win at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a pass from the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between Brighton's three defenders and went out on the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He turned around a defender and ran away from several others at the edge of Brighton's target area.
Then he pushed a pass to Sterling to the left.
The English forward used his first kick in the target area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the net.
"Aguero has problems with his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing for 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he made a goal at that moment.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial takeover in the Premier League match.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep inside Brighton's revers on that game.
He sent off a nice kick along the left side of Leroy Sane.
Sane took a couple of kicks and led Sterling to the far pole.
Sky Blues forward kicked the ball into the net the moment before it got out of reach.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany at 12:55 on Tuesday.
Scherzer wants to play against the Rockies
The Nationals have been eliminated from the final game, so there was no reason to force one to start.
But race-oriented Scherzer wants to throw on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, which are a game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West, still have a chance for the final game.
The Rockies won a wild card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking for their first division title.
“We’re not playing at all, but we can get a chance to rub rubber in knowledge of the atmosphere here in Denver with the audience and that the other team would play at a higher level than any other team I’d meet this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to be there?”
The Nationals have not yet announced their start for Sunday, but according to reports, they are inclined to let Scherzer cast under the circumstances.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, warmed up in the bullpen on Thursday and would throw on his normal rest day.
Washington’s right-handed pitcher is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 200 2/3 innings this season.
Trump Speaks in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated to the Supreme Court, when he talked about how important it is for Republicans to vote in the upcoming midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
This is one of the big, big ... I’m not a candidate, but I’m a candidate. That’s why I’m going around and fighting for sovereign candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: “You see a terrible, terrible group of radical democrats, you see it happening here and now.
They are determined to take back power whatever it takes, you see their wickedness, their ugliness.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to run over to take over power and control. That's what they want, power and control. We're not going to let them get it."
Democrats, he said, are fighting to “resist and prevent.”
“You’ve seen it in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “arrogant and evil and terrible and fake.”
He mentioned Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who sits in the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was greeted by high-ranking spectators.
"Do you remember what she said?
“Did you leak the document?”
'Eh, eh, eh, eh?
No, no, no, I'm waiting for a ..." It was really bad body language, some of the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a broad church.
They don’t tolerate people who say what they think.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the latest in a series of Labour MPs who hear that we are not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way when she stood against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on the security of the nation, on Europe – ironically, similar topics for which Jeremy criticized former leaders.
In a statement on Friday’s meeting with Nottingham East Labour, it was stated that “we want the meetings to be welcoming and productive.”
For most of my eight years as Labour’s local MP, the GC meetings on Fridays have been exactly that.
But now, unfortunately, many meetings are not, and the promise of "more friendly, more cautious" policy has been forgotten a long time ago, if ever it even started.
It has become increasingly obvious that divergent views are not tolerated within Labour, and every opinion is judged on the basis of whether the party leader accepts it.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues I previously thought had a similar political view that I expected to make a reversal and take positions that I would otherwise never have agreed with – whether it was the security of the nation or the EU's internal market.
Every time I speak in public – and it really doesn’t matter what I say – I follow a sketch of social media outlets demanding that I be deposed, criticizing middle-aged politics and saying that I shouldn’t even be in Labour.
And this doesn't just affect me.
In fact, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of these colleagues when they face a stream of sexist and racist insults every day but never give up.
One of the biggest disappointments of this era's policy is the level of insults now considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour should promote a culture of tolerance.
But in reality, we are no longer this broad church, and with every mistrust and change of the selection rules, the party becomes more and more narrow.
I've been given a lot of advice over the past two years about flying under the radar and not being too straightforward, so "it's okay."
But that’s not why I became a politician.
Ever since I joined Labour as a school student 32 years ago, provoked by Thatcher’s government’s neglect that literally caused my primary school classroom to collapse, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need it most – both at the local level and as government minister.
I have never concealed my political views, and that includes the latest election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way confused about my views on policies and topics where I do not agree with the current leadership.
To you who promoted Friday’s call, I just want to say that when the country goes towards a Brexit that will harm households, businesses and public services, I don’t understand why anyone would want to waste time and energy on my loyalty to Labour’s party leaders.
But my main message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituency – both Labour and others: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats of deposing or political convenience will prevent me from doing what I think is best for you all.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Unsuccessful Ayr on top
Two last-minute attempts may have distorted the result a bit, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this wonderfully entertaining Tennent's Premiership match.
They are now at the top, the only unsuccessful side of the ten.
In the end, it was their superior defense, as well as their ability to take chances, that gave the home team the win, and coach Peter Murchie has all the right to be satisfied.
"We have been tested during our matches so far and are still unbeaten, so we are so obviously happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Ayr deserves it, they took better chances than we did."
Grant Anderson's 14th minute attempt, which was converted by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the lead but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, released by the Warriors for the match, allowed Melrose to let the numbers speak and Jason Baggot made an unconverted attempt.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a penalty, and at the end of the first half he scored and converted a solo attempt to give Ayr a lead of 17-5 in the break.
But Melrose got a good start in the second half and Patrick Anderson's attempt, converted by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
There was then a long wait after a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried by the plan, and after the restart Ayr increased the leadership again with an attempt from Stafford McDowall, who was converted by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain Blair MacPherson then got a yellow card, and Melrose again forced the extra man to pay with an unconverted attempt from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of tremendous pressure.
But the home team recovered and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for tackling Climo without the ball, McPherson made a touch down from the penalty line-out behind Ayr's mouth.
Climo converted, which he did again almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's box kick and sent off flanker Gregor Henry for the home team's fifth attempt.
Still Game star appears ready for new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kiernan seems ready to enter the restaurant industry after it was discovered that he has been appointed CEO of a licensed restaurant business.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular series, which he writes and plays alongside his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
Duon has announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the finale of the series, and Kiernan seems to be planning for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment, but a source on Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to enter Glasgow's "flowering restaurant industry".
"The sea belongs to us": coastless Bolivia hopes the court will open the way to the Pacific again
Marines patroll a rig-covered headquarters for the fleet in La Paz.
Public buildings have a sea blue flag.
The fleet’s bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon have the motto: “The sea belongs to us.
It is our duty to recover it.”
In coastless Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict is still strong – and it is also the longing to sail the Pacific again.
This hope is higher than in decades now when Bolivia awaits a decision from the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of deliberation.
“Bolivia has the operation, an atmosphere of unity and peace, and so clearly awaits the outcome with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country, hoping that the Court in The Hague will judge in favour of Bolivia’s demand that Chile, after years of irregular discussions, should negotiate with Bolivia to allow them their own outlet to the sea.
Monday’s decision is also of great importance to Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president facing a controversial re-election fight next year.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe it is incredible that the court is judging to the benefit of Bolivia, and that not much would change even if it did.
The United Nations Court of Justice, based in the Netherlands, has no right to allocate Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the decision was announced only six months after the final arguments suggest that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And the last four years may have hurt rather than promoted Bolivia's chances.
"The question of access to the sea has been seized by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
She argues that Morale’s aggressive rhetoric has haunted Chile’s remaining well-being.
Bolivia and Chile will eventually continue the discussion, but it will be extremely difficult to do so after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltsé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, did not consider that the court’s decision had been taken unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will be given "a unique opportunity to start a new era for its relationship with Chile" and a chance to "stop 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the question of the sea as a political crack.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific," he said.
“The decision is a chance to realize that we have to move on from the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament requires trust in U.S.
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, said the nation will not disarm its nuclear weapons until they can’t trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit in Singapore between the two rival leaders.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of resolving the death toll of nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un.
Mr Ri said it was a "wishful dream" to continue sanctions and the U.S. protests against a statement that the end of the Korean War would ever condemn North Korea.
Washington is hesitant to agree to the statement without Pyongyang launching significant nuclear disarmament first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want another summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang really intends to get rid of a weapon arsenal that the country probably sees as its only chance to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris Fashion Shows Reveal Latest Line Huge Headbands On The Way To Shops Near You
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely block the sun, we have the right thing for you.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed a range of crisp, oversized headbands for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which blended the style icons of Paris fashion week.
Incredibly impractical hats have taken over Instagram this summer, and the designers have sent off their eye-catching creations on the catwalk.
Valentino’s main creation was an exaggerated beige hat with a feather-like wide hat bristle that completely took over the models’ heads.
Other oversized accessories included jeweled watermelons, a wizard hat, and even an ananas – but they are not meant to keep their heads warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks, in the right time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had pleated lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than high couture.
One creature resembled a wet suit with snorkeling and diving mask, and another looked like a melted glass streak.
And if you continue with that tremendous courage, you are lucky.
Fashion experts predict that the huge traps may be on their way to shops near you.
The oversized hats come immediately after La Bomba – the straw hat with a 60 cm rim that has been seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the incredibly impractical hat that has taken over social media sent out another great creation on the catwalk – a straw beach bag that was almost as large as the model in the swimsuit that held it.
The Raffia bag in terracotta, with raffia frescos and a white leather handle, excelled in the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags in stores next summer – the designer has had such an impact that it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language Skills Decisive for Global Citizens
Scottish independent schools retain outstanding academic achievements and this continued in 2018 with yet another set of outstanding trial results, which is only reinforced by individual and collective progress in sports, arts, music and other societal endeavors.
With up to 30,000 students in Scotland, the schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further education, their chosen careers and their role as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement tailored curricula, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and in demand topics in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart.”
It’s a powerful reminder that we can’t just rely on English when creating relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year’s trial results show that languages are at the top of the list, with the highest number of approved results in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students studying foreign languages received an A in the Higher Grade final exam.
Data, collected from SCIS 74 member schools, showed that 72 percent of students who studied Mandarin received an A in Higher Grade, and 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as crucial skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as subject choices are now considered as important as natural sciences, engineering, engineering and mathematics on curricula in independent schools and beyond.
A 2014 survey by the UK’s Commission for Employment and Skills found that employers had difficulty filling their vacancies for various reasons, with 17 percent being attributed to a lack of language skills.
With that said, language skills become increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more future jobs requiring language skills, these skills become necessary in a globalized world.
Regardless of your career choice, they will have a real advantage in the future if they have adopted a second language.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a survey of more than 4,000 British adults published by YouGov 2013, 75% said they could not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation in it, and where French was the only language that totaled up in a two-digit percentage (15%).
That is why it is so important to invest in language education for our children.
Being able to speak multiple languages, especially those used in developing countries, gives your child a better chance of finding a meaningful job in the future.
In Scotland, each school will learn different combinations of languages.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach in languages considered most important to the UK by 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from within independent schools, with teachers specializing in this field.
Scottish independent schools strive to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and provide them with the skills needed to succeed, regardless of what the future holds for them.
In a global economic environment it is undoubtedly language that continues to be decisive for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for Scottish youth.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron makes Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans looking forward to seeing LeBron James make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's first season game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he plays has not yet been determined.
“There will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' season schedule.
"I don't need seasonal games at this stage of my career to be ready," he said.
Trumps West Virginia campaign event, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is making his first campaign event tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It’s Trump’s first of five planned performances next week, including events in places he has great support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Waiting for a valid vote of his nominee for the vacant post of the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build support for upcoming mid-term elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress ahead of the November election.
What time is Trump’s West Virginia rally tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trumps Wheeling, West Virginia promotional events are scheduled for 19:00, tonight Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia-rally online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to deal with this week’s interrogation of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who was suspended after charges of his sexual abuse, with an expected delay of the vote from the Senate of up to a week while the FBI’s investigation of the case is ongoing.
But the primary purpose of these events is to help Republicans get some meat on their legs before the November election.
Thus, President Trump said that these five meetings next week are aimed at "engageing volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter the hectic campaign period,” a Trump campaign spokesman said.
The night's event, scheduled at the Wesbanko Arena in Wheeling, can attract fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract attention from Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican West Virginia senator Patrick Morrisey, who has cracked down on the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come there to try to give him an increase in opinion polls,” said Simon Haeder, a state scholar at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA fights to keep hope alive for Sunday's singles
After three unilateral sessions, Saturday afternoon’s match matches could have been what was required for this Ryder Cup.
The moment’s swinging pendulum is a completely invented sport concept, but something that players really believe in, and more than ever before in competitions like these.
So what momentum is it about now?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so we're wearing it as a little momentum I guess," said Jordan Spieth when he finished the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, of four points in advance with twelve more to win.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel they have a little wind in the seal, but they have a lot to be encouraged by, not least in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and came home three points out of four.
Spieth has been watery from tea to green and precedes with good example.
The winning streak was even higher as his round continued and he lowered a decisive putt to take the match four all-square when he and Thomas had left with two after two games.
His putt who won them the match at 15 met with a similar scream, with the conviction that the American team is not yet out of the game.
"You really have to dig deep and worry about your own match," Spieth said.
That’s all these players have left now.
18 holes to win.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the Ryder Cup’s indisputable story.
Europe’s odd but charming couple is four out of four and now nothing can go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple that did not make a bogey on Saturday afternoon and they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
These performances and audience reactions establish that they are the players to turn on on Sunday and there are no more popular players who could take home a potential European victory as the sun sets over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both, at the same time in different holes.
However, it is too early to talk about a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson shortened the process with Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of the morning, along with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine lowered the Spaniards and the Swedes into a hole they never even came near to crawl out.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you out of the hole.
Fourball and foursome are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and how a strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant lead before the last day, but this four-session also showed that Team USA has a fighter leap that some, especially on the US side, had doubted.
Europe takes the lead by 10-6 in the Ryder Cup last day
Europe will have a strong advantage on the Ryder Cups last day after coming out of Saturday’s four-ball and four-somes match with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two victories over a besieged Tiger Woods and came home four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, who fought to keep the cup they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that never really started during the morning's four-ball by 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in the fourth quarter and won two games, but that was not enough for victory.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to keep the cup.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, named "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend, only the second pair is to win four points from their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in four balls, they beat a exhausted Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressing 5 & 4.
Woods, who scored two matches on Saturday, showed evidence at individual moments of brilliantness, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in four-ball and foursome, and seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose, rested during the morning fourball and returned to partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes to a 2 & 1 win over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked 1st and 3rd in the world.
Europe had no wind all the way, but it was a nice, windy day just southwest of Paris.
The three-time winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They took home the 2 & 1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in four-ball and returned later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in foursome after losing the two opening holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cups has a team come back from a four-point base in the singles matches, however Furyks side only needs an unbeaten result to keep the cup.
Having been the second best in two days, it looks like a Sunday counterattack can be hard to get through.
North Korea says it will “never” disarm unilaterally without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions deepened its distrust of the United States and it was not possible for the country to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization's annual general assembly that North Korea had taken "significant measures to show its goodwill" over the past year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear testing facilities and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons.
“But we don’t see any similar response from the United States,” he said.
"Without any trust for the United States, there will be no trust for our national security, and under such circumstances, there is no chance that we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
While Ri reiterated his well-known North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to a nuclear-power-shaped approach that would lead to the reward of North Korea when it took gradual steps, his statement appeared significant, as it did not reject a unilateral nuclear solution so far.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim promised to work against "the development of nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first dismantle its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also refused negotiations to ease harsh international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘deletion first’ and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its purpose through coercion and even opposes the ‘declaration of ending the war’,” Ri said.
"The notion that sanctions can get us on our knees is a dream for people who lack knowledge of us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions deepen our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans at a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader highlighted at the UN earlier this week.
The minister instead pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korea’s leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the party on this issue of nuclear disarmament were South Korea and not the United States, the Korean Peninsula’s nuclear disarmament would not have come to such an end.”
Yet the tone in Ri’s speech was dramatically different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea’s future ability to reach U.S. mainland with missiles was inevitable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but it said that much work remains and that sanctions must remain until North Korea disarms.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for this, saying that “if it takes two years, three years or five months,” it doesn’t matter.
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The maintenance of the Security Council’s sanctions must continue with force and without fail until we implement a complete, definitive, verified disarmament.”
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to stifle the funding of Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri in connection with the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, but North Korea accused him a few hours later of making “gangster-like demands”.
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile plant and also a nuclear power plant if the United States took "corresponding measures".
He said Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he sought were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and is moving towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvest students take courses to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has prompted all PhD students to improve their sleep habits in an attempt to combat the growing mahogany culture to study through caffeine-filled "drippings".
An academic study found that students at the world’s leading universities are often reckless when it comes to the very foundations of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he considers to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact sleep deprivation had on learning.
“At the end of the day, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why can’t I know this until now, during my last year?’
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep – which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, organized for the first time this year, explains to students the importance of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improving their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health care services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The hour-long course covers a range of interactive tasks.
In part of the course there is a picture of a student room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation and the importance of good sleep habits.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of campuses, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that it will not change the behavior of students directly.
But we believe they have the right to know – just as one has the right to know about the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes,” Professor Czeisler added.
The culture of pride in "sleeping" still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Ensuring that you have enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student’s “secret weapon” to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said – even to avoid weight gain because insomnia puts the brain in a state of hunger and makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course and has read one of his courses last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course was an eye-opener and inspired him to campaign for a campus-wide course.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all PhD students to complete a similar study program before they begin their studies at the high-performance institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm for when to lie down and when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can make you turn around the clock, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mengas goals lower Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another loss today when Dolly Menga's strike sent Steven Gerrard's uneven side to a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The Ibrox side was looking to take home their first win on the road since February 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team delivered Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his team eight points after Ladbrokes Premiership leader Harts.
Many beat up to seven minutes before halftime and the Rangers never managed to even out the result.
While the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and is just behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there may be more trouble on the lute for the Rangers after lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an object was thrown from the far end.
Gerrard made eight changes in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt on the other hand went with the same Livi 11 who took a point of Hearts last week and he would have been happy about the way his homicide game overwhelming opponents each time.
The Rangers must have dominated, but Livingston did more with the ball control they had.
It should have been a goal already two minutes into the game when Menga's first pass passed Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his big chance and shot outside.
A free kick deep from Keaghan Jacobs then reached team captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only reached the rear pole.
The Rangers took control of the match, but it seemed to be more hope than belief in their game during the last third of the match.
Alfredo Morelo felt certain that he should have had a penalty when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian appeal.
The Rangers managed to score only two goals in the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily received Lassana Coulibaly's nick and a tam kick from Ovie Ejaria.
Livi’s opening shot in the 34th minute may have gone against the spirit of the game, but no one can deny that their knitting deserved it.
Again, the Rangers failed to deal with Jacob's fixed situation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher fit Scott Robinson, who remained calm and chose Menga for a simple ending.
Gerrard acted at the break when he switched Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and the shift gave almost immediate effect when the outside hit the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block the attempt.
But Livingston continued to get opponents to play exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett swapping up long pass after long pass.
Holt's side could have strengthened his leadership in the final stage, but McGregor managed to prevent Jacobs before Lithgow knocked out after the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had yet another late demand for punishment when he was tampered with Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
Almanac: The Inventor of Geiger Counter
And now a page from Sunday's almanac: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the manicure called Geiger Meter.
Geiger meters have become a cornerstone of science since then and also figures big in pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", with the lead roles in the seemingly unlikely cowpoke scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
“What in the world is that?”
Rogers: “It’s a geiger meter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals.
Evans: "Yes, it's poping now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Immune System to “See” Cancer Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Immune System to “See” Cancer Cells and Kill them
Vaccination teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory.
They can then "see" a protein that is common to many cancers and then re-injected
An experimental vaccine shows promising results in patients with different forms of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize cancer, saw her ovarian cancer cells disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein that is common to many cancers called HER2, and then reinitiate the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "promotes the growth of several types of cancers, including breast, ovarian, pulmonary and colon cancers," explained Prof Berzofsky.
A similar method of taking immune cells from patients and “learning” them how to target cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West supported Trump by wearing a MAGA cap, after his SNL performance.
It didn't go so well.
Kanye West was kicked out of the studio during Saturday Night Live after a whimsical performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he himself would run for the 2020 post.
After performing his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town where he wore a Make America Great hat, he rallyed against the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
“So many times when I talk to a white person they say, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s racist?’
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago, he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee on the allegations of sexual abuse made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it wasn't broadcast, West's play was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock tried to drive with West with the speech.
West had also complained to the public that he had been harassed backstage for his headdress.
"They mobbed me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat."
They bullied me!
And then they say I fell low,” he said, according to the Washington Examinator.
West continued, "Do you want to sink low too?" and said that he would "put my supermancape on, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Test it with love.”
His comments attracted more bureaucrats at least twice from the audience and employees from SNL seemed to be generating, Variety reported. One person said, "It became the deadliest in the studio."
West had come in as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West confused many with his appearance of the song I Love It, dressed up in a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the Conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted, "To one of the bravest souls: THANK YOU FOR STANDING ON YOUR MOBB."
But talk show host, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West simply "was himself and it's absolutely wonderful."
“But I chose not to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his ‘art’) that I think embraces and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
We are, she admits.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said he was now "the creature formerly known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Colleague Snoop Dogg has called himself Snoop Lion and of course the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist who was formerly known as Prince.
Trial for attempted murder after stab wounds at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The respondent is expected to appear at the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The allegations will be reviewed by the prosecutor's office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington strikes toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-swinging role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, has spoken negatively about the stereotype of the male hero and says that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they have to be tough to be respected.
In a statement to Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes "something has gone wrong" and questioned how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity during the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his co-star in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he feels "thinking strongly" to deal with the problem.
"I personally feel quite strong, right now - where have we gone wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"How have we raised men in view of the problems we see now?"
Kit believes that TV may partially be responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its highly masculine characters.
He continued, "What is innate and what is learned?
What is learned on TV and on the streets, which makes young boys feel that they have to be in a certain way to be men?
I think that’s really one of the big questions of our time – how do we change it?
It’s clear that something went wrong for young men.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not do any Game of Thrones sequels when the series comes to an end next summer and says he is "ready with battlefields and horses".
Starting in November, Kit will play a new film by Sam Shepard’s True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks the meeting with his wife Rose was the best experience from Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife thanks to the series, so it gave me my future family and my future life,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, whom Kit's character Jon Snow falls in love with, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie's family estates in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has reported an increase of 14% in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been affected in the country, health authorities say.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were transferred via sex and marked a change from previous years.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly through parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 from year to year.
HIV infection through intercourse is an acute issue in China’s HBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against HBT persons is said to be widespread.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will sooner or later marry women.
Many of the infection cases are due to insufficient protection during intercourse in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medicine as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies staff leaked GOP senator's information, blames "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday condemned allegations that one of her employees posted personal data on three Republican U.S. senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that these allegations were spread by right-wing extremist websites.
“Lies, lies, and more repugnant lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The released information reportedly contained home addresses and phone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information came online Thursday, compiled by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on charges of sexual abuse against nominated Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came sometime after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Water’s office and released information about a member of Water’s staff, Hill reported.
“This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
"My staff - whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false claims - was in no way responsible for the leakage of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie.”
Water’s statement was quickly criticized online, among other things by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is annoying," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that she does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t be angry.
They must not be contentious.
They must not question the motives of the questionnaire.
They must be calm and senseless.”
Fleischer appeared to try to compare Water's reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of appearing angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who nominated Waters in the middle of the term, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great for the truth," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had warned "appropriate authorities and the criminal prosecutor's essence of these fraudulent demands.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be disclosed," she continued, "and that they will be held legally liable for all their acts that are destructive and dangerous to all my employees."
Review of Johnny English Strikes Again - Powerless Spy Parody by Rowan Atkinson
It is now tradition to look for Brexit meanings in every new film with British slope, and the same seems to apply to this re-release of the latest Johnny English action comedy - a series of spy parodies that was kicked off in 2003 with Johnny English and got a new life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is water satirical about how obviously bad we are to become the nation’s new export commodity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face has received his license to renew the client for the second time - his name signals more than anything else that he is a wide comic creation intended for the cinema audience even in non-English speaking countries.
He is, of course, the clumsy secret agent, who despite his bizarre claims about smoothie glamor has gotten a little bit of Clouseau, a slutty Mr Bean and a measure of the guy from the opening ceremony to the 2012 Olympics in London.
He is also originally based on the traveler and international mysterious man that Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads that create chaos wherever he goes.
There are one or two great moments in the last JE movie
I loved when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and when the rotor blade for a short time hit his helmet.
Atkinson’s talent for physical comedy is shown, but humor feels rather low and strangely superfluous, especially as the “serious” film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humor feels like it’s adapted for children rather than adults and for me, Johnny English’s weird behavior isn’t as inventive and focused as Atkinson’s silent movie bravades in the role of Bean.
The current issue is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain’s supersecret web of spies, revealing the identities of all UK agents on the field, to the agent in the service’s great dissatisfaction – an incredibly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It will be the last straw for a prime minister who is a pompous and hardworking figure, who already suffers from a complete collapse of her political popularity: Emma Thompson does her best with this quasi-Teresa-May character but the script does not offer much to work with.
Her intelligence adviser informs her that when each active spy is busy, she must use someone who has retired.
And that means the native Johnny English in his own high person, now employed as a teacher in any well-behaved institution, but offering informal lessons in the art of working undercover alongside.
English was sent back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his former long-lived sidekick Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine captain, a jolly hockey sticks role where Vicki Pepperdine is about to be wasted.
So Batman and Robin are back after everything went so terribly wrong on Her Majesty's Secret Service and meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful woman fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister will fall hard for the charismatic tech billionaire, who claims he can solve Britain’s computer crash: the unfortunate Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of farce-like attitudes: dressed up as waitresses, they set fire to a flashy French restaurant; they create chaos when they smuggle on Volta's luxury boat; and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to use a VR headset to get acquainted with the inside of Voltas.
There is certainly a lot of work behind the latter sequence, but despite the fact that the film is both charming and fast-paced, it has an air of children’s TV around it.
Pretty moderate as everything.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I can’t stop thinking: Can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that matches his talents?
Labour denies a plan for Britons to work a four-year-old’s week but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan that is that the British work a four-day week - but get paid for five.
The party wants business leaders to pass on savings made through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving them an extra free day.
It would see employees enjoy a three-day weekend - but keep the same salary.
According to sources, the idea would "fit" with the party's economic agenda for the benefit of the workers.
Changing to a four-day week has been approved by Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from economic change.
A senior representative at Labor told The Sunday Times: A review of the policy is expected to be published by the end of the year.
“It won’t happen in one day, but a four-day working week is an effort that fits the party’s stance to balance the economy for the benefit of the worker and the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, even the Greens party that promised a four-day working week during their 2017 election campaign.
However, this objective is not listed by Labour as a whole.
A Labour spokesman said: "A four-day work week is not the party's policy and it's not something the party agrees on."
Chancellor John McDonnell used last week’s Labour Conference to communicate his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from “faceless leaders” and “snatchers” on state-owned companies.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies cannot get back their full stakes, as a Labour government can make "deductions" because of what they perceive to have been wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to place employees in corporate boards and create so-called Inclusive Ownership Funds, where 10% of the private company’s equity is transferred to its employees, who are then expected to receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy on the TV show “60 Minutes” about whether the FBI’s investigation into Kavanaugh could change their views
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question of whether the agency's investigations could cause some Republican senators to change their position on the matter.
In an interview broadcast Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
“I said when I went into the hearing, I’ve spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, when the claim came out, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, convinced, unambiguous.”
Graham's voice, however, seems impatient.
"I've already decided on Brett Kavanaugh and it would take a dynamite charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all the names she names couldn't verify it.
That was 36 years ago.
I don’t see anything new changing.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an enormously impressive collection of emerging stars and an equally impressive mission; to fight world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people marching to Central Parks Great Lawn, not only to enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event’s real goal: to fight extreme poverty by 2030.
According to a 2012 statement, the Global Citizen Festival is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to fight poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you weren’t ready to pay for a VIP ticket), concert guests would perform a series of tasks, or “actions” such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, calling or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to convince people to act, or is it just about so-called "clickivism" - people who feel they make a real difference by signing an online application or writing a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen reports that more than 19 million “acts” have been recorded from its supporters who fought for a variety of targets.
These measures have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than <0x24>37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements derived from its actions, of which at least <0x24>10 billion has already been paid out or financed.
The group estimates that the accumulated assets so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership between investors and stakeholders who are committed to “helping children develop to their full potential”, promising to provide Rwanda with <0x24>35 million to help combat malnutrition in the region after getting more than 4,700 global bailouts from tweepers.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just like you, we can make social injustice as undernutrition a footnote in history,” Tracey Ullman, ambassador for the partnership, told the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 measures were taken to require the UK to improve the diet for mothers and children, the government announced funding of the project, Power of Nutrition, which includes diet programs aimed at 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the common questions on his website: “What makes you think that we can fight extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements ahead of us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists performing at this year’s New York event, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use its fleet in a "blocked" to prevent Russian energy exports
The government can use its fleet "if necessary" to prevent Russian energy operators from entering markets, including in the Middle East, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said, citing the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where it appears at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, just like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern parts of Europe," he said.
According to him, there are ways and means to deal with it.
“The United States has the ability to, with our fleet, ensure that the sea routes are kept open and, if necessary, apply blockades, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants of the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself "the energy consumer's voice" in the United States.
He compared Washington’s approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are really the same.
“The economic option against Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuels,” he said, referring to Russia as a “day country” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements will come after the Trump administration has aimed to increase exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, to replace Russia, the far cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to Trump made Berlin a "capture" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the <0x24>11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double its existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
They argue that Washington’s resistance to the project is driven only for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exercising pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russia’s energy minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US energy secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position was reversed by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I strongly dislike a third party disrupting our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
“Elizabeth Warren will take a ‘ordinary thinker’ if she is to stand up in the 2020 presidential election,” Massachusetts Senator said.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would take a "ordinary thinker" about her participation in the presidential election after the U.S. mid-term election.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider appointing as a candidate.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman at the top,” she said.
“After November 6th, I will take a lot of thought into running for president.”
Warren weighed on President Donald Trump during the council meeting and said that he "taken this country in the wrong direction.
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing for our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been free-speaking in his criticism of Trump and his nominee for the Supreme Court, Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a vote released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren’s own supporters did not believe she would run for 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' "credible" voters said the Senator should not run, according to a survey conducted by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidate.
The survey showed more support for a candidacy by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent for a potential candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed in terms of a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin Quotes Track Palins PTSD at Donald Trump Rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after taking up the recruitment in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my own son is going through, what he's going through now that he's back, I can relate to other families who have experience of PTSD and part of the trauma our soldiers are returning with," she told the audience at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they will come back like other people, they will come back hardened, they will come back and wonder if there is respect for what their colleagues, soldiers and pilots and all other members of the military have given the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic violence against a woman, attempting to prevent a report of domestic violence and possession of weapons in a drunken state, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, as well as the District of Columbia support the questioning of a new asylum policy
Arton states and the District of Columbia support a legal trial aimed at a new U.S. policy denying asylum to victims fleeing gang-related violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and districts filed a friend-of-the-court application on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and his violent gang members" mistreated her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was imprisoned in Texas.
Attorneys supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, countries producing a large number of asylum seekers, as nations facing major problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy amended a 2014 decision by the immigration authorities that allowed illegal immigrants to seek asylum to escape domestic violence.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of specific facts and circumstances to which the claim applies, and such provision is contrary to that principle," according to the friend-of-the-court report.
Lawyers further argued in the report that policies denying immigrants’ entry are damaging the U.S. economy, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide necessary labour.”
In June, Justice Minister Jeff Sessions ordered judges in asylum cases to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their homeland due to persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said when the policy was announced on June 11.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems – even all the serious problems – that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in search of survivors
For the survivors, the situation looked more and more dreadful.
"It feels very exciting," said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, who comforted her feverish boy in an evacuation center in the city of Palu.
"The ambulance picks up dead bodies all the time.
“Clean water is a waste.”
The inhabitants were seen returning to their destroyed homes, rooting through water damaged property and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, who were injured in the 7.5 earthquake were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who was affected by a broken back and shoulder, rested outside Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to continued strong rear scalp.
With tears in his eyes, he told me that the violent earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t run away.
I was pushed into the ruins of the wall, I think,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of “Mobbing” with “Propaganda Ads”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page announcement in a U.S. daily about the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China Daily paying a supplement to the Des Moines Register - the state of Iowa's best-selling newspaper - after accusing China of trying to participate in the U.S. 6th Congressional election, something China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in a escalating campaign by Washington intended to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to use advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a escalating trade war with high tariffs on each other’s imports.
China’s early trade war retribution rates were designed to affect exporters in states such as Iowa supporting Trump’s Republican party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former Iowa governor, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a debate article in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, “is now doubling the bullying by posting propaganda advertisements in our own free press.”
“The Chinese government uses America’s dear tradition of freedom of expression and a free press to spread propaganda by publishing paid advertisements in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, in the newspaper quiz on the street here in Beijing you will find a limited number of divergent votes and will not see any true reflection of the different views the Chinese people can have about China’s worrying economy, as the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party with iron hand,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers denied the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans frighten women voters in mid-term elections through Kavanaugh fiasco, analysts warn
As many top Republicans defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh facing multiple charges of sexual abuse, analysts have warned that there will be a backlash, especially from women, during the upcoming election.
The feelings about this have been extremely high, and most Republicans have already shown where they stand in the election.
Grant Reeher, professor of science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona)'s last attempt at an FBI investigation will be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to the Washington, DC newspaper.
On Friday morning, demonstrators chanted "November is coming!" as they protested in the hall of the Senate building when the Republicans controlling the court committee chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go to the ceiling,” Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst, told the news site.
“People say it’s already high, it’s true.
But it could be higher, especially among still undetermined female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Already before Ford’s public testimony with allegations of sexual abuse against the nominated candidate in the Supreme Court, analysts suggested a backlash could follow if the Republicans pushed through the confirmation.
“This has become a confusing touch for the GOP,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote or the final vote or if Kavanaugh gets through, it’s also about how Republicans have handled this and how they have treated it,” Guy Cecil, head of Priorities USA, a group that helps democratic campaigns, told the news channel.
But the Americans in general seem to be divided over who they should believe in the floodwaters of Fords and Kavanaugh's testimony, and the latter seems to be the one they believe most in.
A new YouGov opinion poll shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed in Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh was probably or definitely lying under his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as those from at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh violently attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate to the Supreme Court exposed her genitals to her while attending a party during their time as students at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup aimed at competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people get access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "world domination".
“We have to do it now,” he said about the startup company.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “personal online data store” or a POD.
It can include contact lists, make-lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser at the same time.
What is unique about personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user who can access what type of information.
The company calls it "personal authorization through data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company’s CEO John Bruce, is that the company will bring the resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a number of software developers to work on the project, and a group of volunteer encoders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team did not talk to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change that puts all business models at the forefront overnight.
"We don't ask them for permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web created by Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality in recent months.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and head of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m very optimistic about this new era on the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Priest awarded with Victoria Cross during World War I celebrated
The only priest in the English church to be awarded a Victorian Cross during World War I is now celebrated in his home town 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann received the award for his actions during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on September 29, 1918.
However, he was killed by a shotgun four days later and never learned that he had been awarded the most prestigious British military award.
A memorial was uncovered by his two grandchildren during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the stone would be revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather was awarded the prize.
According to the London Gazette, Lt Col Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918, "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from field and machine guns."
He later rushed up to the shot line and led the line forward with "great courage" before deciding the battle alone.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I could never live up to, but something I’m very humble in front of.”
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid down a crown after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "feels very honored to play a role in the parade" and added that "the courage of a real hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given by many people."
MMA fans stayed up all night watching Bellator 206 and got Greta Gris instead
Imagine this, you’ve stayed up all night watching Bellator 206 just to be refused to watch the main event.
The show from San Jose featured 13 matches, including six on the main chart, and was shown live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 06:00, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet each other, the British viewers were surprised when the program suddenly changed to Greta Gris.
Many were hardly impressed after they had stayed up until the early hours of the morning to watch the game.
A fan on Twitter described the program change to a cartoon children's program as "a sick joke".
“It was the government’s decision that the content wasn’t appropriate so early in the morning, so they had to switch to children’s programs,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s Vice President of Marketing and Communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Greta gray, yes"
Bellator CEO Scott Coker said they will work on their schedule to better include British viewers in the future.
"I think we will be able to find a solution with respect to the reprise," Coker said.
“But it’s six in the morning on a Sunday there and we won’t be able to solve this by Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, the change of program upsets many.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it was actually a matter of state.
I can promise you that it won't happen next time.
We're going to show five games instead of six - as we normally do. We took water over our heads in our quest to satisfy the fans.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels ‘Understanding’ Due to Sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he felt inferior to his comrades during his upbringing because of his sexuality – but that also prompted him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize he wasn’t like everyone else until he went to high school.”
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that he cares less about winning the Olympics after becoming a parent.
The popular show's regular programmer, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
During his one-time appearance on Laverne's first show, Daley tells how he felt "less worthy" than others during his upbringing, because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls".
He said: “This feeling of feeling less valued and feeling differently has been a real source of strength and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “someone,” he said, so he didn’t cheat everyone when they eventually found out about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile advocate for HBT rights and harnessed his performance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to convince more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he took the floor because he felt he had had the chance to be able to live openly without limitations and wanted to give others “hope”.
The triple world champion said that his love of a man - the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "came as a surprise".
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he said the age gap had never been a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" - he participated in his first OS at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age with similar life experience.
The couple became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his "whole life perspective" had changed.
“If you asked me last year, it was all about winning gold,” he said.
"But you know, there are things bigger than Olympic gold medals.
My gold medal is Robbie.”
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he would die and one of the last things he had asked about was whether they got their tickets to the 2012 London Olympics - where he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him: you won't be able to sit on the front row dad," he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn’t until he actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally admitted he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of a home audience in an Olympic arena, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song choice - Proud of Heather Small - a song that had followed him to OS and still gave him sketches.
Desert Island Discs will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson out of shape on the bench during Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will break the record on Sunday as he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but then he has to fix the shape to avoid an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played for the 12th time in a row, was beaten by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the event, as he has often been for the United States, the five-fold winner spent his day between acting hechaklack and training on his game in hopes of having a chance to showcase his abilities.
He has never been the busiest of drivers, not even at the top of his career and the 48-year-old is not in shape in front of the tough track at Le Golf National, where the long butt often misses hard.
It’s not just the track that discourages, in the ninth game on Sunday Mickelson meets champion Francesco Molinari, who together with the newspaper Tommy Fleetwood won all four games this week.
If the Americans, who are 4 points below the 12 singles matches, win at the start, Mickelson’s match can be decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, not because he could say much else.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a blow on my back and left my arm behind and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“His self-confidence is not wrong.
He is a celebrity and he has added so much to these teams during previous seasons and during the past week.
I probably didn’t think he would be able to play two games.
I thought he'd do more, but now it's what it is and we're gonna have to be happy with it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup matches played.
It could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never fully lived up to the heights of his individual results.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, but Furyk said his presence brought other qualities to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he likes to joke with people and he's a good guy to have in the team," he explained.
"I also think the younger players thought it was fun to play against him this week, which was fun to see.
He adds so much more than just games.”
Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the Great Leadership may soon be a mere memory
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead in the last day’s singles in the Ryder Cup can quickly turn into an unpleasant experience.
Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballestero held a five-point lead over the Americans but ultimately won with the least possible margin with the result 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You’re reminded that we led a lot at Valderrama, we led a lot at Brookline where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won with need and tips,” Bjorn said after seeing the 2018 class win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday and leading with 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So the story will prove to me and everyone in the team that this is not over.
Tomorrow we'll give it all.
Go out and do everything right.
This is not over until we see the point on the board.
Our goal is to try to win this cup and that’s where our focus is.
I’ve said it all the time, I’m focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we’re well aware of what’s waiting on the other side – the best players in the world.”
Björn was pleased with his players' achievements on a tough golf course and added: "I would never be able to do this myself.
Tomorrow there will be new challenges.
Tomorrow it is the individual achievements that apply, and it is a completely different matter.
It’s fun to be out with a partner when it’s going well, but when you’re out on your own, your ability as a golfer is fully tested.
It’s the message you need to convey to the players, to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he must also go and get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Björn, opponent Jim Furyk will want the players to perform better individually than they did as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of major reversals during the last days of a competition, both in the winning team in Brookline before he ended up as a loser when Europe drove "Miracle at Medinah".
"I remember every fucking word of it," he said in response to a question asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, had gathered his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but one would like to go out as fast as on Brookline, as on Medinah.
When the pace starts in one direction, there is a lot of pressure on these intermediate matches.
We did our show and placed the guys we wanted to, you know, create some magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the assignment to try to lead the match and meet Rory McIlroy in the top game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter meet the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I went with this group of guys in this order because I think it's enough all the way," Bjorn said of his single choices.
Germany's new warship is postponed again
The German fleet’s newest frigate would have been set up in 2014 to replace warships from the Cold War era, but it will not be set up until at least next year due to faulty systems and high costs, local media reported.
The launch of "Rheinland-Pfalz", the submarine for the all-new Baden-Württemberg frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit magazine citing a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the fleet already in 2014, but the problems that arose after delivery were devastated by the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered by the fleet in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen frigates.
They will include a powerful cannon, a range of air defense and naval missiles, as well as some forging techniques, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to station the newest frigates for up to two years without contact with home ports.
But continuous delays mean that the groundbreaking warships – which allow Germany to project power overseas – are already outdated when commissioned, Die Zeit writes.
The devastating F125 frigate created headlines last year, when the German fleet officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media reported a number of important "software and hardware errors" that rendered the warship worthless if used on a combat mission.
Software shortcomings were particularly important because ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the crew of older Bremen-class frigates.
It was also found that the ship was significantly overweight, resulting in poor performance and limiting the Navy's ability to carry out future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton heavy "Rhineland-Palatinate" is thought to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Apart from incorrect hardware, the price tag of the entire project - including training of the crew - will also become a problem.
It is said to have reached fraudulently <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0x24>3.6 billion) - compared to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion in the start-up stage.
Problems affecting the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in light of the recent warnings that Germany’s naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged that the fleet is actually "beginning to lack fully equipped ships".
The official said that this was a growing problem, as old ships were being dismantled but no replacement ships were supplied.
He regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the navy.
The National Trust listens to the secret life of the flattering mouse
New research carried out on a property in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how flat mice use the landscape in their hunt for food.
We hope that the results will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and help to manage future conservation activities.
The study, carried out by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland, will follow southern and dwarf spears as well as brown elongated and Daubenton flattering mice at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in important locations around the property to track flattened mouse activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of flattened mouse sounds and which species do what.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed area picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS’s nature-care adviser, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important for flat rats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of environmental management work such as the creation of meadows and the best way to maintain forest lands for flat mice and other related species.
Fladder mice populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom have declined considerably over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects bone and loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as well as aircraft and certain chemical treatments of building materials as well as attacks from households.
Fladder mice are actually not blind.
But because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching the swap.
They use sophisticated eco-localization technology to find insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes flattery mice very seriously.
The organization has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct investigations, check bones and sometimes perform rescue operations.
The organization has also established Scotland’s first and only dedicated flattery reserve at Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s ten flattery species.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal area for them.
"Here at Threave we have a good area for flat mice," he said.
"We have the old buildings, lots of veteran trees and a variety of favorable habitats.
But there is a lot about flattery mice that is still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties helps us understand more about what they need to thrive.
He stresses the importance of searching for flat mice before performing maintenance within properties, as it is possible that accidental destruction of a single residence could kill up to 400 females and young, and possibly eradicate an entire population.
Fladder mice are peaceful and it is illegal to kill, disturb or disturb them or destroy their bones.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer for the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our flat mice and for many of our species we don't know how their populations feel."
Ronaldo rejects rape as his lawyers threaten to vote for German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape charges against him "fake news" and says people "will market themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers will vote for the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
Portugal and Juventus forward have been charged with raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid her <0x24>375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a live video on Instagram, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the reports as “fake news” when he spoke to his 142 million followers, just hours after the claims were reported.
"Don't give her to her.
What they said today was fake news," the five-fold Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
“They want to promote themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be known by using my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," said the player and laughed.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to vote Der Spiegel on the allegations, which they have called “unauthorized reporting of suspicions of privacy,” according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damages at an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident is said to have taken place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he reportedly raped her anal, according to documents filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" betrayal of the "highest percentage".
According to the documents, Ronaldo had confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was with consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took photographs of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed on a settlement because she felt "fear of retaliation" and was concerned about "being humiliated in public".
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to end the conciliation because she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault, and this summer he moved to the Italian giant Juve in an agreement of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: Britain 'will forever regret' losing car manufacturers
Britain "would regret it forever" if it lost its status as a world leader in automotive manufacturing after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was “unreasonable” that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily cease production at the Burnaston plant near Derby.
"We need an agreement," Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker announced that the effects of delays at the border in the event of no agreement being concluded could result in lost jobs.
The Burnaston plant – which manufactures Toyota’s Auris and Avensis – produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
“My opinion is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production stops in our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s CEO at Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have communicated their concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW says, for example, it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main problems are what automakers say are risks to the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is operated on a “just-in-time” basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars ordered.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29, it could lead to disruptions at the border that the industry says could lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day’s consumption in stock at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, and therefore production would be forced to stop.
Clark said Theresa May’s Chequer’s plan for future relations with the EU is “exactly calibrated to avoid checks at the border.”
"We need a settlement. We want the best deal that enables, as I say, not only success at the moment to be appreciated now, but for us to take this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
“The statements from not only Toyota but other manufacturers are that we absolutely need to be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production would stop, but in the longer term warned that increased costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the leader of the Unite trade union at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “My experience is that these jobs will never come back.
A government official said: "We have presented an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump’s meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could be “shooted in another week” as the fight against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein is monitoring the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the election, relations between Trump and Russia and the president’s potential obstruction to justice.
Whether Trump will fire the Assistant Justice Minister, thereby jeopardizing Mueller’s independence, has fueled Washington squads for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing earphones to record conversations with Trump as well as the possibility of deposing the president through the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House, and reports that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York, to be held on Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer" not to fire Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a conflict with the Senate legal committee hearings where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual irregularity, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of charges against Kavanaugh, further delaying a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, spoke in Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "A date for it has not been set, it can happen this week, or a postponement of a week in view of all other cases happening at the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see, and I always like to keep the press updated.”
Some reporters would challenge this claim: Sanders hasn’t had a White House press conference since September 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not due to anything displeasing to TV reporters who "play for the gallery", although she said, "I agree with the fact that they play for the gallery."
She then said direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president holds more questioning sessions than any president before him," she said, adding without citing evidence: "We have looked at these figures."
The conferences will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press gets the chance to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, it's infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to do this often and you have seen us do a lot in recent weeks and it will replace press conferences, and then you can ask questions directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president perhaps showed why, with spontaneous statements and sometimes bizarre appearances in front of the assembled reporters.
Minister of Health writes to EU staff at NHS Scotland regarding Brexit concerns
The Minister of Health has written to EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS to express Scotland’s gratitude and desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter less than six months before Britain withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to cover the costs of terminated status applications for EU citizens working in the decentralised public sector.
In the letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal have continued, ahead of decisions expected to come in the fall.
But the British government has also intensified its preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I know this must be a very worrying time for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to reiterate how much I value each employee’s efforts, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and the rest of the world, provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after he suffered a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers lineback Christion Abercrombie underwent an acute operation after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennesseans reported Mike Organ.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
“He came to the sideline and just collapsed,” Reed said.
Coach and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before he was placed on a bar was carried out for further evaluation.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no data on the type/range of injury yet" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year redshirt student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, giving him a seasonal total of 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers are allowed to pay higher stamp tax when buying property in the UK, and the extra money is used to help homeless people, according to the Tory Party’s new plans
The measure aims to neutralize Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters
The increase in the stamp tax will apply to those who do not pay tax in the UK
The UK Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be allowed to pay a higher stamp tax when buying property in the UK. The extra money will be used to help homeless people, which will be announced by Prime Minister Theresa May today.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters with promises of more affordable housing and targeting high-income earners.
The increase of the stamp tax will be taken from individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK. The extras will give a boost to the government's efforts to combat homelessness.
The additional fee will be added in addition to the current stamp tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on holiday homes and apartments purchased for rent, which can be up to 3%.
The Ministry of Finance believes that the measure will withdraw up to 120 million pounds per year.
An estimated 13 percent of the newly built properties in London are purchased by people living outside the UK, which increases prices and makes it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot in the housing market.
Many well-established areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become ghost cities due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new show comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the stamp tax to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping prices up by buying up land without using it, and urged Theresa May to refrain from quotas on affordable housing in order to solve Britain's "sad housing situation."
Jeremy Corbyn has launched an eye-catching range of housing reform proposals, including rent ceilings and an end to bills without the tenant’s dismissal.
He also wants to give municipalities more opportunities to build new homes.
Theresa May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream that life will be better for every new generation.
This means solving the problems in the housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it can’t be right to when it’s as easy for people who don’t live in the UK, and also for companies based abroad, to buy homes that are too hard-working residents in our country.
The dream of owning a home has become just a distant dream for too many people, and homelessness is still an unworthy fact.”
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to train Scotland"
Sunderland leader Jack Ross says his "final goal" is to ever become Scotland's coach.
The 42-year-old is looking forward to the challenge of inflating the club from northeast England, which is currently third in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer after bringing St Mirren back to Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I played a match in the B national team and that’s all,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportssound.
“But when I grew up, I watched a lot of Scotland on the Hampden with my dad, and it has always attracted me back.
But that chance can only come if I manage to lead a club.”
Representatives of Ross as coach for Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic leader says he was not worried about succeeding such established names in such a big club. He has previously refused offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“I’m currently assessing success based on the answer to the question, ‘Can I get this club back to the Premier League?’
“This club is absolutely part of the Premier League, given its structure and talents,” he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably just see myself as successful here if I could get the club back there."
Ross has only been a coach for three years, after a period as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and a 15-month stay as a member of the Hearts coaching team.
Then he helped Alloa come back from relocating to the third division, lifting St Mirren from being close to relocating to becoming the championship title winner the following season.
Ross says he is more satisfied now than ever during his playing career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a roadside cause," he recalls, referring to when he took command of Alloa.
“I really thought leadership was right for me, in a completely different way than playing.
That sounds weird, because I had good results and could live up to it, and I had some great successes.
But playing can be tough.
There is a lot to be done every week.
It’s still stress and pressure at work for me, but exercising feels absolutely right.
I've always wanted to work out and now I'm doing it. I feel better than I've ever done in my whole adult life."

A survey shows that the perfect time to take a beer is 17:30 on a Saturday
The summer heat wave has resulted in increased revenues for the country’s struggling pubs, but the restaurant chains have been under greater pressure.
The figures showed that pub and bar groups increased sales by 2.7% in July, but the revenues of restaurants fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin of CGA, who compiled the figures, said: "The continued beautiful weather and the fact that England remained in the World Cup longer than expected meant that we were able to see a similar pattern in July compared to June, when the pubs went up by 2.8%.
The decline in restaurants’ turnover by 1.8% in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars that mainly offer drinks showed the absolute best result with figures for the same period last year that had gone up more than the restaurants had gone down.
Pubs that offer food also had difficulty in the beautiful weather, although it was not as dramatic as for restaurant lovers.
People just seem to want to go out and drink something.
The output of managed pubs and bars increased beverage sales by 6.6% that month, and food sales by 3%."
Paul Newman, RSM’s services and entertainment analyst, said: “These results are a continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and major sporting events are still the most important factors when it comes to sales in the large kitchen market.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups are still experiencing difficulties, although a 4.8% annual sales decline is particularly difficult to deal with in addition to ongoing cost pressures.
The long, hot summer could not have come more inappropriate for food-sales-driven companies. Time can show whether the more moderate temperatures we had in August give a well-needed respite."
The total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened establishments, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the fact that fewer new brands are now being launched.
Industry Sales Monitor Coffer Peach Tracker for the UK bar and restaurant industry collects and analyzes data on how 47 active groups with a total turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion are doing, and is an established benchmark in the industry.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One in five children, sometimes as young as 11 years old, have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school and high school students shows an increase in the number of fake Instagram pages
The result has increased concerns that sexual content is posted there.
20% of students said they had a “main account” that they showed to their parents.
One in five children, some as young as 11, create social media accounts that they keep secret for adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school and high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of “fake Instagram accounts,” a reference to Instagram’s image sharing service.
The result has slowed down on concerns that sexual content is posted there.
20% of students said they had a cleaned “main account” that they could show to their parents, and they also have private accounts.
A mother who crawled over her 13-year-old daughter’s secret side found a teenager who urged others to “violete me.”
According to the study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of children between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted that they had private accounts.
HMC chairman Mike Buchanan says, “It’s worrying that so many teens are attracted to creating places on the Internet where parents and teachers don’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of athletes" on the board of the Scottish Athletics Association, Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of Scottish Athletics as an external board member at the annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most acclaimed freelancer, and President Ian Beattie describes the election as an outstanding opportunity for those leading the sport to benefit from her wide international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh has gained great respect throughout the Scottish, British and international sports worlds, and we are confident that the athletes in Scotland would benefit greatly from becoming a member of the board," Beattie said.
Doyle says: “I would like to be a voice for athletes and I hope I can help and lead the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, has a total of four Olympic golds and is now an expert commentator on the BBC.
He tweeted: “Today, a month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that the time had to tell me if I was going to recover, and to what extent.
It’s been hard work, but I’ve recovered completely, taught me to walk again and now I’m doing mobility exercises!
Thank you for all your encouragement!”
Advertising for breast pumps that compare moms with cows sharing the internet
A company that sells breast pumps has caused disagreements on the internet with an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers with cows being milked.
To pay attention to the launch of what is said to be the world’s first silent portable breast pump, consumer technology company Elvie has released a music video-inspired commercial with humorous assumptions to show the freedom of the new pump to mothers pumping breast milk.
Four real moms dance in a stuffed pack of cows to a song with rows of lyrics like, "Yes, I'm breastfeeding myself, but I don't have a tail" and "If you didn't know it, this is not juicing, it's tits."
The refrigerator continues, "Pump out, pump out, I feed the babies, pump out, pump out, I milk the ladies."
But the commercial, which has been published on the company’s Facebook page, has caused conflict on the internet.
The film has received 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, and has faced mixed reactions from viewers. Many say it sheds light on the "fase" of the dairy industry.
“It’s a very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
Just like we have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are taken from them just a few days after birth.”

Another comments: “You understand that it is traumatic for both mother and child.
But, of course, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?”
Another one adds: "What a reality-needed advertising film. "
Others defend the film, and a woman admits that she thinks the song is "hysterically funny."
“I think this is genius.
I would have had one if I were still breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The commercial is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a brilliant product,” someone wrote.
Another comments: "This is a funny commercial film that addresses moms who pump (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like 'kissing'."
This is not a film that praises or condemns the dairy industry.”
At the end of the film, the women reveal that they have all danced with the discreet pump stuck in their thighs.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the fact that many women who pump milk say they feel like cows.
But the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no cables or pipes and can be worn discreetly in a breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin is an ECD at Mother, and she says, “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between women pumping breast milk and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight breast pumping and the challenges with it, while at the same time showing in an entertaining and easily recognizable way the incredible sense of freedom the new pump provides.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has created headlines.
During London’s fashion week, a two-child mom appeared on the catwalk with clothes from designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved quietly to a tent camp near Texas border
The number of migrant children deprived of their liberty has increased even though the number of people crossing the border each month is relatively unchanged, partly because the heinous rhetoric and harsh policies imposed by the Trump administration have made it difficult to place the children with reference persons.
In the past, most reference persons themselves have been paperless immigrants, and are afraid to put their own opportunities to stay in the country at risk by declaring themselves willing to accept a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential reference persons and other adult members of the household would be forced to leave fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Authority, testified to the congress that the authority had arrested dozens of people who had applied to be reference persons for single minors.
The Authority later confirmed that 70% of those arrested were not known to the law enforcement authorities in the past.
Almost 80% of the persons who are either reference persons themselves or family members of reference persons are illegally located in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminal foreigners.
So we continue to persecute these individuals,” Albence said.
In order to deal with the cases of children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month after they were detained, rather than after 60 days, as was previously practiced, according to staff at the establishments.
Many of them are present on video links rather than in person to bring their claim for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are not deemed to be entitled to protection are deported quickly.
The longer children are deprived of their liberty, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbreaks or attempted escape, according to staff at the departments and reports that have come from the system in recent months.
Proponents say concern increases at larger facilities such as Tornillo, where signs that a child has it are more likely to be ignored, due to the size of the facility.
They add that if children are moved to the tent town without having enough time to prepare emotionally and say goodbye to friends can aggravate the traumas many are already injured with.
Syria calls for U.S., French and Turkish "occupation forces" to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the war in the country being in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretense of fighting terrorism, and "will be handled accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the General Assembly.
Moualem stressed that "the war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said the Damascus government would continue to "fight this holy battle until we have liberated all Syrian territories" both from terrorist groups and "all illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
As for the refugees, Moualem said the circumstances are good for them to come home, accusing "certain Western countries" of "spreading irrational fear" that enables refugees to stay away.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return,” he said.
“They are policing something that should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no aid to rebuild Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a fresh agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the last major rebel fortress of Idlib has created an opportunity to move forward with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement dispelled a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian troops against the province, which has three million inhabitants.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines", and expressed hope that a military intervention would be directed against jihadists, including warriors from the Al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, which "will be wiped out".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee consisting of members of government and members of the opposition, to make a draft post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set out conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the group's work would be limited to "revision of the articles of the current constitution", and warned of interference.
Why Donald Trump Will Win a Re-election
With that logic, Donald Trump would win the 2020 re-election if his presidency was not terminated in advance by law and scandal, which many liberal viewers are likely to hope for.
In what would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of a presidency ever!”
At the moment, there are no signs that the viewers are tired.
Since 2014, the number of viewers at best broadcast time has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN, and is almost three times as high as 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at best broadcast time, an increase from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has peaked on the list of cable channels with as many as 3.5 million viewers during major news nights.
"This is like a fire that people are drawn to, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, who runs the show for ABC's "Designated Survivor" drama, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack has destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell is a longtime comedy writer and has written "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club".
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Donald Trump.
Why then? she asked.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Nell Scovell told me.
In the chaos there is an entertainment value.
Of course, unlike everything else on TV, the Washington report can determine the future of the legal case in the abortion issue, Roe vs Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite and the global economy’s prosperity.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Still, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you have suddenly sucked and looked for six hours at an expert panel debating Bob Woodward's use of "deep background sources" for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's Trump bomber jacket for <0x24>15,000," the macaroni post, the anambroidery in anambroidery, and Daniel's full of clothes.
I will never see Super Mario again in the same way.
"Part of what he does that makes it feel like a reality show is that he comes with something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about the Trump escort's rotating crew and daily intrigues (much of a quarrel with the NFL, said Kim-loved.
If you miss a single episode, you end up in the aftermath.
When I spoke to TV producer Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sun and 27 degrees outside his house in northern Kauai in Hawaii, but he sat down and stared inside and watched MSNBC while recording a broadcast from CNN.
He could not bear it, not when Brett Kavanaugh would face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was in the waistcoat.
“I remember when we did all those crazy programs in the past and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Money from outside flows into the most balanced race ever before the mid-term elections
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th congressional district receives a lot of money, thanks to the restructuring of a congressional district that has now led two members to compete for the same seat.
This recently relocated suburban district in Pittsburgh is represented by Democrat Conor Lamb, who took his place in another district at a special election last spring.
Lamb campaigns against another member, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps the new 17th district.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were constitutionally largely changed in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has caused a campaign funding dispute between the major parties' economic sections, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a short win in a broadly guarded special election in March to Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district.
The site had been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts had given the Democrats a certain lead.
U.S. considers punishing El Salvador for China's support but backs
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Donald Trump had a hot meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama, until the delegates dragged the Trump organization’s leadership team.
U.S. State Department officials decided to call home the heads of U.S. missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “newly made decisions not to recognize Taiwan anymore,” said U.S. Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert in a statement earlier this month.
However, only sanctions were planned against El Salvador, which received an estimated <0x24>140 million in US aid in 2017, including funds for drug control and development and financial support.
The proposed sanctions, including the reduction of financial assistance and visa restrictions, would have hit the Central American country hard with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
As the internal meetings continued, U.S. and Central American officials set up a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step in the right direction to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, effectively stopping considerations of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence will now speak at the conference, which will now be held in mid-October, a sign of the importance of the meeting by the presidential administration, the diplomats said.
And the three U.S. embassies quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh messages or penalties from Washington.
A White House spokesman for John Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal discussions against the promise of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an outside analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke anonymously.
Study the history
The next inevitable step could be the special investigator Robert Mueller’s report on Donald Trump’s alleged abuse in lawsuits, which there is now concrete evidence in public records.
Mueller is also reported to be directing his investigation against whether Donald Trump’s campaign cooperated with Russia in its attack on the US election.
If Congress would change the majority, Trump will be held accountable to that assembly just as he prepares to stand up again in the election, and perhaps finally to a citizen jury.
There are many insecure factors in this, and I do not want to say that Trump will inevitably fall, nor do his colleagues in Europe.
We all have to make different choices, on both sides of the Atlantic, which will influence how long the fight can be.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler, if only the Western countries had resisted him and stood behind the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of bloodbaths that followed.
History revolves around such decisive events, and the inexorable progress of democracy is either accelerated or slowed down.
The Americans are now facing several of these decisive events.
What will we do if Donald Trump gives Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls what will happen to Mueller's investigation, fired?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this newspaper reported that he had proposed to secretly record the president last year, and speculated that he would not be suitable for the office.
Rosenstein says The Times reporting is not true.
"How are we going to respond if the recently requested FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair, or if he is allowed to appear in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And above all, will we in the mid-term elections vote for a Congress that holds Donald Trump accountable?
If we fail in these trials, democracy faces a dark period.
But I do not think we will fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador’s residence.
She survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me on my way to light the Sabbath lights on the table decorated with the hammer cross.
With that as a legacy, how could I be anything but optimistic about the future?”

Graham Dorrans in Rangers is optimistic about meeting with Rapid Wien
The Rangers will receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday and know that their victory against the Austrians after the impressive Spain match against Villarreal that ended the draw earlier this month will put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance for the season, up to the 2-2 game against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use the result as a leap for greater success.
“It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team,” says the 31-year-old.
“We went into the game believing we could get something, and we went out with a point.
We might have gotten it in the end, but overall it was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half. We came back in the second half and we were better in the team.
Thursday will be an important night in Europe again.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough match. They got a good result in their last match, but if we have the audience with us, we can certainly get a good result.
Last year was very tough, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes in the club, but now we have a good feeling.
The team is good and the guys have fun, the training is good.
Hopefully we can move forward now, put the previous season behind us and succeed well.”
Women sleep poorly due to fear of pension savings
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear picture of how they wanted to be taken care of, few were talking to their family members about it.
Approximately half of the people who participated in the nationwide study said they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% said they had spoken to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t take the step and talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's how you can start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of yourself unless you talk about how you want it in good time.
Work with your advisor and your family and discuss where and how you want care. Your choices can have a big impact on the costs.
Get help from your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for the costs.
Your choices of long-term care financing may include a traditional long-term care insurance solution, a hybrid life-value insurance solution to cover the costs, or self-insurance with your own funds, if you can afford it.
Establish legal documents: Avoid legal disputes from the beginning.
Establish a healthcare authority, so that you can appoint a trusted person who oversees your medical care and ensures that the healthcare staff follows your wishes, if you become unable to communicate.
Also consider an authority for your economy.
You then choose a trusted person who can make financial decisions in your place and make sure your bills are paid if you yourself are incapable.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that you have an elderly parent who ends up in an emergency medical condition and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down such details so that you are ready.
“It’s not just the economy at stake, but who are the doctors?” he asked.
“What medicines are they?
Who takes care of the dog?
Make sure the plan is ready.”
Man shot several times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle as he walked home from an outing night.
The victim, who is in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
The police described the shooting, which took place around 2:30 p.m., as a "single incident".
The victim did not see his attacker.
The injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are urging witnesses to hear from them.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials say. The death toll is expected to rise.
Communications have been discontinued, and rescue personnel have not yet been able to obtain any information from the administrative area of Donggala, an area north of Palu closest to the epicenter of the earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some facts about Palu and Dongala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, and is located in a dense bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. The city's population was estimated to be 379,800 people in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is an administrative area that extends along more than 300 km of the northwest coast of Sulawesi.
The administrative area, which is an administrative region under a province, in 2017 had an estimated population of 299,200 people.
The pillars of the economy of the province of Central Sulawesi are fisheries and agriculture, in particular the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also significant in the province, but it is mainly concentrated to Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past hundred years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Management Authority.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
Also in 1996, western Donggala was hit by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Circum-Pacific seismic quake, which is often affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami affecting 14 countries. 226,000 people died along the Indian Ocean coast. More than half of them were in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the West Coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of magnitude 6.8 on the Richter Scale struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that struck the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 hit near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 struck one of the Mentawai Islands outside Sumatra. A tsunami of up to ten meters was triggered. Dozens of villages were destroyed and around 300 people were killed.
2016: A major earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya administration area in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, as people were reminded of the devastation of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
This time, no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people were killed by buildings that collapsed.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok. More than 500 people died, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily beached.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of abuse.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, for lying in a report of domestic violence and for opposing the arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he allegedly picked up the phone from a female acquaintance who tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes.
Palin is deprived of his liberty in the Mat-Su suit and is held against the <0x24>500 bail to be paid if the suspect violates the terms of the bail, according to the TV channel KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself "guaranteed not guilty" when he was asked to state his position, according to the TV channel.
Palin is suspected in three cases of less serious Class A crimes, which means he can be imprisoned for up to a year and <0x24>250,000 in fines.
He has also been charged with a case of less serious Class B crime, which is punishable by a day in prison and <0x24>2,000 in fines.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with crimes.
In December 2017, he was charged with violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged crime.
The case is now being handled by the Alaska Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of lying in the report of domestic violence and of possession of weapons under influence in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accuses him of hitting her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress syndrome, which stems from his military service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia on Friday.
The earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the Richter scale, triggered a tsunami and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Electricity and communications are down, and deaths are expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake hit just outside central Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
Movies that show when it hit are now circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutors Call for Rare Death Penalty for Suspect of Terrorist Attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspected terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people. It is a rare punishment that has not been executed for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is said to have used a rented truck from the construction and interior chain Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan. He slammed pedestrians and cyclists in his way at the attack, which took place in October.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily injury, according to the statement of intent on the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both allegations can result in a death sentence, according to the court case.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was charged by a federal jury of 22 points, including eight murders to support protective activities, which are often used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, as well as trafficking and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded "extensive planning and purpose," the prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried out it as "abhorrent, cruel and inhuman".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused family and friends to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco damage and loss," the statement reads.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
New York’s southern district has not filed a lawsuit for a decade.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was arrested for the murder of two drug traffickers, but eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal trial in New York was 1953. The married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of stamping into espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The couple Rosenberg were both executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who is a Uzbek citizen, showed a lack of remorse during the days and months following the attack, according to the court documents.
According to police, he told the investigators that he was happy with what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by the attack after watching IS movies on his phone.
He also asked to set up the IS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He has not pleaded guilty to the 22 allegations in the prosecution.
David Patton is one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, who said they are "obviously disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to apply for the death penalty instead of accepting life imprisonment without the possibility of parole if the defendant pleads guilty only prolongs the trauma that these events have caused to all those involved,” Patton said.
Saipo’s defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Tories MP says Nigel Farage should take responsibility for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the army of the people" today during a protest at the Tories conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians must “feel the heat” of EU skeptics when one of Theresa May’s own MPs suggested he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham march that Britain would already "should have gone out" if Nigel Farage had been Brexit minister.
But the challenge faced by Theresa May to get the deeply divided supporters to reconcile has been exacerbated by EU-positive Tory members, who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep his compromise plan, the Chequers agreement, alive under attacks from Brexit supporters, people who want to stay in the Union and the EU itself.
Her allies have insisted that she should press and try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the backlash, and force EU skeptics and the Labour Party to choose between her package solution and "chaos".
Bone said at a mass meeting organised by the organisation Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to "spoil the Chequers agreement".
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been made equal and had responsibilities in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been standing at the wheel, we would have been out at this team," he said.
Peter Bone, who represents the Wellingborough district in parliament, added: "I will stand up for Brexit, but we have to cancel the Chequers agreement."
He clarified his opposition to the European Union and said: "We have not fought a world war to become subjects.
We want to establish our own laws in our own country.”
Bone rejected the allegations that public opinion would have changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British would have changed and now want to stay is completely false."
Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns of the Tory Party also attended the march and spoke to the journalists. "I just want to say, 'Prime Minister, listen to the people.'
The Chequers agreement is unpopular with the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular with the party and with our voters who are out on the streets and make sure we are elected.
Take off the Chequers deal and start listening."
And she added a sharp message to Theresa May: “Prime Ministers must keep their jobs while they keep their promises.”
Nigel Farage said at the meeting that politicians need to be “feel the heat” if they are to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s about trust between us, the people, and the political class,” he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, 'We're not going to let you get away with it.'
In front of the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to get our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, to feel the heat.
We are mobilizing the army of the people in this country that gave us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud UK.”
At the same time, EU supporters marched through Birmingham and then held a two-hour mass meeting in the city center.
A group of activists floated with tracks with the text "Tory members against Brexit" after the group was launched this weekend.
Labour MP Lord Adonis of the House of Commons mocked the Conservatives for the security issues they encountered with a party app when the conference opened.
“It’s these people who say they can have IT systems and all technology in place for Canada plus plus plus agreement, for frictionless borders and free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a pure dad.
There is no good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans a "ordinary thinker" to run for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will take on a "ordinary thinker about running for president" after the November election.
Boston Globe reports that Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at a city council meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren has often criticized President Donald Trump, and is now posing for re-election in November against Republican state representative Geoff Diehl, who was vice president of Donald Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been the subject of speculation that she may be taking on Donald Trump 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th mayoral meeting with voters since Donald Trump stepped in.
Someone asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren replied that it's time "for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government. That means a woman at the top."
A person arrested for the shooting of the basketball player Sims from LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested for the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Police in Baton Rouge announced that Dyteon Simpson, 20, had been arrested at a press conference at 11:00 ET.
They had released a film of the shooting on Friday to help identify a man who was seen in the photos.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot to death near Southern University campus early on Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and eventually died of this," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday via the news site 247 sports.
Wayde went in the middle to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he had been on the spot and had a gun, and he admitted that he had shot the Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to the East Baton Rouge police station.
Sims was a junior player, 198 cm tall and grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games with 10 starts last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 returns per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches World Championship title after team orders gave him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes' team orders would play a major role in the race.
Bottas got a good start and almost hanged Hamilton out on dry ground as he defended his position during the first two yards, and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went up first and let Hamilton drive in the back of the cylinder, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went on a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward after a little wheel-to-wheel action where the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside with the risk of inviting in place after a double draw to defend himself in the third lap.
Max Verstappen started in the rear row and fell seven at the end of the first yard on his 21st birthday.
He then led a large part of the race and kept on the tyres to reach a fast goal and drive over Kimi Raikkonen and become four.
In the end, he landed on the 44th yard but failed to raise the pace during the remaining eight yards when Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's a tough day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me pass.
The team has done an exceptional job and got one and two,” Hamilton said.
Really Bad Body Language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a mass meeting on Saturday, for insisting that she has not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated as a judge in the Supreme Court, is accused of sexual abuse.
The president, speaking at a mass meeting in West Virginia, did not directly raise Ford's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee, but commented that what went on in the Senate showed that people were "alone, untrue, and lying."
“The only thing that could have happened and the good that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry, bad, dirty, and lying,” he said.
“You see press releases and leaks and they say, ‘No, I haven’t done it.
I haven't done it."
Do you remember?
Did you run out, Dianne Feinstein?
Do you remember her answer? 'Have you leaked the document?' 'Oh, what?'
Oh, no.
I haven't leaked it."
Wait a minute.
'We have leaked... No, we have not leaked anything,' he added, imitating the senator.
The letter detailing Ford's charges against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July, and leaked in September, but Feinstein denied the leak would have come from her office.
"I have not obscured Ford's allegations, I have not leaked her story," Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep this confidential, and I kept it as confidential as she wanted.”
But her dementia does not seem to have matched the president, who commented this way during Saturday night's meeting: "I'll tell you one thing. That was really bad body language.
She may not have done it, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continues to support the candidate for the Supreme Court, who has been charged with sexual offences by three women, and he suggested that the Democrats used the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back power by all necessary means.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to drive over to gain power and control,” the president told the digital news site Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars-Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Belfast Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars scored Friday's loss in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning the return game with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Belfast Giants got an early two-match lead through Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie paid off for the home game before Dwyer restored Belfast Giants leadership.
Francois Bouchard cleared for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League for the season for Adam Keefe's team, who came from behind and beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season for the two teams, and the Belfast Giants had won the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on assist from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford gave assist when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In the intensive first period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt delivered to Cownie who cleared at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Belfast Giants were in the lead at the first break when he made his second goal for the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard cleared once again with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the match at the end of the second period, and he secured the win with his team's fifth half through the final period.
The Belfast Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Flight guides die because hundreds of people on one plane could escape from earthquake
A flight attendant in Indonesia is now hailed as a hero after he died when he saw that a plane with hundreds of people on board could lift safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake hit Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks continue to plague the area and many are stuck in the hustle and bustle of the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wildly swinging control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed to make sure that Batik Air’s flight 6321, which was then on the start track, could lift safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it was going to rage.
He later died in the hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian television channel ABC News.
“We arranged a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
We are devastated to hear this,” he added.
At the same time, authorities fear the death toll could reach more than a thousand people, and the country's disaster relief agency says there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The death toll is believed to continue to rise because there are still many bodies left in the ruins, and many have not been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Up to six meters high waves have devastated Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are flying in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance comes with dead bodies.
It's bad for clean water.
Mini-markets are plundered everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is fighting to help survivors, but we don't know what they will meet from there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday, saying to the country's military: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?” according to CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says a man is missing after a plane crashes in a lagoon
The airline responsible for the plane that crashed in a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific now states that a man is missing. Previously it was said that all 47 passengers and crew had been extinct from the declining plane and were safe.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger was still missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to questions about more details about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water as it attempted to land at the airport on the Chuu Islands.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and that their condition was stable.
It is still unclear what caused the crash and what the course of the event looked like.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both stated that the plane landed in the lagoon without reaching the landing track.
Some witnesses believed that the plane glided past the landing track.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane flew in very low.
"It's extremely good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to travel through mid-depth water to the emergency outlets on the descending plane.
He said that the cabin crew panicked and shouted, and that he had a minor skull injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working in the vicinity of developing a shipyard also helped in the rescue work by using an inflatable boat to drive people on land before the plane sank into the 30-meter deep water.
Aviation Safety Network data shows that 111 people have died in accidents with airlines registered in Papua New Guinea in the past two years, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any of them.
Analysts draw a timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor’s office on Saturday concluded his plea in the second trial against a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi living in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett spoke for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he had used cell phone lists to puzzle the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers' movements the night she died.
Rowlett said he had received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contrary to his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chamber's cell phone during the time he said he had been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis stated that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile phone lists showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis, some time after Chambers' death, deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He killed her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final presentation on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later on the same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol thinks that the hip hop has come a long way from its origins in political messages and to attack social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently received a boost in the UK through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
A black one again?
A New York babysitter votes for a couple over resignation after a "racist" text message
A New York girl voted for a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she received a wrong text message from her mother, who complained that she was "a black again".
The couple denied that they would be racist and compared the mood to "extortion".
Two-child mom Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her horror when she realized that the new baby girl Giselle Maurice was black when she arrived on her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEJ IS NOT A BLACK ONE," Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a text message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice, twice.
After realizing her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman was "just to the mods", and fired Maurice, claiming that their former child girl, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that instead she expected a Filipino woman, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one day's work and sent home in a taxi.
Now she's in charge of the couple to get compensation for the dismissal. She requests compensation in the order of <0x24>350 per day for the job she was initially hired to do, which would be for six months and where she would live with the couple. However, she had no contract.
"I want to show them that you don't do that," she told the New York Post on Friday. "I know it's discrimination."
The couple dismiss the accusations that they would be racist and say that the only straight thing was to end Giselle Maurice's job. They were worried that they could not trust her when they had insulted her.
"My wife had sent her something she didn't mean.
She's not racist.
We’re not racists,” Joel Plasco told the New York Post.
"But would you entrust your children to someone you would have been disrespectful to, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Seriously."
Plasco compared the mood to "extortion" and said that his wife would give birth two months later and was in a "very difficult situation".
“Are you going to give yourself to such a person?
It’s not very nicely done,” added investment banker Plasco.
The legal process is still ongoing, but the public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media and criticized them for their behavior and reasoning.
Paddington publishers did not believe readers could relate to a speaking bear, reveals a new letter
Michael Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was adopted, commented on the letter as follows: "It's hard to think about how it was for a person who read it for the first time before it was released.
It’s very funny, given what we now know about Paddington’s great success.”
She told me that her father, who had worked as a cameraman on the BBC before he was inspired by a little toy bear to write the children's book, had been optimistic when his work was rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the first edition was "bitterly delighted" after his death.
She describes Paddington as a "very important member of our family", adding that her father was proud of the silence over his final success.
"He was quite silent of himself, and not a proud person," she said.
"But Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child that succeeds in something. One becomes proud of the child even if it is not the man himself who has achieved it.
I think he saw Paddington's success a little bit in that way.
Even though it was his creation and his imagination, he always gave Paddington the honour himself.”
My daughter would die, and I got to say goodbye on the phone
When she landed, her daughter had been taken to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“They called regularly to say that it was really bad, and that they didn’t expect her to be okay,” Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got a call from Nad who said she was going to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "I love you so much, Tashi, my darling.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll come to you.
The medicines that the doctors had given her to keep her heart alive ebbed out slowly and left her body.
She had died just before, and now everything was gone.
I just got to sit there and wait and know that all this happened.
I couldn’t cry or cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to bring myself together.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, who were completely unaware of the difficult trials she had undergone.
"No one knew about it," she said.
“I bent my head down, and my tears ran all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight I felt an overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Breastfeeding Women Set Up Postcards to Prevent Suicide on Bridge
Two women who have lost relatives because of suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up cards on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and phone numbers that you can call to get support.
Sharon Davis's son Tyler was 13 when he began suffering from depression, and took his life when he was 18.
“I don’t want any parents to feel as bad as I do every day,” she says.
Sharon Davis, 45, lives in Lydney and tells her son that she was a promising cook who had a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew who he was because of his smile.
They said his smile illuminated the room.”
But he stopped working before he died, because he was "in a very dark place."
Tyler’s brother, then 11, was the one who found his brother when he killed himself in 2014.
Sharon Davis says, "I'm always worried about consequences."
Sharon Davis created the cards “to let people know that there are people you can go and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t sit still, talk about it.”
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, lost her partner 15 years ago, Mark, a time after his mother's death.
“He hadn’t said he felt depressed or depressed or anything,” she says.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed that he was acting differently.
On Christmas day, he was at the bottom, and when the kids opened their Christmas presents, he had no eye contact with them or anything."
She says his death was a very hard blow to them, but they have to go through it. "It shatters a wound in the family.
It's crushing us.
But we all have to fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake when FBI launches investigation
"I thought that if we could achieve something similar to what he asked for -- an investigation that is limited in time and scope -- maybe we could get a little consensus," said Jeff Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would be "divided" because of deeply rooted party divisions.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate the case?
Their resilience depends entirely on the timing.
If Republicans make a bad choice, which is expected, they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the person they want to choose in the country’s highest court.
George W. Bush has taken the phone and called senators to influence them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was the personal secretary of George W. Bush.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the deadlock and confirm his incursion in the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean smugglers 'slows' under Kim
The number of North Koreans who jump to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Reunification, says 1,127 people jumped from last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park says tougher border controls between North Korea and China, as well as higher fees for human traffickers, are important causes.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean buyers are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
More than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them fly through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and whose border is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korea states.
China sees the smugglers as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often sends them back by force.
The North-South relations, which are technically still at war with each other, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focusing on the ongoing negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This happened after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in general terms to work for the Korean peninsula to be free from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the U.S. of the lack of success since then.
"Without trust for the United States, there is no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances we can absolutely not disarm ourselves unilaterally first," Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court
The minority leader of the House, Nancy Pelosi, called the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was temperamentally inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi's comments came in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had behaved like this, she would be called 'hysterical'," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh became emotional when he denied the allegations of having sexually sacrificed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh became very emotionally affected, and from time to time he almost screamed and his voice stalled when he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee, saying the charges against him were a "gross and coordinated character murder" organized by liberals who were angry at Hillary Clinton's loss of the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she felt that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, because it showed that he was partial to the Democrats’ disadvantage.
“I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and the way he attacked the pair Clinton and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to bring Kavanaugh to court if he was elected, and whether the Democrats would get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I can say this – if he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he’s not just inappropriate to sit in the Supreme Court, but also to work in the court he’s in right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the Washington D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that she as a Democrat was concerned about what decisions Kavanaugh might make against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion case Roe vs. Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation questions, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would change on certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
It is not a situation for a hysterical and partial person to sit in court and expect us all to applaud," Pelosi said.
Women have to stand up.
It's a fair criticism, months and years of anger that's boiling over, and she can't get it out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do you?"
And she continued, "I got good help from a woman who was CEO somewhere. She said she also cried when she got angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying she said to the person she was talking to: 'You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she continued.
I thought it was bright.”
Tears are allowed to get out of anger in part because they are often misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories from one of my first jobs in a male-dominated office, where I once cried out of indescribable anger, was that I was taken in the collar of an older woman. It was a cool boss I had always been a little afraid of, and she dragged me into a staircase.
“Don’t let them see you cry,” she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you’re sorry and will be happy that they managed to push you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught up with an extramarital deal on a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the campaign, a very frustrated Schroeder felt that there was no reason not to investigate the idea of setting up for himself in the presidential election.
"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision," she said with a laugh to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates, the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone called it ‘Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs’.
Since she was late, she left with the fundraising, and made a promise not to enter as a candidate if she didn't get <0x24>2 million.
It was a project that was doomed to fail.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave <0x24>1,000 to men just gave her <0x24>250.
"Do they think I'll get a discount?" she asked.
When she announced in a speech that she was not going to start a formal presidential election campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions, gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration about the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters rather than delegates, and angered by sexism, that the vote stocked.
“You could have thought I had a nervous breakdown,” Schröder recalls about the reactions of the press.
“You could have thought that Kleenex was my company sponsor.
I remember thinking, ‘What are they going to write on my gravestone?’
"She's crying?"
Why the U.S.-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The opening streak in the U.S.-China trade war was ear-catching. The war is far from over, but the crack between the countries could benefit the Chinese government in the long run, according to experts.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by coating key Chinese export goods such as solar panels, steel and aluminum with tariffs.
The most significant escalation came this week, with new tariffs on goods worth <0x24>200 billion, which in practice means that half of all goods entering the United States from China are customs cleared.
Recently, fees of between five and ten percent on U.S. goods were dropped for <0x24>60 billion.
China has promised to match U.S. action, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to step down within a reasonable time.
Getting Washington back up means bending for demands, but publicly crawling for the United States would be too embarrassing for China’s President Xi Jinping.
However, experts believe that if Beijing plays its cards right, the US trade war press can provide positive support to China in the long run, by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
“A quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create conditions for economic panic in either country, and it is actually significantly more dangerous than viewers have previously wanted to acknowledge,” said Abigail Grace, research assistant at the Center for New American Security.
Syria ‘ready’ for returnees, according to foreign minister
Syria says it is ready to welcome voluntary return refugees and calls for help to build the country, which is in ruins after the more than seven years of war.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are now improving.
"The situation on the ground today is more stable and safe, thanks to our successes in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to build up the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists, in order to restore normality.
There are now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
An additional six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
According to Al-Moualem, the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that it does not receive conditional support or assistance from countries that have supported the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europa has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA with the final 16.5 vs 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won again when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn scored the 14.5 points required to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight hard during most of the tournament, got into the water at the end of the 16th hole pair 3-track, losing to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was the brightest in all rounds and became one of four players who have ever made 5-0-0 since the tournament’s current format was introduced in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth defeated 5 & 4 of the European team's lowest-ranked player, Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen from Denmark.
World's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 & 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who may have made his last Ryder Cup.
Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran with eight Ryder Cups behind him, became the most successful European ever with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I am so happy, so happy to win back the victory.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could be of help," one touched Garcia after the Europa League victory.
He left over the staff stick to his countryman John Ram who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in singles on Sunday.
"What an incredible pride, to be able to beat Tiger Woods. I grew up looking at him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France, and now has the score 13-21-3 for his Ryder Cup career.
A curious statistic for one of the world’s best players ever, who has won 14 major titles, which has only been surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all weekend to find a fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-class golf throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk said after the team's disappointing performance: "I'm proud of these guys they've fought.
It was this morning when we raised the temperature in Europe.
We took the blame.
Hat off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work on the US PGA tour and our Ryder Cup committee and we're going to move on.
I love these 12 guys and am proud to be the captain.
You have to bug and kick.
They played better than we did.”
Algae flowering: stops drop in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fisheries and Wildlife Commission shows a general reduction in algal bloom concentrations for parts of the area around Tampa Bay.
According to the Commission, uneven blooms are reported in the areas around the major municipalities of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier.
The algal bloom extends along more than 20 miles of the coast, from northern Pinellas to southern Lee.
Spots can be seen about a mile and a half out in the sea outside Hillsborough, but in fewer places than last week.
Algae blooming has also been observed in the municipality of Pasco.
Mean high concentrations in or off the coast of Pinellas have been reported during the past week. Outside of the Hillsborough coast low to high concentrations, background concentrations to high concentrations in Manatee, background concentrations to high concentrations in or off the coast of Sarasota.
Reports of respiratory irritation continue to come from the major municipalities of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
There were no reports of respiratory irritation in northwestern Florida last week.
