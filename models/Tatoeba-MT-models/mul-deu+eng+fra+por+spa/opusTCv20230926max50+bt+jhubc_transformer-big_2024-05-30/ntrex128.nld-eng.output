Members of the National Assembly of Wales worried they would be ‘compared to Muppets’
Members of the National Assembly of Wales are shocked by a proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament - Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal is a result of plans to change the current name ‘Welsh Assembly’ to ‘Welsh Parliament’.
Members of the National Assembly of various political parties are concerned that the new name will happen ridiculously.
A member of the National Assembly of Wales of the Labour Party said that MWP ‘receives on Twp and Pwp’.
For readers outside of Wales: twp is Welsh for crazy and pwp is Welsh for poop.
A member of the National Assembly of Wales of the Plaid Party said the group as a whole was “dissatisfied” and proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his party was “open” for the name change, but noted that the words MWP and Muppet are very similar.
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced as a short u.
The Welsh National Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to implement the name change, said: “Of course, it is the members of the National Assembly of Wales themselves who will make the final decision on their new title.”
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the members of the National Assembly of Wales the right to change the name of the Assembly.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed that most people felt that the National Assembly should be renamed to Parliament.
As for the title of the Members of the National Assembly, the Commission proposed ‘Welsh Parliament Members’ or WMPs, but the MWP option received the most support in public consultation.
Currently, the Members of the National Assembly would propose alternatives, but President Elin Jones will find it difficult to reach a consensus, and she will have to submit a bill on the changes in a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms also includes other amendments to the way the National Assembly works, including rules on the suspension of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly will be able to definitively vote on their new title when they debate the legislation.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing their country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday to change their country’s name to ‘Republic of North Macedonia’.
The popular referendum was organised in an attempt to resolve an incisive dispute with neighbouring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour means that the country would claim on its territory and has repeatedly objected to Macedonia’s requests to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the popular consultation on the name change, said he will not take into account the outcome of the referendum.
Proponents of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, however, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of Saint Martin's silence, those of Harlem have difficulty
“The older people I’ve talked to said there used to be a cafe and a church in every corner,” Adams said.
Today there is no cafe or church to be explored."
He said it was understandable that cafes had disappeared.
“People now have social contact in a different way,” he said.
‘Cafés are no longer the living room of the neighborhood, where people regularly walk through.’
However, he is concerned that the proceeds from the sale of the assets of the churches will last less than the leaders expect, “and sooner or later they will stand back at the beginning.”
Churches, he adds, could be replaced by apartment buildings with flats where the kind of people would live that will not help in the remaining refuges of the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who will buy flats in such buildings will be white,” he says, “which will lead to these churches being closed even faster, because it is unlikely that the people who move to these flats will become members of the church community.”
Both churches were once built by a white church community, before Harlem became a black metropolis: the metropolis community in 1870, Saint Martin's 10 years later.
The original church congregation of white Methodists left in the 1930s.
A black church from nearby took over the building.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black church led by Hon. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of shopkeepers on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, where blacks could rarely get a job or be promoted.
In 1939, the building was severely damaged by fire, but when the parishioners of Hon'ble Johnson planned to rebuild the church, they also bought a beech.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Reverend Johnson and his successor in Saint Martin's, proudly called the beard "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the bead in July referred in a different way to the instrument: ‘a cultural treasure’ and ‘an irreplaceable historical instrument’.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first beaver in the world ever played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger beaver of the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said Saint Martin's hadn't replaced him.
The events of the last months in Saint Martin's are a complicated story of architects and contractors, some hired by the church's lay leaders, others by the diocese.
The consistency (the governing body of the parish, consisting of lay leaders) wrote to the diocese in July to express its concern that the diocese would “want to recalculate the costs” to the consistency, although the consistency had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors who had the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency of the diocese.
Hai Injures 13-Year-Old Man Who Cracked Crab in California
On Saturday, on the first day of the crustacean season, a shark struck a 13-year-old boy who crashed into crustaceans in California.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon’s Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been chatting with friends about half an hour on Saturday when he heard the boy screaming for help, and along with a few others he pedaled to the boy to pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought the boy was screaming because he had caught a turtle, but then he realized ‘the boy was screaming: ‘I’ve been bitten!
I've been bitten!"
His key leg was completely open," Hammel saw as he approached the boy.
“I yelled that everyone had to get out of the water, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is reportedly in danger of dying.
It is not known which species of shark is responsible for the attack.
Beach guard captain Larry Giles told a news conference that a shark had been spotted in the vicinity a few weeks earlier, but that it had then been concluded that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim was seriously injured in the upper body.
Authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks living in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's wants to break through the British beauty market
Sainsbury’s competes with Boots, Superdrug, and Debenhams, and sets up beauty departments where specialist assistants work, such as in wholesale warehouses.
The initiative is part of a strategy to conquer the British beauty market, which is worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and continues to grow, while sales of fashion and household items continue to decline. The larger beauty departments are being tested in 11 stores across the country. If they are still more successful, they will still be successful.
The investment in the beauty market is also a result of the fact that supermarkets want to fill the shelves where televisions, microwaves and interior items once stood, with other products.
Sainsbury’s aims to double its beauty offering and offer 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also gets more space, with exhibition space per brand, such as in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also bringing its Boutique make-up back to the market, now that most products are suitable for vegans, something that younger shoppers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, perfumery the Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two stores at Sainsbury's. The first one opened earlier in Croydon, south of London, the second will open later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
As more and more people shop online and buy small amounts of food on a daily basis in local supermarkets, supermarkets need to make more effort to convince people to shop at them.
Mike Coupe, Chief Executive of Sainsbury’s, says that stores will look more and more like grocery stores, as the supermarket chain embraces it against discounts Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food.
Sainsbury’s has integrated Argos sales points in hundreds of stores and has also opened a number of Habitats since both chains were acquired two years ago. According to the company, food sales have increased and the acquisitions have yielded more returns.
The last time the supermarket tried to give its Beauty and Pharmacy departments a makeover, that became a flop.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership was terminated when a conflict arose over the distribution of the revenues from the pharmacy department in the supermarkets.
This is a new strategy since Sainsbury's have 281 pharmacy departments in stores three years ago for an amount of <0xC2><0xA3>125 million sold to Celesio, owner of the chain Lloyds Pharmacy.
Lloyds would also play a role in the plan, by adding an extensive range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury’s said: “We have completely changed the layout of our beauty department to make it more pleasant for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized training of our employees, who will be ready to give advice.
With our range of brands, we offer something for everyone, and thanks to the attractive environment and convenient locations, we make sure that our customers like to buy their beauty products from us, rather than shopping in the old way."
Peter Jones 'wounded' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Peter Jones, one of the stars of Dragons Den, is 'furyed' because TV presenter Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle company. She wants to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for True, their brand for homewear and accessories.
The company of Jones and Willoughby is sometimes compared to the brand Goop by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Peter Jones of Dragons Den is angry at Holly Willoughby because at the last moment she has withdrawn from their profitable lifestyle business to focus on her contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was “wrathful” when Willoughby on Tuesday during a difficult meeting at the company’s headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire announced that her new contracts (valued at <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million) would not allow her enough time for True, their homewear and accessories brand.
The company is compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby's fortune by an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When the 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she would leave True, Jones left for one of his vacation homes abroad.
A source said, “Truly was one of Holly’s top priorities.
It would secure her future in the long run, and provide enough for the next decades.
Everyone was shocked when she decided to retire.
No one could believe his ears last Tuesday, because the launch was planned soon.
The warehouse of the headquarters in Marlow is full of products ready for sale."
Experts believe that leaving the presenter, one of Britain’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions, as a result of large investments in products from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear, and because the launch could now cause further delays.
And that could mean the end of years of friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, who have three children, have been good friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truely in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, became President of the company in March.
The two couples often go on holiday together and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin’s television production company.
Willoughby will soon become M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of the I'm A Celebrity program on British broadcaster ITV.
A source from Jones' surroundings said last night, "We have no comments on his business affairs."
Hard language “and then there was love between us”
He joked about the criticism he would receive in the media about a remark he made that some people would find “inappropriate for a president,” and about his positive view of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump imitated a news anchor when he said:
“I didn’t give up anything.”
Trump described their first meeting in June in Singapore as a major step towards the dismantling of nuclear weapons in North Korea, adding that Kim is interested in a second meeting.
But the negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons are over.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told leaders of the UN General Assembly that North Korea saw no “similar reaction” by the United States after North Korea’s first disarmament initiatives.
Meanwhile, the United States is continuing its sanctions to keep pressure on the boiler, he says.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech during the rally.
“We are doing very well in North Korea,” he said.
“We were close to a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim have led to positive results. The missile tests have ended, hostages have been released and the material surpluses of US military have returned to their own country.
He also defended his unusual approach to his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to behave like a president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to access this crowded arena, there would be about 200 people standing here,” Trump said.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroys island, killing hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok no longer had a home, no national disaster was announced, which is a requirement for the launch of international aid.
“In many cases, unfortunately, it is clear that they do not seek international help, which is difficult for us,” Sumbung said.
Save the Children is setting up a team to travel to Palu, but it is not certain whether the help providers from abroad will be able to work on the spot.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Aid Agency, said Indonesian officials were still evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international organizations would be given permission to help.
Although Indonesia is constantly plagued by earthquakes, the country is still particularly poorly prepared for the anger of nature.
In Aceh, shelters were built to hide from tsunamis, but along other coasts you rarely see them.
The fact that there were no tsunami warnings in Palu, even though it was a warning of force, has probably contributed to the number of deaths.
Even in ideal conditions, it can be difficult to travel from one Indonesian island to another.
National disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days for the ship to reach the site of the disaster.
Improving Indonesia’s homeless infrastructure was one of the core points of President Joko Widodo’s campaign, and he has already spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But President Joko’s government is facing a shortage of funding, and he hopes to be re-elected next year.
President Joko is also under pressure from ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority today follow a rather conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to leave their homes because Christian and Islamic gangs fought on the streets, with machetes, arrows and bows and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool takes an impressive match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge defended Liverpool last Saturday against Chelsea in the Premier League, with a goal in the 89th minute, during a game at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge was given a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he stood at a distance of about 30 metres from Chelsea's goal, at the time his team was behind by 1-0.
He hit left against the ball and then shot in the direction of the farthest pole.
The ball flew high above the penalty area, in the direction of the upper right corner of the net.
He unleashed the leap of Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
“It was very difficult to reach that position, to reach the ball, and players like Shaq always play as much forward as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante approaching and I dared a try. I didn’t really think about it, I just jumped on the ball.”
Chelsea stood at rest 1-0, after a goal from Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues tip kicked the ball with his heel to Mateo Kovacic, after which he hurried through the midfield to the Liverpool half.
Kovacic made a quick one-tweet on the civil society.
He then gave a nice pass, allowing Hazard to reach the penalty area.
Hazard was faster than the defense and kicked the ball with his left foot past Liverpool's Alisson Becker in the net, next to the rear pole.
Liverpool will play Wednesday at 15:00 in the group stage of the Champions League against Naples, at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will take on Thursday at 3:00 p.m. in London against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia reaches 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the national disaster relief agency said Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped in the wreckage of buildings that had collapsed as a result of the 7.5-strong earthquake on Friday, which also caused waves of 6 m high, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, where more than 380,000 people live, is full of ruined buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman was stabbed to death
This morning, the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, and a murder investigation was opened.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 p.m. in Grayson Mews in John Street, the body showed stab wounds and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking locals to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Police Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation has just begun, but I want anyone who has seen or heard anything suspicious about being near John Street in Birkenhead to contact us.
I also want to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, to contact us if they may have filmed something via a dashcam, because they can have information that is essential for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman on the spot came to ask questions about the place where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have confirmed that they are currently notifying the victim’s family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has tried to enter his apartment, but was told by police that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
The residents are now told that it will take hours before they can return home.
A policeman would have told someone that the area is being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared crying on the spot.
She keeps repeating, “What a terrible thing!”
At 2:00 p.m., two police cars were in the deposition and a third were just outside.
During the deposition, a number of officers monitored the apartment building.
Anyone who has information is asked to send a message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, stating log 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's statue at British Parliament is the latest victim of 'rewriting history'
The banning of the statue would be a poetic justice for the Taliban's destruction of the many cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatic Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick’s suggestion as “dwaas” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable that the current debate on the removal of statues would lead to the fishing of Oliver Cromwell’s figure just outside the Houses of Parliament.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither commanded nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his forefather Thomas in the last century.
The beautiful image of Cromwell, created by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, testifies to the opinion that prevailed in the 19th century and is part of the story of a figure that many believe is still to be recognized.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely correct idea is still being debated.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure representing one side of that gap.
His achievements as Lord Protector must also be recognized and remembered."
Pig Killer Kills Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, whose surname 'Yuan' is only known, was found dead at a stall in Liupanshui market in Guizhou province. His artery was boarded and he was under the blood, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares for the vaccination of pigs at a pig farm, on 30 May 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He was reportedly on Wednesday with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and found a door open to a neighboring pig barn.
According to the cousin, a large male pig with blood on his belly was in the pig shovel.
A forensic study found that the 250 kg pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were bleed and stained,” the cousin with the nickname ‘Wu’ said, according to Guiyang Evening News.
Images of surveillance cameras show that Yuan arrived on Thursday at 4.40 p.m. on the market to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not Yuan or his cousin.
A market official told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent the other from attacking, while the police collected evidence on the spot.
According to reports, Yuan’s family and market authorities are currently negotiating compensation for his death.
It rarely happens, but there have been cases of pigs attacking people before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously wounding the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300 kg pig pushed a farmer from Wales against his tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
When a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba at CBC News testified that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood aggression can trigger.
“They’re just playful.
They're just kids, very curious... they're not ready to hurt people.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect,” he said.
Hurricane Rosa's tail brings heavy rain to the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa has weakened since it has reached the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
Rosa, however, will bring heavy rains to the north and southwest of Mexico in the coming days.
At a wind speed of 135 km per hour, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane at 5am on Sunday morning and was 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move to the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a troop begins to form over the Pacific Ocean, which moves east towards the western coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, tropical humidity is pushed northward, to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring 10 centimeters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture that reacts with the approaching slope will cause widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest in the coming days.
Locally, 2 to 10 cm of rain will cause dangerous flooding, debris streams and possibly landslides in the desert.
Tropical humidity will lead to precipitation of 5 to 8 cm per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to rain 5 to 10 cm in parts of the southwest, especially above most of Arizona.
There are sudden flooding possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions, as the tropical rains can be very widespread.
It is strongly advised to enter the desert on foot when tropical rainfall threatens.
Heavy rainfall can surround ravines in deserted rivers, and weather will produce local windstorms and dust.
The approaching slope locally brings some heavy rain to parts of the southern California coastline.
There is a possibility of rain of 1.5 cm, which could lead to small streams of rubbish and smooth roads.
This would be the first rainfall in the region during the rainy season.
Distributed tropical rains will approach Arizona on Sunday night to Monday morning, after which the rains will spread more late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread across the Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
In October, temperatures in the U.S. may fluctuate greatly, as the North Pole gets cooler, but the tropics remain quite warm.
This sometimes leads to large temperature differences over short distances.
There is a beautiful example of impressive temperature differences in the middle of the U.S. on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is almost 20 degrees.
In the coming days, the ongoing summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
In much of the central and eastern U.S., October is expected to start warm, with temperatures everywhere swinging around 30<0xC2><0xB0>C, from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
In New York it can be 27 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees warmer than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows that until mid-October the odds are high at above-average temperatures in the eastern United States.
More than 20 million people watched the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people watched one of the six television networks on Thursday the engaging testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, a U.S. Supreme Court candidate, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of an alleged assault in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, as broadcasters interrupted the regular programming for Friday's surprise: an agreement arranged by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to investigate the charge for a week.
Ford told the Senate Justice Commission that she was 100 percent sure that a drunken Kavanaugh beat her and tried to pull off her clothes during a high school party.
Kavanaugh stated in a cited testimony that he was 100 percent sure that this had not happened.
More than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen have probably looked at Friday.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no figures immediately available for the other networks that broadcast the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people looking at an office.
For comparison, that’s about like a play-off of a football match or the Oscars.
The Fox News Channel, which supports Kavanaugh's nomination, had the most viewers on the day of the hearing: an average of 5.69 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
ABC followed with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, MSNBC had 2.89 million viewers and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
Even after the hearing, the public remained very interested.
Flake was the central figure of the events on Friday.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he would support Kavanaugh with his voice, the CNN and CBS cameras recorded on Friday morning that protesters were screaming at him as he tried to take the elevator to a hearing of the Justice Commission.
He stayed for a few minutes with his eyes closed while he was scammed, live on CNN.
“I’m right here in front of you,” said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the people the truth?
Someone shouted, “You have power, while so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and just before the elevator closed, he added that he would say more during the hearing.
The various broadcasters broadcast everything live when the judicial committee had to vote hours later on the appointment of Kavanaugh to the Senate.
But Flake said he would only vote in favour with the sense that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee against next week, something that the Democrats of the minority insist on.
Flake was convinced by his friend Chris Coons, a senator and a Democrat.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with Coons and several senators.
Flakes' choice was important because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'political game' around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians who were critical of her plans to leave the European Union of “a political game” with Britain’s future and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, on the same front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stressed his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit. He said that her proposal that Britain and the EU should tax each other was ‘absurd’.
Wayde Sims shooter: police arrest Dyteon Simpson as suspect of the death of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect for the shooting in which Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU, was shot dead.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and is in prison on suspicion of murder, Baton Rouge police said.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said the Sims lost their glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the crime scene and found Simpson’s DNA on the glasses, reports WAFB, a CBS television station.
The police questioned Simpson and later declared that he had known that he had shot Wayde with the result of his death.
His deposit is set at <0x24>350,000, the Advocate reports.
East Baton Rouge's lawyer has published a preliminary report on Friday stating that the cause of death is a gunshot wound in the neck.
The report states that the Fugitive Task Force of the Louisiana State Police, the state police crime lab, the Southern University police and local residents have all contributed to the investigation that led to an arrest.
Sports Director Joe Alleva of LSU thanked the local police for his “dedication and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
He was 198 cm tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was 'kapot' and 'in shock' dead by Waydes.
“This is an event that you always hope will never happen,” Wade says.
Volcano sweeps like on Mexico City
The ashes ejected by the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern quarters of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans last Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater was picked up and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded over a 24-hour period.
The center has detected vibrations and vibrations several times.
On social media, photos of a thin layer of axes appeared on motorways in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, the first time since September 2017, when an earthquake with a force of 7.1 on the Richter scale hit central Mexico.
The volcano, called Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the eve of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence activists hit the riot police, while thousands took part in rival demonstrations on the occasion of the first anniversary of the Catalan independence vote that divided the region into two groups.
A group of masked pro-separatists detained by the riot police shielded the agents with eggs and powder paint, creating dark dust clouds in the streets that are usually filled with tourists.
Later that day, screenshots broke out with the police, and the police pulled their bump up to stop the fighting.
For more than an hour, pro-independence groups sang ‘Don’t forget, don’t forgive’, while their opponents shouted ‘Long live Spain’.
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries they sustained during the protests, the local press reported.
Tensions continue to rise in the independent region, one year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid considers illegal, but is celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The voters overwhelmingly expressed their desire to become independent, although the rise was low and the people who were against separation boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote in the polling stations in the region, which resulted in violent screenshots.
Pro-independence groups had camped on the spot on Friday night on Saturday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but one was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful about Catalonia’s prospects of becoming independent.
“Last year we experienced one of our most beautiful moments.
I saw my parents cry out of joy because they could vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Although the Catalan pro-independence parties achieved an essential victory in the regional elections in December, even if that was the case, this year it was difficult for them to build on their success. Many of their best-known leaders are, after all, absent, either in their right of deportation, or in their right of deportation.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mounter who filmed the protest in support of the police on his phone, said the conflict had been sparked by politicians on both sides.
“The tensions are getting higher,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in custody since late last year, declared that he will take part in next year's European Parliament elections.
“A candidacy for the European elections is the best way to complain about the decline in democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Man Arrested After House Was Cracked By Car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place on Thursday around 7:30 p.m. local time in Ballynagard Crescent.
Police Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building themselves had been damaged.
A crossbow may have been fired on the car at some point.
Livingston wins 1-0 against the Rangers thanks to goal of Menga
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured them victory
The promoted Livingston surprised the Rangers and secured Steven Gerrard his second defeat in a series of 18 games since he was manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference and Gary Holt's team came to equal height with Hibernian.
The Gerrards team failed this season to win an out-match during the Premiership. They have to take it Sunday against leader Hearts, who scored eight points on them.
But first, the Rangers will receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europa League.
Livingston has won six consecutive games in his division, and coach Holt hasn't suffered a single defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against strong visitors
Holt’s team had long been able to achieve a lead for the first goal, since their direct way of playing caused all sorts of problems with the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but failed to finish it with a goal. Then Alan Lithgow, who picked up Craig Halkett's headball, kicked the ball above the goal.
The home team allowed the Rangers to play with great pleasure, and awaited his chances calmly and confidently.
And that eventually led to the crucial goal.
The Rangers allowed a free staircase and Livingston provided an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to create an opportunity for Menga, who scored from the penal area.
At the time, the Rangers had been ball possession for a long time, but the defense of the home team was indestructible and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had not yet had much to do.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos made sure Kelly had to avoid a goal.
Scott Pittman kicked the ball at the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow lost the goal after a move from his colleagues from Livingston.
They continued to reach the penalty area of Livingston, but they were relegated each time. Two penalties were refused, one after Halkett's attack on invader Glenn Middleton and one for handball.
'Fenomenal' by Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They played excellently without exception and continue to exceed expectations in their race to the top.
Their style of play and the composition of their team has barely changed since their return to the highest regions, but especially Holt deserves much recognition for the way he has sucked up the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Leader Halkett was fantastic, with an excellent organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall walked on top of their toes throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, did not know how to break.
Although they have often played very well under Gerrard, this time they did not reach their usual level.
Their final phase wasn’t good enough (they only managed to smash the home team once) and the Rangers will now realize that they need to play better, because they’re somewhere in the middle of the rankings.
Erdogan is greeted with mixed feelings in Cologne
Under a glowing blue sky and with a wide smile, the leaders of Turkey and Germany went to breakfast together in Berlin on Saturday (September 29).
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which is aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They disagree on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then left for Cologne for the opening of a giant new mosque.
Cologne is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police resorted to security reasons when they recruited the crowd of 25,000 people to gather for the mosque, but many sympathizers came near to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters, many of them Kurds, also heard their voices, condemning both Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The rival protests reflect the division over a visitor praised by some German Turks as a hero and accused by others of being an autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after collision with car
In London, a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, at about 10:15 local time.
The driver of the car stopped and the ambulance staff was present, but the man died on the spot.
A few months ago, another cyclist died in an accident with a plane crash on Childers Street, about a mile and a half from Saturday’s accident.
The Metropolitan Police said police were working on identifying the man and his closest family will be notified.
The road is closed in several places, buses are rerouted and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Ciphers Injured in Order Disorder
Six ciphers have been injured in a violation of order in a heavily secured prison for men, according to the prison office.
The riots broke out on Sunday at about 9.30 local time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and are still underway.
Specialised ‘Tornado’ chips are used to solve a situation in which eight prisoners are involved in one department.
The ciphers were treated there for light injuries to the face.
A spokesman for the Prison Service said: “Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed for a current incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and the responsible are at least referred to the police and may have to stay behind the scenes for longer.”
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison was treated in the hospital after he was attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the riot police were called to prison for a serious order disturbance in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (with potentially positive effects on drought areas)
It is rare that a tropical depression reaches Arizona, but that is exactly what is likely to happen at the beginning of next week, because the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa moves across the southwest of the desert area, bringing risks of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of sudden flooding for the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, and the southeast of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to be hanging on Tuesday just above Phoenix. Monday night it will be raining.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression in the 200-mile area of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation, with isolated amounts up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other parts of the southwest of the desert area, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to get 3 to 5 cm of rain, and 10 cm is possible here and there.
For areas that are not at risk of flooding, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is very worrying, part of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial because the southwest is currently experiencing a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, the map showing current drought areas, slightly more than 40 percent of Arizona suffers at least extreme drought, the second-highest in its category.
The route of Hurricane Rosa reaches the mainland via the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa is still on hurricane strength on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 140 km per hour, located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at a speed of 20 km per hour.
The storm hits cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean, weakening them.
Therefore, it is expected to arrive on Monday afternoon or evening with the power of a tropical storm in Mexico.
There may be heavy rainfall in parts of Mexico, which involves a significant risk of flooding.
“A total of 8 to 15 cm of precipitation is expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with up to 25 cm possible,” weather.com reported.
Rosa moves north across Mexico like a tropical storm before she reaches the Arizona border early in the morning as a tropical depression, which will then take place on Tuesday night through Arizona and south of Utah.
“The greatest danger expected from Rosa or her tail is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest of Sonora, and southwest of the desert,” the National Hurricane Center said.
This rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden flooding and debris in the deserts and landslides on mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four arrests on suspicion of attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old with stitch wounds was found in Somerset.
The teenager was found wounded at around 4am local time in the Excelsior Terrace district in Midsummer Norton on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition was “stable.”
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstock area, according to police from Avon and Somerset.
The police are asking anyone who might have filmed something about what happened to report.
Trump says Kavanaugh "has suffered under the commonwealth, the rage" of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and scandalous Democratic Party tactics," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh during his nomination process continuously "has suffered under the commonwealth, the rage" of the Democratic Party
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday and strongly and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford’s allegation that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about her allegations.
The president said on Saturday that “the American people saw the magnificent and incredible character, quality and courage” of Kavanaugh that day.
“A voice to recognize Judge Kavanaugh is a voice that recognizes one of the most complete legal opinions of our time, a lawyer with an excellent state of service,” he told the crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke of the importance of the Republican rise in the midterm elections.
“In five weeks, one of the most important elections in our lives will take place.
I don’t take part, but I actually take part,” he said.
“That’s why I stand everywhere for great candidates.”
Trump stated that the Democrats are on a mission to "resist and hinder us".
The first major procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh’s appointment is expected to take place by Friday, a senior GOP leader told CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, and tariffs are increasing
A major earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi killed at least 384 people, sweeping many of the ground when giant waves crashed on the beach, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday for a beach festival in the city of Palu, when waves up to six meters high hit the ground at the time it began to blur. Many people fell to the ground and the waves destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami was the result of an earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
‘When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, there were still people on the beach, they didn’t walk away immediately and became the victim of the tsunami,’ said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia’s Natural Disaster Aid Agency BNPB during a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami also led to other dangers: he dragged cars, tree trunks, houses, he touched everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had travelled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coastline.
Some people climbed a tree to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photos released by the Natural Disaster Aid Bureau show that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges have been ruined and collapsed, and a mosque is surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was shaken by the aftershocks.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the massive earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb that had fallen on Hiroshima during World War II.
It is possible that the geography of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, has increased the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
Some of the dead were trapped under the debris of demolished buildings, he said, injuring about 540 people and missing 29.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and damage could be even greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
“The communication with Donggala is completely flat, we have absolutely no information,” Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross said in a statement. The Red Cross staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, but it can get much worse,” the Red Cross said.
The organization received a lot of criticism on Saturday for not saying that a tsunami had hit Palu, although employees said the waves had reached the country within the time the warning was given.
In amateur images shared on social media, one can hear a man on the top floor of a building screaming in panic at people down the street to warn them that a tsunami is coming.
Minutes later, a wall of water sinks onto the coast and buildings and cars are smashed.
Reuters was unable to verify the images immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cuts communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army is currently dispatching cargo aircraft with auxiliary goods from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the evacuees still urgently need food and other basic needs.
The city’s airport is reopened for relief only and will remain closed to the public until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Tsunami death toll rises above 800.
It's very bad.
World Vision employees from Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where workers in the courtyard of their office sought shelter in tents of cover sail, but passed along tables of devastation, Doseba said.
“They told me they saw many houses that were destroyed,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even when aid groups began the difficult assignment to initiate emergency aid, some complained that certain foreign aid providers with great expertise could not travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian legislation, financing, goods and staff from abroad can only be allowed if the location of a disaster is declared a national natural disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, ‘OK, this is a national disaster,’ we can provide international assistance, but that status has not yet been declared.”
When the second night after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday fell on Palu, friends and family of the missing continued to hope that they would find their loved ones back, as in the miracles that people so much like to hear from horrific natural disasters like this.
On Saturday, a boy was taken out of a sewer.
On Sunday, aid workers released a woman who had been trapped two days under the rubble with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which had taken place earlier this month in Indonesia.
His students were also stuck in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi.
“As a veteran in the paragliding world, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon said the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed had spread to the paragliding community and that in the hours following, he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the athletes in Palu, who participated in the beach festival.
However, in his messages, only one gray dot appeared instead of two blue dots.
“I think that means the messages have not been delivered,” he said.
Thieves steal <0x24>26,750 while supplying ATM in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, steel thieves stole <0x24>26,750 from a Brink employee who was filling a cash machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from Newport police.
The driver had just looted a cash machine in the entertainment complex and wanted to fill it with money, Inspector Dennis McCarthy wrote in the message.
While he was busy, another man ran from behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money that was ready to deliver.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing, according to the press release, but the police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
If you have any information about the identity of the perpetrators, please contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Last Saturday, he announced the change on Twitter with the words: “The creature that is formally known as Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West has been called Ye for a while and used this nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The name change was announced in the run-up to his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her performance during the show for “emotional reasons,” the show’s creator said.
Ye is not only an abbreviation of his current artist name, but West said earlier that the word had a religious meaning for him.
I think ‘ye’ is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year, when he told radio presenter Big Boy about the title of his album.
“So I am you, I am us, we are it.
I’ve moved from Kanye, which means ‘the only one’, to simply Ye, a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are.”
He's not the only famous rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who previously worked with West, has also worked with and without the coupling and the main letters.
Mexican President Promises Not to Use Armed Forces Against Citizens
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the elected president of Mexico, has promised never to use military power against civilians, the country is on the eve of the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would “never use military violence to suppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, military forces fired at a peaceful demonstration on the square, killing up to 300 people, during which time left-wing student movements emerged throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to help young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He said young people often become members of criminal gangs due to unemployment and a lack of opportunities to study.
U.S. needs to double A.I. funding
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States must double the amount it spends on AI research, says investor and AI specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who has already worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He says this following the announcements of AI coming from different departments of the U.S. government, despite the fact that the U.S. does not have a formal strategy for AI.
In the meantime, China announced its plan last year: it wants to be the number one in terms of AI innovations by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for AI research would already be a good start, given the fact that all other countries are so far behind the US, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
A doubling of funding could lead to a doubling of the chances that the next major AI achievement will take place in the U.S., Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order’ was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face<0x2B><0x2B>, one of China’s leading AI companies.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an A.I. system that defeated the best player of American Othello, and later he was manager at Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese department of Google.
Lee expressed his appreciation for technology competitions organised by the U.S. government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next competition would take place, as it would help to discover the next visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers often have to work hard to get government subsidies, Lee said.
“China doesn’t get our best academics, the companies do,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited the best powers of universities in recent years to work on AI.
Lee said U.S. efforts at the A.I. level would also benefit from a change in immigration policy.
“Anyone who is a doctor at the A.I. level should automatically be offered a green card,” he said.
The Chinese National Council released its next-generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The Chinese Foundation for Natural Sciences provides financial support to employees of academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations donate money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to involve industry and academic partners in the initiative, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that <0x24>2 billion would be invested in the AI Next initiative.
The NSF is currently investing more than <0x24>100 million in research into AI.
However, the U.S. legislation that should lead to the establishment of a national security commission for artificial intelligence has been in the forefront for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on possible name change of their country
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum on the possible change of their country's name to 'Republic of North Macedonia', which would resolve a dispute with Greece that has been going on for decades and would no longer be Greece's Macedonian application for membership of the European Union.
Greece has a province also called Macedonia, and says that the name of its northern neighbor means that the country claims on Greek territory. As a result, Greece vetoed Macedonia's accession to the European Union and NATO.
The two governments signed an agreement on the basis of the proposed new name in June, but nationalists believe that the name change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he will not vote in the referendum and through a boycott campaign, it is not certain that the required rise of at least 50 percent will be achieved, which may therefore render the referendum invalid.
The question on the ballot was formulated as follows: ‘Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership by accepting the agreement with Greece?’
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the price to be paid is worth trying to become a member of institutions such as the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that emerged when the former Yugoslavia split.
“I come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because that will lead to a safer life for all of us,” said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, enough MEPs have indicated that they will respect the outcome, which will determine it.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The National Election Commission said there had been no reports of irregularities at 13:00.
However, the rise was only 16 percent at the time, compared to 34 percent in the previous 2016 parliamentary elections, when 66 percent of registered voters came to vote.
“I come to vote because it is important for my children. Our place is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and son Dusko voted on September 30, 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, during the referendum on the name change of the country that would pave the way for NATO and the European Union membership.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage and set up chairs for tents set up by people who boycotted the referendum.
“We are a supporter of NATO and the EU, but we want to participate as a full member, not through a backdoor,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of the European-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev says membership of NATO will bring about breadful investments for Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I am convinced that the overwhelming majority is in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said.
He said a “yes” as a result would be “a confirmation of our future.”
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research found that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, less than the required rise.
Another survey, conducted by hot Macedonian TV station Telma TV, concluded that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent would vote yes.
If the referendum is successful, the rise must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policy since it came to power in May last year.
Manchester City's Sergio Aguero passes full defense of Brighton and scores
Last Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made a short break with Brighton's defense at the Etihad Stadium in England's Manchester City, where Manchester City won the game by 2-0.
It looked like a flute of a cent, how Aguero scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine spike first got the ball played on the midfielder.
He raced between three Brighton defenders through, right into the open field.
There Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He knew how to pass a defender and was too fast for some others on the edge of the Brighton Penalty Area.
Then he gave a pass to the left, where Sterling waited.
The English attacker used his first action in the penalty area to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right shoe to defeat goaltender Mathew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the net.
“Aguero has problems with his feet,” Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola told the press.
“We decided to let him play for 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the first advantage in the Premier League.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball when he was standing deep in Brighton's playground.
He sent a beautiful pass along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane held the ball for a moment and then sent Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky Blues player just hit the ball before he was too far away.
City will face Hoffenheim on Tuesday at 12.55 pm in the Champions League group stage. The match will take place in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in German Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to play and it doesn't make the Rockies easy to reach the play-off
Now that the Washington Nationals have been eliminated for the play-off, there wasn’t much reason to force a new start.
Still, the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to play against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are consequences for the Rockies' participation in the play-off. They are currently one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have empowered at least one wildcard for the play-off thanks to their 5-2 win against the Nationals last Friday, but now want to do everything in their power to secure their first division title.
"While there's nothing left for us, at least we can pitch with the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver will be optimal with this audience and the other team is probably playing at the highest level that I would meet this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to be involved in that?”
The Nationals still have to announce who will be on Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to set Scherzer up as a pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, was on Thursday in the field and would pitch the following Sunday, although that is normal his rest day.
Washington's right-handed pitcher is at 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump to hold a meeting in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court, while speaking about the importance of the Republican rise in the midterm elections.
“Everything we have already achieved is at stake in November.
In five weeks, one of the most important elections in our lives will take place.
This is one of the really big elections. I don't participate, but I actually do. That's why I come up everywhere for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “We see a terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, we see it happening now.
And they are determined to take power back, no matter what they have to do for it. You see the community, the awkwardness.
It doesn’t matter to them who they hurt, who they have to push away to get power and control. That’s what they want: power and control, but that’s not what we’re going to give them.”
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "resist and hinder us".
“And we’ve seen that in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “boos and common and false and lying.”
He mentioned the name of Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who sits in the Senate Commission for Justice, which led to loud calls from the public.
“Do you remember what she answered?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for one... that was really a bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a broad church.
The party is intolerant to people who say what they think
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, that was no surprise.
After all, I am the latest in a whole series of Labour Members to get that we are not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was punished with the motion for censorship because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically, issues similar to these, in which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
In the announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday, it was stated: “We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
And that was also the case during most GC meetings on Friday night during the eight years that I was already a local Labour MP.
Unfortunately, that is not the tone of many meetings today and has long forgotten the promise of a ‘more kind, softer’ policy, if it had ever started.
It is becoming increasingly clear that a divergent opinion is not tolerated in the Labour Party and any opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, and colleagues who, as far as I knew, had a similar political view as I did, suddenly expected me to reverse and take a position that I would never otherwise have agreed to, from topics such as national security to the European single market.
Every time I speak for an audience, whatever I say, there are social media scandals that call for me to reject my nomination as a member of parliament for the next elections, highlighting the politics of the centre and telling me that I should not be a member of Labour.
And that's all I'm going through.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments to my address are generally political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who deal with a flood of sexist or racist reactions every day, but do not let themselves be intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is that severe shelling parties are apparently considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every ‘motion of distrust’ or change of selection rules, the party becomes smaller.
I have often been advised over the past two years to keep me up, not just to express my opinion loudly, and then I would ‘not get into trouble’.
But that's why I didn't go into politics.
Since I became a member of Labour 32 years ago as a schoolchild, provoked by the neglect of Thatcher’s government that literally caused my classroom to collapse, I have always advocated better public services for those who need them most, both in my role as a councillor and in my role as a minister.
I have never concealed my politics, even in the last election.
Everyone in Nottingham East had clarity about my policy positions and my conflicts with the current leadership.
To those who have propagated the motion on Friday, I can only say one thing: when the country is heading for a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But in fact, I have only one message, which is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that threats to reject my candidacy as a Member of Parliament for the next elections, or political opportunities will not stop me from taking action.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: unbeaten Ayr on the way to the top
Two late attempts may have squeezed the final result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr is rightly triumphing in this delightful game of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
They are now at the top of the rankings, the only undefeated team of the ten.
In the end, it was both their superior defense and their better chances that gave the home team the victory, and coach Peter Murchie was allowed to be satisfied.
"We've had a hard time in our games so far and we're still unbeaten, so I'm a happy man," he said.
Robyn Christie van Melrose: “All the honor to Ayr, they have taken better advantage of their chances than we have.”
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, completed by Frazier Climo, led to a lead for Ayr, but by a yellow card from Rory Hughes of the Scottish national team (which he got during the Warriors match) could let Melrose speak the numbers and Jason Baggot defeated him.
Climo secured an extra lead for Ayr with a penalty and scored a conversion after a solotry just before the rest. For example, it was 17-5 for Ayr after the first half.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, followed by a conversion of Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
The match was long paused for a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, which was carried out on a white card, and once the match was re-started, Ayr was able to proceed with a try of Stafford McDowall followed by a conversion of Climo.
Then lead Blair Macpherson was given a yellow card from Ayr, and again Melrose scored off with the extra man when no conversion followed on a try by Bruce Colvine at the end of a match where the pressure was very high.
However, the home team returned, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he tacked Climo without the ball, MacPherson made a touchdown at the penalty line-out behind the rising Ayr mouse.
Climo took care of the conversion, and did so almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's box kick and halfback Gregor Henry sent off for the home team's fifth try.
Star of Still Game is ready for a new career in the restaurant world
It looks like Actor Ford Kieran from Still Game is going to the catering business, apparently he has been appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and in which he acts himself with his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last in the series, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official data, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the story, but a source from the Scottish Sun revealed that Kiernan was looking for a way to participate in the ‘flowering restaurant business’ in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': the country-imprisoned Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific Ocean
Marines patrol in a tug-of-war marine office in La Paz.
In public buildings, an ocean blue flag is waving.
On all naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the motto is: “The sea is ours.
It’s a duty to win them back.”
Throughout Bolivia surrounded by country, the memory of the coastline that the country had to give up on Chile after a bloody 19th-century raw materials conflict is still alive, just like the desire to revive the Pacific Ocean.
That hope may have reached its highest point in recent decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a judgment of the International Court of Justice, which should fall on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course looks forward to the outcome with a positive outlook,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians across the country will look at the Court's ruling on large screens, hoping that the Hague court will plead in favor of Bolivia that Chile, after decades of fierce talks, is obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the sea.
Also for Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, who stands for a controversial fight for re-election next year, is much at stake with Monday’s ruling.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he swore at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will probably not decide in favor of Bolivia, and even if it did, little would change.
The United Nations body established in the Netherlands does not have the authority to assign the Chilean territory and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
That the International Court of Justice’s ruling falls just six months after the final hearing indicates that the case was “not complicated,” says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And the outlook for a positive result from Bolivia has certainly not improved, on the contrary, the situation has perhaps even worsened in the last four years.
“The issue of access to the sea has been seized by the current Bolivian government,” Zarate said.
Morales’ war-like rhetoric has all the goodwill that Chile may have completely undermined, she claimed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their talks at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to continue to talk afterwards.
Since 1962, the two countries have no ambassadors in each other’s countries.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltsé, who represents Bolivia in The Hague, denies that the court’s decision has been taken unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of international relations with Chile" and "an opportunity to end 139 years of disagreements, with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, uses the maritime issue as a political cradle.
"Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific," he added.
“The verdict is an opportunity to show that we have to leave the past behind us.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never remove its nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
Mr Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to comply with the promises made during a summit between the leaders of the rivals in Singapore.
He said this at the time that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears on the verge of restarting nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the summit in Singapore with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a "utopia" that the permanent sanctions and the U.S. objection to a declaration ending the Korean war will one day get North Korea on its knees.
Washington is not inclined to agree with the statement without Pyongyang taking important steps in the field of disarmament first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But skepticism prevails and there is doubt that Pyongyang is serious if he says he would abandon an arsenal that the country probably sees as his only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest collection of huge head covers, for sale soon near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or keep the sun out of your eyes, do not look further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a series of crazy oversized headrests for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, a highlight during Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats were not far from Instagram this summer and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations on the catwalk.
The striking piece of Valentino was a gigantic beige hat decorated with a four-width wide edge, hanging over the models' eyes.
Other oversized accessories were watermelons occupied with gems, a wizard hat and even an anise, but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
In many of the colorful masks, the lips were sewn tightly, resembling Hannibal Lecter rather than high-couture.
One creation looked like diving equipment, complete with snorkeling and glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream.
And if you want to follow this bold fashion, you are lucky.
Style watchers predict that the huge hats will find their way to the clothing stores near you.
The gigantic hats may have been inspired by 'La Bomba', the shovel hat with a two-meter wide edge that everyone wears, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very impractical hat that appeared everywhere on social media also provided another great creation on the catwalk: a slippery beach bag that was almost as big as the model in swimsuit that the bag wore.
The reddish raffia bag, decorated with raffia fringes and finished with a white leather pendant, was the most striking piece in the La Riviera SS19 collection by Jacquemus during Paris Fashion Week.
The famous designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see large hats and beach bags in stores next summer. Since the designer has made such a huge impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for extra large accessories.'
John Edward: Language Skills Essential to World Citizens
The independent schools in Scotland have an excellent state of service in the field of academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with again an excellent series of exam results, as well as individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other initiatives across the community.
With more than 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further and higher education, the career they choose and their place as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made school curriculum, we see that modern languages are popular and desired subjects remain excellent within schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “When you talk to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
When you talk to him in his own language, you reach his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s recent exam results we can deduce that languages are at the top of the ranking, with the highest success rates within independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages achieved a high score.
The data, collected from 74 schools affiliated with SCIS, shows that 72 per cent of students achieved a high score (‘A’) in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of German students, 69 per cent of French students and 63 per cent of Spanish students also achieved an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now considered as subjects as equally valued as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school programs and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission found that 17 percent of the obstacles to filling jobs were attributed to a lack of language skills, according to employers.
Language skills are thus becoming increasingly important to prepare young people for their future careers.
As more and more jobs require language skills, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he has a real advantage in the future with such a skill for life.
Direct communication with people from abroad automatically gives a multilingual person an advantage over the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation. French was the only language that came out above 10 percent, with a total of 15 percent.
This is why investing in language education is now important for today’s children.
Multiple languages, especially those of emerging economies, will give children a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland, schools choose which languages they teach themselves.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other schools will teach languages that are most important for the UK when they look forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be different languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers specializing in this field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills needed to succeed, regardless of the future.
Currently, it cannot be denied that languages in a global business environment remain vital for the future of the country, so this needs to be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be regarded as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes his debut at the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
Fans waiting for LeBron James’s first game at the Los Angeles Lakers, the wait is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play Sunday in the pre-season opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
We need to determine how many minutes he will play.
“There will be more than one, and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said in a tweet that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his schedule for the Lakers for the six games ahead of the season.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need any pre-season matches to prepare myself,” he said.
Trump's election rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will begin an election rally in Wheeling, West Virginia tonight.
It’s the first of Trump’s five planned rallyes in the coming week, including stops in places that are in his favor, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote on the nomination of the candidate he elects for the vacancy in the Supreme Court has been postponed, Trump wants to build support for the upcoming interim elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when voting in November.
How late is Trump’s rally in West Virginia tonight and how do you look online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, starts tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online via the live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to talk about this week’s hearings for candidate Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who were charged with extra charges of sexual misconduct and the Senate may wait a week to vote on his appointment as the FBI investigates the case.
But the main goal of this series of rallyes is to help Republicans who are candidates for the November elections to gain more momentum.
President Trump’s campaign leadership said these five rallyes are intended to “encourage volunteers and supporters, while Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives.”
“Control over Congress is so important for its program that the president travels to as many states as possible now that the busy campaign season begins,” a Trump campaign spokesman said.
The rally tonight at the Westbank Arena in Wheeling could attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and will be discussed in the Pittsburgh media, West Virginia Metro News said.
It will be the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who remains behind in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to give him a boost in the polls,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is ready to fight to keep the hope alive ahead of Sunday's singles
After three unilateral sessions, Saturday afternoon’s foursomes were perhaps just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging slinger of odds is a fully invented sports concept, but one that players really believe in, and especially in competitions like this one.
So who is currently getting the best chance?
“They first had a six-point lead, and now that’s just four more, so we find a little bit that happiness is on our side right now,” said Jordan Spieth before leaving at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage of having four points in place, while there are twelve in the game.
The Americans find, as Spieth said, that they have a little wind in their sails, and there are many things that give courage, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and scored three points out of four.
Spieth has been a fearsome opponent from tea to green and he sets the good example.
The typical ball sounds he makes when he plays well became louder as his round progressed and he achieved a crucial putt with which match four became a success when he and Thomas were two points behind after two games.
His putt, with which they won the match on 15, was followed by a similar scream, the kind from which you can deduce that he believes the American team has not yet been defeated.
“You have to dig deep and worry about your own game,” Spieth said.
That’s all these players can do now.
18 holes to print your stamp.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
This strange but delicious European duo has four out of four and can do nothing wrong.
‘Moliwood’ was the only duo that didn’t play bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning they avoided bogeys.
As a result of that series, and the way they seem to exchange energy with their noisy audience, they are the players to be defeated on Sunday. If Fleetwood or Molinari wins, he will be the most popular player ever to book a European victory when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at different holes at the same time.
However, it is too early to talk about a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson briefly met Sergio Garcia, the fourball hero of that morning, when he formed a duo with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine led to a drawback for the Spaniards and the Swedes that they could no longer reach.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who can help you get your back.
The four-balls and foursomes are so fascinating to see through the interactions between the duos, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and the way a strategy can change at a glance.
The European team has played the best so far and has a good lead over the last day, but this foursome session has also shown that Team USA is ready to start the fight, something some, especially in the US, have doubted.
Europe takes the lead by 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe starts with a nice lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup. After the four-balls and foursomes of Saturday, they are 10-6 ahead of the United States.
The duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led their team with two wins more than Tiger Woods, who had it difficult, making them now have four points ahead in Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who liked to lose the trophy back in Hazeltine two years ago, was stronger than the blinding Americans in the four-balls in the morning, with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, where it won two games, but could no longer catch up.
Jim Furyk's team must score eight points during Sunday's 12 singles matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who got the nickname ‘Molliwood’, are only the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup to win four points in their four opening matches after a sensational weekend.
After putting Woods and Patrick Reed into the four-balls, they were beautifully played together and defeated a disappointing Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with a powerful 5&4.
Woods, who slipped himself through two matches on Saturday, occasionally showed a splendid move, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in four-balls and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, equipped for the morning four-balls, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and together they defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three in the world, with 2&1.
Yet it did not run from a rented roof for Europe on this pleasant day with a breeze southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who won the Major three times, and Justin Thomas set the standard for the Americans by three points on Saturday.
They won after a difficult match with 2&1 of Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 in the foursomes, after losing the first four holes.
It has only happened twice in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has been able to pick up a four-point delay at the beginning of the singles, although the Furyk team has enough to match, as they currently have the trophy in their hands.
But since they have been in second place for two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems to be too high.
North Korea says it will in no way disarm unilaterally without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions lead to growing distrust in the United States and that the country could under no circumstances unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken “important goodwill measures” last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the location for nuclear tests and promising not to disperse nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“But we don’t see any similar reaction from the US,” he said.
“Without any trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances we will in no way disarm ourselves unilaterally.”
Although Ri reiterated North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea would be rewarded as it takes further steps, it noted that he did not a priori reject unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang had earlier said.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an active US president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim promised to work on the “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” while Trump ordered no-looking guarantees for the vegetation.
North Korea is aiming for a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls for a tightening of international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States is pushing for ‘denuclearization first’ and increasing pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal in a compelling way and even by objecting to the ‘declaration of the end of war’,” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can put us on our knees is an air castle of people who are unaware of us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions are only reinforcing our distrust.”
Ri did not announce plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, something the U.S. leader raised earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the other party on this issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the US, the denuclearization would not have been a failure of the Korean state.
Yet Ri’s speech was significantly different from last year, when he said at the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korean rockets were targeted on U.S. mainland so that after ‘Mr. Evil President’ Trump was a ‘missile man’ on a suicide note.
Trump, who threatened to completely destroy North Korea last year, praised the United Nations this year for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said there is still a lot to be done and that the sanctions must continue until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable for this: “Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday told the UN Security Council: “The enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must be continued vigorously and firmly until we have achieved the full, definitive, verified denuclearization.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously imposed sanctions against North Korea to significantly reduce funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo had a meeting with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
Almost a few hours after he left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, North Korea charged him with making "gang-like demands".
North Korea pledged this month during a meeting with Moon to dismantle a rocket site and also a nuclear complex if the United States “takes corresponding measures.”
He said Kim had told him that the “similar measures” he wanted were security guarantees that Trump had pledged in Singapore, and steps toward normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on the importance of sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University this year ensures that all students get more sleep, in an effort to fight the growing macho culture in which it seems cool to study all night and drink a lot of caffeine.
A professor found that students at the world’s largest university often have no idea of the basic principles of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, set up the course. As far as he knows, this is unique in the United States.
He got the idea to start the course after giving a speech about the influence of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end of my speech, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why am I just getting to hear this now, in my last year?’
She said no one had ever told her how important sleep is, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is organized for the first time this year, explains to students the basic principles of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance and how they also promote their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to organize the course when it was found that students had a severe sleep deficiency during the week.
The course lasts one hour and includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one of the parts, the students see an image of a bedroom, where they click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise appliances and books to learn more about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Using a map of the campus, with interactive pictograms, participants are encouraged to think about their daily routine.
“We know that we will not immediately change the behavior of the students.
But we find that they have the right to know all this, just as people have the right to know the consequences of choosing cigarettes on their health, Ceisler added.
The culture of pride on a night of study still exists, he says, and due to modern technology and increasing pressure on students, sleep deprivation is an ever-increasing problem.
Ensuring enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student’s ‘secret weapon’ to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deficiency causes the brain to give them a constant feeling of hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to set up the course, after which he had attended the professor's lesson last year when he was studying at Harvard in his first year.
He said the course had opened his eyes and had inspired him to make sure the course became available to everyone on campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students to follow a similar curriculum before they come to the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advises students to set an alarm for their bedtime, and not just an alarm to stand up. They should also be aware of the harmful effects of the ‘blue light’ of electronic screens and LED lighting, which can derail your circadian rhythm, causing you to have trouble sleeping in.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal makes Gerrard's men fall
The Rangers saw their outing again disappointing as Dolly Menga scored and Steven Gerrard's weak team defeated by 1-0 in Livingston.
The team of Ibrox hoped for a first win during an outing since they defeated St Johnstone 4-1 in February, but the team of Gary Holt took care of the defeat, barely Gerrard’s second as manager in 18 games. His team is now eight points behind the top of the Lalokes Premier, which is out of Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the rest, and the Rangers failed to score the equalizer.
The Rangers are now in sixth place, Livingston rises to third, with only a difference in the number of goals compared to Hibernian.
And the Rangers could get even more trouble, as border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after apparently an object was thrown at him by the supporters of the visitor team.
Gerrard made eight changes in his squad. They stopped Ayr and went to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt stayed at the same elf for Livingston, who knew how to cut the Hearts one point last week, and he would have been excited about the way his well-trained team managed to block the opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have had the most ball possession, but Livingston was more involved.
They should have scored after two minutes, when Menga left the ball for the first time and Scott Pittman had the goal of Allan McGregor in the vise, but the midfielder could not finish it.
A deep free staircase from Keaghan Jacobs reached leader Craig Halkett, but his fellow defender Alan Lithgow leaped against the rear pole.
The Rangers managed to take control, but they seemed to hope for a good outcome rather than really believe in it if they could approach the goal.
Alfredo Morelos thought he was entitled to a penalty kick when he and Steven Lawless met after playing for a quarter, but arbitrator Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's request.
The Rangers were only able to score twice in the first half, but Liam Kelly, who was a former Ibrox goalkeeper, could easily stop Lassana Coulibaly's headball and Ovie Ejaria's tame shot.
The Opener of Livingston in the 34th minute may or may not be in the prolongation of the overall gameplay, no one can deny that they deserved it, even if it was just for their hard work.
Again, the Rangers were not raised against Jacobs’ deep playing pattern.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained cold-blooded and chose Menga, who easily dropped the ball into the goal.
Gerrard made a break with Coulibaly/Ryan Kent. This move had almost immediate effects when the wingman passed Morelos, but an impressive Kelly race away from his line to stop the ball.
But Livingston continued to force visitors to play a game of the kind that Livingston likes to play, with Lithgow and Halkett continuing to climb long balls.
Holt's team could have increased his lead in the final phase of the game, but McGregor kept up and blocked Jacobs, after which Lithgow came wide from the corner.
Invader Glenn Middleton of the Rangers asked at the end of the game still for a penalty kick after an assault with Jacobs, but Thomson looked back at the other side.
Almanak: the inventor of the Geigertereller
And now a page from the almanac of our ‘Sunday Morning’: 30 September 1882, today exactly 136 years ago, for who can TELL... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm ‘Hans’ Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called geigerter.
The geigerterter has not since gone far from science, and has also become an icon in pop culture, for example in ‘Bells or Coronado’, a 1950 film with the unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What in the name of God is that?”
Rogers: “It’s a gearbox that is used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you set up this headphone, you hear the effect of the atoms emitted by radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: “It’s really ringing now!”
‘Hans’ Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains relevant.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Immune System to ‘See’ Malignant Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Immune System to ‘See’ and Kill Malignant Cells
Vaccine learns immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells in a patient to convert them into a lab.
They can then “see” a protein that often occurs in many cancers and are then re-injected.
A test vaccine delivers promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months
In the method, immune cells are removed in a patient, and the cells in the lab are adjusted so that they can “see” the protein HER2, which is often present in all types of cancer, and then the cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “stimulates the growth of various types of cancer,” including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and bowel cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar way of removing immune cells from patients and ‘learning’ these cells to tackle cancer cells proved to be already working in the treatment of a particular type of leukemia.
Kanye West shuts down pro-Trump tyranny and wears a MAGA hat after his appearance in Saturday Night Live.
It didn't go as he had hoped.
Kanye West was featured during a Saturday Night Live broadcast after an incoherent performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would become presidential candidate in 2020.
After he brought his third song of the evening, Ghost Town, with a pet on his head with the text Make America Great Again, he pitched a tyranny against the Democrats and repeated that he supports Trump.
“Often when I talk to a white man, he asks, ‘How can you sympathize with Trump now?’
“If I was worried about racism, I would have left America for a long time,” he said.
The broadcast of Saturday Night Live began with a parody in which Hollywood star Matt Damon stalked the dragon with the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh in the Senate Commission for Justice in connection with the alleged assault of which Christine Blasey Ford accuses him.
The tyranny of West was not broadcast, but comedian Chris Rock uploaded it on social media.
It's not clear if Rock with his post wants to beat the dragon with West.
West also complained to the public that he had been taken backstage under fire for his pet.
“They’ve pushed me backstage.
They said, “Don’t get on the stage with that pet.”
They've challenged me!
And then they say I'm apathetic," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, ‘Do you want to see how apathetic it looks?’ He said that he would draw her a superman-cape, ‘because that means you can’t command me. Do you want the world to get better?
Give me some love."
From the audience came at least twice book calling and the castle members of SNL seemed embarrassed, according to Variety. The magazine was heard from one attending: ‘The whole studio was suddenly quiet.’
West was too guest as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with a performance of the song I Love It while he was dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from TPUSA leader Candace Turner, who tweeted, “To one of our bravest minds: Thank you for TRUSTING THE MASS.”
But talkshow presenter Karen Hunter tweeted that West was “just herself, and that’s wonderful.”
“But I choose not to reward someone who is hurting, supporting, and spouting an ideology that hurts my community (by buying his music or clothing or ‘supporting’ his art).
He's free to do what he wants.
"We too," she added.
Before the show began, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name. From now on, he says, “the creature that is formally known as Kanye West.”
He is not the first artist to change his name; he was preceded by Diddy Puff, also known as Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Colleague rapper Snoop Dogg also wore the name Snoop Lion, and the late music-adhesive Prince once changed his name to a symbol and then in The artist formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington is looking for toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as swordfighter Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor comes out to the stereotype of the macho field and says that when young boys see such roles on the screen often think they need to be tough to get respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he felt that “something went wrong” and asked himself how the problem of toxic masculinity should be addressed in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his co-star of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, who is also 31, admitted that he is strongly convinced that the problem needs to be addressed.
"This is really an important question for me personally at the moment: where has it gone wrong with our masculinity?" he said.
"What did we teach men when they grew up, which is why we are now confronted with this problem?"
Kit thinks that television may sometimes be partly responsible for the rise in toxic masculinity, due to his very male characters.
He continued, “What is born and what has been learned?”
What is learned on TV and on the street that makes young people think they should be a certain kind of man?
That is, in my opinion, one of today’s big questions: how do we change that?
“There’s something wrong with young people.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not act in prequels or sequels of Games of Thrones when the series is over next summer, as he is "ready with battlefields and horses".
Starting in November, Kit plays a revival of True West by Sam Shepard, the story of a filmmaker and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he feels his meeting with his wife Rose is the most beautiful result of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife during the series, so that's how I left my future family and my life to it from now on," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the great love of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the fantasy series that was awarded an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China says the number of Chinese people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
Health authorities say that more than 820.000 people have been affected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the diseases were transmitted through sex, which was previously not the case.
In the past, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China through transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people who get HIV in this way is now near zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, compared to the same period last year, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality is no longer a crime in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be widespread.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70 to 90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry a woman.
Often the diseases are transmitted by insufficient protection in sexual relations in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff member has leaked data from Republican senators and draws out “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters opposes allegations that one of her staff members has posted the personal data of three U.S. Republican senators on the lawmakers’ Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democrat claims the accusations are being spread by “extreme right-wing” suspects and websites.
“Lies, lies and even more ugly lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published data would include the private address and private phone number of Utah-based U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch.
The data were posted by an unknown in Capitol Hill during a Senate committee hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct at the address of Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for Supreme Court judge.
The leak came after the three senators interrogated Kavanaugh.
According to conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, the IP address indicating the source of the posts was linked to Waters’ office and contained the information of a Waters employee, Hill said.
“This unfounded accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie,” Waters said.
“My employee, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these false accusations, was under no circumstances responsible for the leakage of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie."
Waters’ statement was quickly criticised online, among other things by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
‘This denial sounds angry,’ wrote Fleischer.
“You can conclude from this that she doesn’t have the temperament to be a Congressman.
If someone is accused of something he has not done, he should not be angry.
He must not be rebellious.
He should not question the prosecutor's motives.
He must remain calm and serene.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters’ reaction to the Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of excessive anger during Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who wants to take Waters' place in the midterm elections, also gave his opinion on Twitter.
“Fantastic, if it is true,” he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had informed the relevant services and law enforcement agencies of these false accusations.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are known, and that they are legally held liable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to my staff.”
Review: Johnny English Strikes Again - weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
In every new film with a British influence, we are now traditionally looking for references to Brexit, and that actually turns out to apply to this revival of the Johnny English franchise, the comedic action movies with a sluggish spy in the lead role, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and in 2011 was called back to life with John English.
Is this airy self-satisfaction about how bad we are doing the latest export product for our country?
The incompetent Johnny English, with eye-catching and flexible facial features, manages to send everything in a hundred, even with his second comeback. From his name you can already deduce that he is a general comic character that was designed for cinematographers in countries where one speaks a different language than English.
He is, of course, the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre claim to smooth glamour, has a little Clouseau, a glimpse of Mr Bean and a handful of that guy who contributed one note to the theme number of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
Originally based on the traveler and the internationally mysterious man that Atkinson once played in Barclaycard’s TV spots (which everyone has forgotten in the meantime) that always leaves a certain chaos behind.
His latest portrait of Johnny English contains one or two beautiful moments.
I liked how Johnny English approached a helicopter in his medieval armor and touched the rotor blades against his helmet.
Atkinson can show how much talent he has for physical comedy in this film, but the humor is rather weak and crazy enough, especially now that the "serious" movie series like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves include comedy as an ingredient, and do it well.
The humor seems to be intended for children rather than adults, and Johnny English’s crazy disastrousness comes to me less original and focused than the non-text jokes of the character Bean playing Atkinson.
The constant theme is now that Britain is in great difficulty.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated the supersecret spy network on the web, making the identity of all active British secret agents known, to great dismissal of the agent in office, a unfortunately small role of Kevin Eldon.
This is the drop that makes the bucket of the Prime Minister, a pretentious woman with problems at her head and terribly unpopular as a politician. Emma Thompson does her utmost with this character that makes Teresa May think, but the script does not offer much material to work with.
According to her intelligence advisers, she must employ a retired spy, as each active spy is compromised.
And that means the stunning Johnny English himself, who now works as a schoolmaster in a chic setting, but informally gives lessons about undercover work. Here are funny jokes in the story, because the English spy lessons do think about School of Rock.
English is quickly dismissed at Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former miserable helper Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, and his wife is the captain of an underwater, a silent and jovial role that lies below Vicki Pepperdine's level.
The Batman and Robin of Her Majesty's Secret Service's disastrous states are thus back in action and meet Olga Kurylenko's bloody femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister unfortunately falls for the charms of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their odyssey of crazy dolls fun: disguised as superiors, they set fire to a prominent French restaurant, shove herrie on board the luxury yacht of Volta and English unleashed pure anarchy when he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to get familiar with the interior of Volta's home.
For the latter, all the registers are opened, but no matter how well-intentioned and ruthless the scene, she does something to think of children's television.
It's not all very original.
And just like the other Johnny English films, I ask myself the question: can the British film sector really not now think of a role that honors Rowan Atkinson’s talent?
Labour denies that the party is thinking of a plan in which Britons work four days a week, but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party would consider a radical plan whereby Britons would work four days a week but get paid for five days.
According to reports, the party would like companies to pass on the savings they make as a result of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution to their employees by giving them an extra day of vacation.
For example, employees can enjoy a weekend of three days, but still earn the same amount.
According to sources, the idea “fits” in the party’s economic agenda and plans to overhaul the country’s balance in the direction of the workers.
The transition to a four-day work week has already been approved by the Trade Unions Association, which it finds a good way to ensure that workers can benefit from the changing economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
“It will not happen from one moment to the other, but a four-day working week is a goal that fits within the party’s effort to make the balance in the economy more beneficial to the workers and that also fits within the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
Labour is not the first party to support such an idea, given the fact that the Green Party had already promised a four-day working week in the 2017 national election campaign.
However, the effort is not currently supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “A four-day working week is not a party’s policy intention and is not considered by the party either.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to clarify his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from the “faceless drivers” and the “profits” of utilities.
The Shadow Chancellor’s plans also mean that current shareholders of water companies may not get back the full value of their shares, as a Labour government could apply ‘discounts’ based on perceived misconduct.
He also confirmed that there are plans to include employees in the boards of directors of companies and to set up Inclusive Ownership Funds that give 10 percent of private sector firms shares to employees who can earn up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 a year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their mind
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question of whether the FBI's findings could cause Republican senators to withdraw their support for the candidate.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday at 60 Minutes, Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham or the FBI if they could discover something that could lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open about this than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said before the hearing that I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the accusation came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was resolute, determined, unambiguous."
However, Graham’s voice seems to be walled.
"My opinion about Brett Kavanaugh is firmly established and the charge should contain dynamite," he said.
"As for Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett has strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one who has been named by her could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don’t see any new developments.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it contributed to poverty reduction?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York, an annual music event where a very impressive line-up of stars will take place and which has an equally impressive mission: the end of poverty in the world.
For the seventh time, tens of thousands of people will come to the Great Lawn in Central Park for the Global Citizen Festival. Not only to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes but also to generate awareness for the real goal: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, first organized in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international advocates who hope to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
Concert organizers who wished to earn a free ticket for the event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP ticket) had to complete a series of tasks, or 'actions', such as doing volunteer work, e-mailing a world leader, conducting a phone call, or in any other way meaningful to do so.
But how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been, with another 12 years going to achieve this goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a suitable way to persuade people to call for action or is this just another form of ‘clickivism’, giving people the feeling that they are making a real contribution by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, according to Global Citizen, more than 19 million ‘actions’ of supporters have been registered, targeting a large number of different targets.
According to Global Citizens, these actions have contributed to the commitment of world leaders and to policy proposals worth more than <0x24>37 billion to change the lives of 2.25 billion people by 2030.
Earlier in 2018, the group cited 390 initiatives and statements based on the actions, of which at least <0x24>10 billion has already been paid out or brought together by sponsorships.
The group estimates that the funds obtained so far have had an impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the main intention statements are those of The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and performers from the United Kingdom with the aim of 'helping children realize their full potential'. This group has pledged <0x24>35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country. after receiving more than 4,700 global cits from more than two.
“With the help of the British government, donors, other national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make social injustice a footnote in history,” Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, told the audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that, after more than 5,000 actions were sent asking the British government to improve the nutrition situation for mothers and children, the government has announced a project, the Power of Nutrition, to support that reaches 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the Global Citizen’s website, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
The group replied, "It will be a long and difficult road, where sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the civil rights and anti-apartheid movements ahead of us, we will eventually succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are a few of the artists who will perform this year at the New York event presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. may deploy the navy for a 'blockade' to hinder Russian energy exports - Interior Minister
Washington can take recourse to the navy "if necessary" to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, said Ryan Zinke, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior, as noted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria, where the country acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that they are only in the Middle East to be able to act in energy, just as they are in Eastern Europe and the southern flank of Europe," he said.
And according to the officials, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States has that possibility, with the Navy, to ensure that the shipping routes remain open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy does not come to the market," he said.
Zinke spoke for guests at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that displays itself as the ‘voice of the energy consumer’ in the US.
He went on to compare Washington’s approach to Russia with Iran’s approach, noting that they are not substantially different.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuels,” he said, referring to Russia as a country that only knows an “art” with an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration is trying to boost exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a country that by far offers the cheapest option for European consumers.
For this reason, officials of the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw visibility from the "inappropriate" pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which according to Trump from Berlin has made Moscow's "prisoner".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth <0x24>11 billion, which will double its current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s strong opposition to the project is directed only for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we agree with the view that energy should not be used to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers themselves," said Aleksandr Novak, Russia's energy minister, after a meeting with U.S. energy minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has prompted a response from Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in the project.
The Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI), Germany’s leading industrial organisation, has called on the United States not to interfere in the EU’s energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third power interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren 'thinks seriously after' to take part in the 2020 presidential election, says Senator for Massachusetts
Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator, said on Saturday she was “seriously considering” taking part in the presidential election after the midterm elections.
During a local meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering participating in the election.
"It's time for women to go to Washington to restore the damaged government, and this also means that a woman in the top position," she told The Hill.
“After November 6th, I will seriously think about appointing myself as president.”
Warren executed against President Donald Trump during the meeting in the town hall and said he was "sending this country in the wrong direction".
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing in our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been open-minded in her criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his Supreme Court candidate.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “Of course, we have to wait for an FBI investigation before we vote on it.”
However, a poll published on Thursday revealed that a majority of Warren’s own supporters believe that they should not be elected by 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters said the senator should not be elected, according to an opinion poll from the Political Research Center at Suffolk University and the Boston Globe.
Twenty-three percent of the voters voted for it.
The study showed that there was more support for former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent ahead of a possible nomination and 48 percent against.
Other names of prominent Democrats associated with possible participation in the 2020 presidential election include former vice president Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, a senator from Vermont.
Biden said he would officially make a decision in January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin's PTSS during Donald Trump's election meeting
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after taking office in September.
He was arrested and charged after a report of domestic violence on Monday night.
"By what my own son has to experience, what he is experiencing now that he is back, I have understanding for other families who are experiencing the consequences of PTSD and the injuries that some of our soldiers are returning," she told the audience attending a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other veterans "they come back a little differently, they come back and heavier, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and the pilots and all the other military have given for their homeland."
He was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska on Monday and has been charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, interference in a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon under the influence, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for police in Wasilla.
Washington D.C. and 18 States Support Protest Against New Asylum Policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal protest against a new policy in the U.S. refusing asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and Washington D.C. on Friday filed a “friend-of-the-court” statement in Washington’s court in support of an asylum seeker fighting this policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace vs. Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union brought up against federal policy in August has not been disclosed.
She says her partner "and his violent sons who are members of a gang" abused her but that U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The advocates of the states that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of people who apply for asylum in the United States, as countries that have major problems in the field of gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy has reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals, which made it possible for immigrants without documents fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, the attorney general of Washington, D.C., said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "negates decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal legislation requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such an impediment is contrary to that principle," said the "Friend-of-the-Court" statement.
The lawyers further argue that the policy that denies immigrants access to the United States is damaging the U.S. economy because these immigrants are likely to become new entrepreneurs and provide the country with the necessary workforce.
In June, Justice Minister Jeff Sessions ordered judges to no longer grant asylum to victims of domestic and gang-related violence.
“Asylum is available to those fleeing their country due to persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in a statement on June 11.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all problems, even if these problems are serious, which people face every day, anywhere in the world.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu while the number of deaths doubled in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was also getting worse.
"It feels very excited," said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, while trying to comfort her feverish baby in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute, new bodies arrive in ambulances.
And clean water is scarce."
Residents returned to their ruined homes and searched for valuables in their perennial possessions that they could still use.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals were overcrowded, as long as they were not damaged by the 7.5 earthquake on the Richter scale.
Some wounded, including Dwi Haris, who had a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside because of the chance of severe shocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he told of his feelings when the devastating earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I was printed against the remains of a wall,” Haris told an Associated Press correspondent, adding that he and his family were in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife call for help, and later I heard nothing.
I don't know what happened to her and our child.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of 'Intimidation' with 'Propaganda Ads'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper, praising the mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump recently referred to China Daily’s paid attachment in the Des Moines Register, the best-selling newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of interference in the November 6 U.S. Congressional elections, an accusation denied by China.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere with the U.S. election marked, according to U.S. officials quoted by Reuters, a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in an escalating trade war, in which they have imposed ever-increasing import tariffs on each other.
China's retaliation rates early in the trade war were specifically aimed at hitting exporters in states like Iowa, which support Trump's Republican Party, as Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said China had affected U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
"China," as Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is now doubling the intimidation by publishing propaganda ads in our free press."
“By spreading this propaganda, the Chinese government uses the freedom of expression and a free press, a long-appreciated tradition in America by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, at a kiosk in downtown Beijing you will find voting in vain, and you will not see a true reflection of the divergent opinions the Chinese people may have about the difficult economic trajectory, because the media is firmly under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers has refused to publish his article" if he did not tell which newspaper this was.
Due to the Kavanaugh debacle, Republicans alienated female voters from themselves just before the midterm elections, warn analysts
Now that many important Republicans are gathering around Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate for the Supreme Court, and defending him against various allegations of sexual violence, analysts warn that this will result in a retreat, especially among women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions around this subject have increased tremendously and most Republicans have already made it clear that they want to continue with the vote.
"These things cannot be reversed," Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, told The Hill for an article that appeared on Saturday.
Reeher said he wondered whether the attempt by Senator Jeff Flake (Republican, Arizona) to endorse an FBI investigation at the last minute would be enough to satisfy the angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget tomorrow and they will not forget in November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive MoveOn group, told the Washington, D.C., on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted "November is coming!" during their demonstration in the Senate hall while Republicans who have controlled the Justice Commission chose to approve Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
"The enthusiasm and motivation for the Democrats will reach a record high," Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, told the news site.
“People say it’s already high, and that’s true.
But it can go even further, especially among floating female voters in outskirts and among younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who often do not vote even though they disagree with the president.
Even for Ford’s public testimony, in which she further explained her accusation of sexual harassment against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested that there could be a backlash if the Republicans pressed the nomination.
"This has become a confusing mess for the Republican Party," former Republican Party president Michael Steele told NBC News last week.
“It’s not just about the vote in the committee, or the final vote, or that Kavanaugh takes place in the court, but it’s also about how the Republicans have handled it and how they have handled it,” says Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that doesn’t help Democrats.
The Americans, however, appear to be divided on the question of who they believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a small majority signing for the latter.
A new YouGov poll showed that 41 percent of respondents believed Ford’s testimony for sure or likely, and 35 percent believed Kavanaugh for sure or likely.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh certainly or probably lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s advance, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations of Ford and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford told the Senate Justice Commission that Kavanaugh assaulted her under the influence of drinking when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed her her genitals during a party at the time they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans a new internet to tackle Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest technology legend project, is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which individuals have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that ‘world domination’ is the leading thought behind Inrupt.
“We have to do this now,” he said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid’s technology to enable people to create their own ‘personal online data storage’ or POD.
It can store lists of contacts, activity lists, an agenda, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available together through one browser and all at the same time.
What makes POD unique is the fact that it completely depends on the user who has access to what information.
The company calls this “personal empowerment through data”.
The idea behind Inrupt is, according to CEO John Bruce, that the company provides the resources, processes and skills needed to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a few developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team will not talk to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete transformation that will put all of their business models on their heads at once.
"We do not ask for their consent."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the "mission (of Inrupt) is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new web, which is built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
Berners-Lee will also remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this new era for the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: spiritual and bearer of the Victoria Cross from WO I honored
The only Church of England clergyman to have acquired a Victoria Cross during World War I as a military man is honored 100 years later at his birthplace.
Lieutenant Colonel, the Honourable Bernard Vann received the award following the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed four days later by a sharpshooter, so he never knew that he had been part of the highest British military honour.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the fact that his grandfather was distinguished for.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion on 29 September 1918 across the Saint-Quentin Canal "in a very dense fog and under heavy fire of field shields and machine guns".
He later stormed over to the fire line and led the line forward before running to a field shield alone and knocked out three members of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandparents’ actions were “something I know I can never tick, but also something that makes me feel humble.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid another crown after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very honored to be able to play a role in the parade" and added that "the courage of a real hero is evidenced by the support he receives from a large number of people."
MMA fans stayed up all night to see Bellator 206 and got Peppa Pig instead
Imagine, you’ve been awake all night watching a crowded Bellator 206 and you won’t be able to see the most important moment.
The San Jose ticket featured 13 battles, including six in the main section, and this was broadcast throughout the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their fight, viewers in the UK were unpleasantly surprised when the broadcaster switched over to Peppa Pig.
Some were indignant because they had been awake all night, especially for this battle.
A fan described the transition to the children's program on Twitter as "a bad joke".
“According to government regulations, content that is not suitable for children can no longer be displayed after 6:00 a.m., and that’s why we had to switch to the children’s program,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa is a pig," yessssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
Scott Coker, CEO of Bellator, said they will be adjusting their programming to ensure that viewers in the UK will also get a chance in the future.
"I think, in view of the return game, that we can solve this problem," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning here on a Sunday and we can't discuss anything until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
We're working on it.
When I made the switch, there were a lot of text messages going back and forth and believe me, these were not all equally friendly.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But that was not the case, it was a government problem.
I can promise you this won't happen a second time.
We limit the broadcasts to five nights instead of six, as we normally did already, we tried to make it even better for the fans, but we just went too far.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels 'Inferior' Because Of His Sexual Attitude
Olympic purse jumper Tom Daley says he felt inferior during his youth due to his sexual orientation, but that this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The twenty-four-year-old said that he didn’t realize, until he went to further education, that “not everyone is who I am.”
In an interview with Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 with Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken out about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that parenting had contributed to the fact that he was less attached to winning at the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular presenter of the long-running show, has taken a few months off due to illness.
Apparently a hint at Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less" during his youth than others because it was "socially unacceptable to like both girls and boys."
“To this day, those feelings, the feeling of being less and the feeling of being different are really existing facts that have given me the strength to be successful.”
He wanted to prove that he was “someone” so that he wouldn’t disappoint people if they eventually came after him.
The winner of two bronze Olympic medals has become an outstanding campaigner for the LGBT community and used his presence at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he thought he was happy that he could live publicly without further consequences and that he wanted to give others “hope.”
The three-time world champion said that the fact that he fell in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Back, whom he met in 2013, "has surprised me completely."
Daley was married last year to the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, but said the age difference had never been a problem.
“When you’re so young you have to endure so much,” he participated in his first Olympics at the age of fourteen and his father died of cancer three years later, it’s difficult to find someone in your own age group who has experienced the same highs and lows.
The couple became parents in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me this question last year, I would have answered that it was all about winning a gold medal," he said.
"But you know what, there are more important things on earth than winning gold Olympic medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not accepted that he would die and one of the last things he had asked was if he had already gotten the tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't get over my heart to say, you won't be there anymore to sit on the first row, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and not until his breathing actually stalled and he died, I could finally recognize that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley joined the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew I had dreamed about this all my life. Diving for a home audience during the Olympics, there's no better feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first music choice, Proud by Heather Small, that had touched him strongly on his way to the games and where he still got chicken fur from.
Desert Island Discs can be heard on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, not in shape, on the bench during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he has to find his form back to make it no sad milestone.
Mickelson, who for the 12th time participated in the two-year event, a record, was placed on the bench by team captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has often done for the United States, the winner of five majors splits the day between supporting his teammates and exercising on the driving range, in an attempt to find out where it is suspended.
Because even at the peak of his career he was never known for his straight drives, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the narrow fairways of Le Golf National, where the long grass of the roughly rolling balls routinely penalizes.
And if the race itself isn’t scary enough, Mickelson comes in the ninth game on Sunday, the always accurate Francesco Molinari, the winner of the British Open, against who is tied to newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans who are four points behind at the start of the 12 single matches start well, Mickelson’s match can be absolutely crucial.
Furyk has shown to have confidence in this man, although he could honestly hardly say otherwise.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a blow on my back, hit his arm around me and said he's ready for it tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He has been included in the Hall of Fame and he has contributed so much to these teams, in the past, but also this week.
I probably didn’t expect him to play just two games.
I expected more of it, but it's as it is and it's the way we think we should act.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson can improve Nick Faldo's record for the highest number of Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
It can also mean the end of a Ryder Cup career in which he has never completely matched the highlights of his personal career.
Mickelson has won 18 matches, lost 20 matches and played 7 equals in his name, but Furyk said his presence had a certain unmistakable influence on the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's caught, he likes to make jokes with people and he's a great guy to have in the team," he explained.
"I think the younger players liked to keep him crazy from time to time last week, which was funny to see.
He has so much more to offer than just his game.”
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows that big advantage can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that the comfortable lead before the singles on the last day of the Ryder Cup, can easily turn into a less comfortable situation.
The Danes made their debut in the match in Valderrama in 1997, where the team with captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but eventually the finish line passed with the smallest possible margin: 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just," said Bjorn, unveiled here, after he had seen winning the 2018 lighting with 5-3 on Friday and a good 10th for a National Golf jump.
So history shows me and all the others in the team that this is not a game played yet.
Everyone will have to make a full commitment tomorrow.
Go ahead and execute the plan on the right.
It's not over until the points are on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to win this trophy, and that is what we need to keep focusing on.
I keep saying, I’m focusing on the 12 players we can have, but we’re also aware of the people on the other side, some of the best players in the world.”
Glad about the performance of his players on a challenging golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never make progress on things in this area.
Tomorrow another challenge awaits.
Tomorrow the individual achievements will come to an end, and that is again a completely different discipline.
It’s great to be out there with a partner if it goes well, but when you stand alone, your abilities as a golfer are only really being tested.
That’s the message you need to tell the players, try to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
So now let your partner go and he has to get the most out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, expects his players to perform better individually than as partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who won three of the four points.
Furyk himself has experience with both sides of this kind of reversal on the last day, as a member of the winning team in Brookline and as a loser when Europe realized the 'Miracle of Medina'.
"I remember every damn word of that speech," he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had picked up his players for the last day.
"We have 12 major matches for tomorrow, but let's try to get started, like in Brookline, or like in Medinah.
When we have the momentum, there is a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
We have tailored our line-up to this and send the men on their way in the order that we think is the best and, you know, we're going to try to spell something out of the high hat tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of trying to lead the counteroffensive and puts Rory McIlroy in for the first match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the first half of the squad.
"I chose this group in this order because I think we are so constantly covered," Bjorn said of his selection of singles players.
Germany's new warship has been postponed
The newest frigate of the German navy should have come into service in 2014, replacing the outdated warships from the Cold War era, but it will take at least another year before it is ready, due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the 'Rheinland-Pfalz', the leading ship in the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman.
The ship should have been part of the navy in 2014, but the worrying problems after delivery have plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered by the navy in 2007 serve as a replacement for the outdated Bremen class frigates.
As far as we know, they have a powerful cannon, a range of air defense and anti-ship missiles, and a form of stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic features.
Other important features are longer maintenance cycles, it should be possible to install the latest frigates up to two years in a row, far from home ports.
The continuing delays mean, however, that the advanced warships, designed to allow Germany to project its power overseas, are already outdated by the time they are put into operation, Die Zeit notes.
The fatal frigate F125 has already reached the headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons behind the return, but German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that would render the warship useless if it were deployed in a combat mission.
Software defects were especially important because the vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, half the crew on the frigates of the older Bremen class.
It was also made clear that the ship was severely overweight, resulting in less performance and limited capabilities of the navy to carry out further upgrades.
The Rhineland-Palatinate weighs 7,000 tons, which is twice as much as ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the price tag for the entire project, including the training of the crew, becomes even a problem.
It is said that this has reached a dizzying <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion, compared to the original <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems that the latest frigates have in their grip are becoming particularly important due to recent warnings that the German navy is declining power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the parliamentary defence committee in Germany, acknowledged that the navy actually "has a shortage of usable ships".
The official said the problem has grown over time as a snowball, because old ships were pulled out of business but no replacement ships were delivered.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were yet available to be included in the navy.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Mice
New research, which is being conducted on a property in the Scottish highlands, is trying to reveal how meat mice use the landscape in their search for food.
The hope is that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and will contribute to future conservation activities.
The study, carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, follows the ordinary and small dwarf mice, the brown grand mice and the water mice at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed at key locations around the property to monitor the activities of the meat mice throughout the season.
NTS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the beetles of the meat mice and what kind does what.
Then a map of the habitat and a report are produced to create a detailed picture on a landscape scale of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, hopes that the results will show which areas of the habitat are most important for rats and how they are used by the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as making grasslands and how we can best maintain the forests for carnivores and similar species.
Flea mice populations in Scotland and the rest of the UK have declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that affect sleeping places and the loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and flashes can also pose a risk, just like airplanes and certain chemical treatments of building materials and attacks by house cats.
Flemish mice are not actually blind.
However, because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a prey.
They use an advanced echo location technique to determine the position of insects and obstacles in their flight path.
At the NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, meat mice are taken very seriously.
The NTS has ten trained experts, who conduct regular inspections, sleep inspections and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization has even set up the first and only meat mice reserve in Scotland at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten species of meat mice in Scotland live.
Landscape Manager David Thompson says the estate is the ideal territory for the meat mice.
"Here in Threave we have a great environment for meat mice," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many very old trees and the right habitat.
But so much is not yet known about meat mice and therefore the work we do here and in other locations will help us better understand what they need in order to thrive."
He stressed the importance of checking meat mice before maintenance work is carried out, as the possible unconscious destruction of a sleeping place could lead to the death of 400 female meat mice and their boys, potentially eliminating a full local population.
Flemish mice are a protected species of animal and it is illegal to kill them, to cause trouble or disturb them, or to destroy their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish official for the Bat Conservation Trust, has asked the public to make a contribution to help.
She said, “We still need to learn a lot about our meat mice and many of our species we simply don’t know how they’re doing with their populations.”
Ronaldo rejects allegations of assault as his lawyers prepare to prosecute a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the allegations of assault “fake news” and said people wanted to “promote themselves” by using his name.
His lawyers are about to appeal the German weekly Der Spiegel, in which the allegations are published.
The tip of Portugal and Juventus is accused of assaulting an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is also accused of paying her <0x24>375,000 to remain silent about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Through a video for his 142 million followers on Instagram Live, 33-year-old Ronaldo, a few hours after the accusations were reported, called the reports "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they say today is fake news," said the winner of five Golden Balls on camera.
“They want to promote themselves by calling my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by mentioning my name, but that's part of the business.
I'm a happy man, and by and by good," the footballer added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit in which they want to prosecute Der Spiegel for the allegations they called "an unacceptable reporting of suspicions of privacy," according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, a lawyer, said the footballer wants compensation for the "moral damage for an amount corresponding to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the footballer’s room, where he allegedly raped her anal, as read in the indictment filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was a “good guy” for “99 percent,” but that he is sometimes left behind that “one percent”.
The documents say that Ronaldo confirms that the couple had sex, but that this was mutually agreeable.
Mayorga also claims she went to the police and took pictures of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to an extrajudicial arrangement because she was "afraid of the consequences" and worried about the "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old now says she wants to invalidate the arrangement because she has been permanently traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of going from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged attack and this summer went to Italian giant Juventus in a deal worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: the UK 'will be forever sorry' if car manufacturers leave
The United Kingdom "will be eternally sorry" if it loses its status as a world leader in automotive production after Brexit, said Greg Clark, Minister of Economic Affairs.
He added that it was "concerning" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK would leave the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily shut down production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of delays at the border would cost jobs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
The factory in Burnaston, where Toyota’s Auris and Avensis are manufactured, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other countries in the European Union.
“My vision is that if the UK crashes out of the EU at the end of March, we will see production in our factory stall,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director in Burnaston.
Other car products in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also voiced concerns about the consequences of leaving the EU without an agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW has already announced that it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
Most car manufacturers are concerned about risks in the supply chain in the event of a ‘no-deal Brexit’.
Toyota’s production line runs on the ‘just-in-time’ principle, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and in the EU for cars made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be unrest at the borders that industry believes could lead to delays and lack of parts.
Toyota cannot store stock for more than one day at the Derbyshire factory, the company said, and therefore production would be stopped in that case.
Clark said Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was “exactly tailored to avoid those checks at the border.”
"We need to have a deal. We want to have the best deal, which will enable us not only to continue the current success, but also to take this opportunity," he told listeners on BBC Radio 4' Today.
“The proof, not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, is that we absolutely need to be able to continue with this very successful supply chain.”
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but warned in the longer term that the additional costs would affect the company’s competitiveness and that it would eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years, and who is a representative of the Unite trade union at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once these jobs have been lost, they will never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump and Rosenstein’s meeting could be delayed again, the White House says
The crucial meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed "another week" as the fight over Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who is investigating the Russian influence of the election, links between Trump and Russia’s assistants and possible obstruction of the president’s trial.
Asking whether Trump is going to fire the deputy prosecutor-general and thus jeopardize Mueller’s independence, the Washington looting machine has been running for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and to postpone the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But when he went to the White House last Monday, there were rumors that he was about to file his resignation.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he didn’t want to fire Rosenstein, but then the assembly was moved to avoid a conflict with a hearing on the Senate Justice Committee, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, were asked to be both.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, delaying the vote in the entire Senate.
On Sunday, Sarah Sanders, Trump’s chief press officer, appeared on Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There is not yet a date for it, it could be this week, but it could also be postponed for another week, given all the other things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see and I’ll always like to keep the press informed.”
Some reporters have struggled with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the shortage of press conferences was not caused by a dislike of the "attractive" TV journalists, though, she added: "I will not deny that they are trying to attract attention."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president does more question-and-answer sessions for him than any president," she said, without providing evidence: "We've looked at the figures."
Press conferences will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has a chance to ask the President of the United States directly, that's infinitely better than talking to me.
“We’re trying to do a lot of that and you’ve seen us do that often in recent weeks and that will take the place of a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends public sessions or during press conferences with dignitaries who are visiting.
Press conferences with only the president are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, he made an open-hearted and sometimes bizarre appearance for the gathered reporters.
Minister of Health writes letter on Brexit to NHS Scotland employees from other EU countries
The Minister of Health has written a letter to EU staff working in the NHS Scotland to express the country’s gratitude and wish they will continue to work with the NHS after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter with less than six months to leave the UK.
The Scottish government has previously declared its willingness to bear the costs of applying for a fixed status for EU citizens working for decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer the negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued, and this autumn the expected decisions will be taken.
At the same time, however, the UK government has also suspended preparations for a possible scenario where no deal is reached.
I know that these should be uncertain times for all of you.
That is why I would like to stress once again how much I appreciate the contribution of all staff members, irrespective of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the NHS and provide benefits for the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we would like you to stay here.”
Christian Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgery yesterday after having suffered a major injury in the 31-27 losing game against the Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ of Tennessee reported.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the accident took place shortly before rest.
"He came to the sideline and fell there more or less," Reed said.
The trainers and the medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen directly on the sideline, before they put him on a stretcher and took him with them for further investigation.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come from the surgical chamber at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are still no details about the type/size of the injury" and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a 'redshirt sophomore', is in its first season at Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He was hit a total of five times on Saturday before leaving the field, giving him a total of 18 times this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher fees when buying a house in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher taxes when buying a home in the UK and the proceeds are used to help homeless people according to new Conservatives plans
This action will have to neutralize Corbyn’s success to attract young voters
The increase in vacancies will be imposed on persons who do not pay tax in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects this to raise <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher rents when they buy a home in the UK and the extra income is used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn, who attracts young voters with promises to provide more affordable homes and to tell this story on multi-earners.
The increase in vacancies is imposed on individuals and firms who do not pay tax in the UK, with the additional income being invested in an attempt by the government to combat homelessness.
The surcharge, which goes up to the current levels, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second houses and houses purchased for rent, can go up to 3%.
The Ministry of Finance is thus expected to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of the new construction in London is bought by non-UK residents, which raises prices and makes it difficult for beginners to get a foot on the floor.
Many prosperous areas in the country, especially in the capital, have practically become 'sponge cities' due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson had advocated for a reduction in doctors to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping their prices high by buying land and not using it, and called on May to abolish quotas on affordable homes to restore the housing scarcity in Britain.
Corbyn has announced a remarkable series of housing reforms, including rent ceilings and an end to deportation 'without negligence'.
He also wants to give local authorities more opportunities to build new homes.
“Last year, I said I wanted to spend my time as Prime Minister restoring the ‘British Dream’, that life will be better for every new generation.
And that means that our defective housing market needs to be restored.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be that it is as easy for people who do not live in the UK, and for foreign companies, to buy homes here as it is for hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a house has once become a vague dream and the humiliation of life without a roof above the head is already a reality.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland"
Jack Ross, the boss of Sunderland, says it’s his “ultimate ambition” to ever become Scotland’s manager.
De Schot, 42, enjoys the challenge of reviving the club from northeast England, currently third in League One, at three points from the first place.
He went to the Stadium of Light last summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“As a footballer, I wanted to play for my country.
But I was selected for the B team and the race was over," Ross told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
“When I was a child, I saw Scotland playing with my father often in Hampden Park and it’s something that keeps me attracted.
However, that opportunity would not come until I succeed in managing a club.”
Ross' predecessors as managers of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic says he was not intimidated to become the successor to these established names at a major club, rather he had refused advances from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me right now is measured by 'Can I let this club return to the Premier League?'
Due to the structure and facilities at this club, it is undoubtedly in the Premier League,” he said.
"It's not an easy task to achieve this, but I can only see myself as successful if I bring the club back there."
Ross has only worked as a manager for three years, after a period as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months in the coaching group of Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from degradation to the third division and he transformed St Mirren from on the edge of degradation to winning the Championship in the following season.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than he ever did during his career as a footballer at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably really a crossroads," he recalled from the moment he took over leadership at Alloa.
“I really believed that management was the right choice for me, much more than playing.
It sounds weird, because I did the best I could, I was fairly well earned and I have known a few reasonable highlights.
Soccer can be difficult.
There are a lot of things that you face every week.
I still have that, given the stress and pressure of the field, but management just feels good.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager and now that I’m real, I’m as good in my skin as I’ve never felt in my adult life.”

The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 on a Saturday, reveals research
The heat wave in the summer has increased the incomes of British pubs that struggle to survive, but has also put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Groups with pubs and bars saw revenues increase by 2.7 percent in July, but revenues in restaurants were 4.8 percent lower, the figures show.
Peter Martin, of CGA’s business advisory firm, which collected the figures, said: “Continuous sunshine and the fact that England took part in the world championships for longer than expected meant that July showed a similar pattern as June, when the pubs were now making 2.8 percent more than expected.
The fall of 1.8 percent in restaurant turnover in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars that are focused on beverage sales performed by far the best, with better LFL growth (like-for-like) than restaurants falling.
Pubs that are also focused on the sale of food are also members of the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurants.
It seems that people just go out there to drink.
In pubs and bars under management, beverage revenue was 6.6 percent higher for the month, while food revenue was 3 percent lower.
Paul Newman of RSM, analyst for the leisure and hospitality industry, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of important social or sporting events remain the biggest factors for revenue in the spending market.
It is therefore no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a turnover of 4.8 percent year-on-year is particularly painful given the ongoing cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food-focused operators and only time will learn whether the more moderate temperatures of August can give the necessary respite."
Total revenue growth in the pub and restaurant sector, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the decline in the introduction of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the turnover monitor for the UK’s pub, bar and restaurant sector, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion. This is the industry’s established benchmark.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they keep hidden from their parents.
One in five children, some not older than 11 years old, have a secret social media account, which they keep secret from parents and teachers, reveals a survey
Survey of 20,000 high school students reveals growth in ‘fake Insta pages’
This news has reinforced the fear that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students say they have a ‘master account’ that they also show their parents
One in five children, some not older than 11 years old, create social media accounts that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in the ‘fake Insta accounts’, a reference to Instagram, the photo sharing site.
This news has reinforced the fear that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of students say they use a clean ‘head office’ account that they show to their parents while they also have personal accounts.
A mother who accidentally came to the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered there a teenager who asked others to "rape" her.
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and HMC (Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles and that half allowed them to keep personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HCM, said: “It’s worrying that so many teens are being tempted to create online spaces where they’re not found by their parents and teachers.”
Eilidh Doyle to Become the 'Voice of the Athlete' in the Scottish Athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of the Scottish Athletics World, as non-executive director at the Annual General Meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland on the field and in the field and President Ian Beattie described her election as a great opportunity for sports drivers to learn from her extensive experience at an international level over the past ten years.
"Eilidh enjoys a lot of respect in the athletics community of Scotland, the UK and the world and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit enormously from her election to the Council," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am happy to be able to serve as a voice for the athletes and I hope to be able to make a contribution and help drive the sport in Scotland."
The American who won the 200 metres and the 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games, two of his four gold Olympic medals, and who now regularly comments on the BBC, could no longer walk after a TIA.
He wrote on Twitter: “Today I had a TIA.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors told me that only time will learn whether or not I will recover and to what extent.
It’s been terrible hard work, but now I’ve completely recovered, I’ve learned to walk again and do my flexibility exercises again today!
Thank you for all your support statements!”
Breast pump ad in which mothers are compared with cows, distributes online opinion
A company that makes breast pumps has shared the online opinion with an ad in which breastfeeding mothers are compared to cows being breastfed.
To mark the introduction of what is called “the quietest portable breast pump in the world”, consumer technology producer Elvie has released an ironic, music video-inspired advertisement to illustrate the freedom this new pump has to offer to boiling mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a mud-filled barn on a song that contains lyrics like, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but you can't see anything from it" and "In case you didn't mind, these aren't oats, these are my breasts."
The refrain then goes on to say, "Pumps, pumps, pumps, I feed the babies, pumps, pumps, pumps, I milk the lady's."
However, the ad, which was published on the company’s Facebook page, immediately caused an online controversy.
The video has been viewed 77,000 times and has sparked hundreds of comments, especially mixed reactions from viewers, in which many people say that it compensates the 'horror' of the dairy industry.
"A bad choice to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they should be expected to be born to produce milk, but in their case, the babies will be taken away within a few days after giving birth.
Elvie's breast pump fits discreetly into a nutritional bra (Elvie/Mother).
Someone else noted: “This is, of course, traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why don’t we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to hold their babies?”
Another person added: "This advertisement is so far from reality."
Others defended the ad and a woman admitted that she found the song 'hilarious'.
“I think this is a genius idea.
I would buy one if I was still breastfeeding.
That pump gave me the feeling of being a cow.
The ad is a little weird, but I haven't been looking for it too much.
“This is a great product,” someone wrote.
Someone else had the following remark: "This is a funny ad, aimed at moms who piss (often in the workplace or in a toilet) and then feel just 'cow'.
This advertisement is not at all positive or negative about the dairy industry."
At the end of the video you will see the group of women who are all dancing with the pump discreetly hidden in their thighs.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the understanding that many women who piss sometimes feel like cows.
The Elvie Pump, however, is completely silent, has no wires or hoses and fits discreetly in a nutritional bra, so women have the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out while they are on plungers.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, says: “The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a strong and provocative introduction.
By comparing breastfeeding mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to put the piston and the associated challenges in the headlights and at the same time show in a entertaining and understandable way how the new pump will provide an incredible sense of freedom.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has reached the front page.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on Marta Jakubowski’s catwalk while using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Silently Moved to Tent Camp on Texas Border
The number of migrant children detained has peaked, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and the harsh policies introduced by the Trump administration make it harder to bring children to sponsorship.
Traditionally, most sponsors are themselves undocumented immigrants and are afraid of putting their own chances of staying in the country at risk by registering for a child.
That risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to leave their fingerprints and that this data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said in a statement to the congress that his organization has arrested dozens of people who have signed up as sponsors for undocumented minors.
The organization later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees did not have a preliminary criminal record.
“Almost 80 percent of the people who are sponsors or family members of the sponsors are illegal in this country, and much of it is criminal foreigners.
We're prosecuting these people," said Mr. Albence.
In an attempt to process the children faster, officials have introduced new rules, making some of them obliged to appear before the court within one month after the start of the detention, rather than within 60 days, which was previously the standard, according to the staff at the shelter.
Many of them will stand before the court via videoconferencing, rather than in person, to discuss their application for legal status for an immigration judge.
Those who are considered not eligible for assistance will be deported soon.
The longer the children remain in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape, according to the shelter staff and according to reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Lawyers said these concerns are stronger at a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where the signs that a child is struggling are more often ignored, due to the size of the camp.
They added that moving the children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally for this or to say goodbye to friends can contribute to the trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria Recommends US, France and Turkey’s ‘Occupational Power’ to Resign Immediately
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Muallem also called for the return of Syrian refugees, even now that the war in the country is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said foreign troops are illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of combating terrorism and that "this will be done accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the Assembly.
According to Moualem, the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been derailed and expelled from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue “this holy struggle until we have liberated all Syrian territories” from terrorist groups and “an illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly engaged in training and advising the Kurdish troops and the Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
Regarding the refugees, Moualem said the conditions were favorable for their return and he refused to "spread some Western countries' irrational fears" that would keep most refugees away.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return,” he said.
“They are politicizing a matter that should only be a humanitarian problem.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be available for Syria until a political agreement is concluded between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major rebel stronghold, has created the opportunity to start political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey has deterred a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian troops on the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the deal has "clear deadlines" and said he hoped the military action would target jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who "will be eradicated".
Staffan de Mistura, the UN deputy, hopes to convene soon the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem clarified what the Syrian government's conditions for participating in the committee were, saying the work of the panel should be limited to "revising the articles of the current constitution" and he warned against outside interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to that logic, Trump would win the elections in 2020 unless, as many "liberal" viewers likely hope, his presidency is terminated prematurely by a deposition procedure and scandals.
In what would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of a presidency ever”?
At the moment, however, there are no signs of visual impairment.
Since 2014, CNN’s prime-time views have more than doubled to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during prime-time, compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, and MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow Show is at the top of the ratings for cable programs with 3.5 million viewers on nights with major news.
"This is a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, the head of the ABC drama Designated Survivor, a series about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club" has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston for the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Scovell told me.
There is entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else on TV, the storylines coming from Washington can influence the future of Roe v. Wade or determine whether immigrant families can reunite or influence the status of the world economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond wanting to be a well-informed citizen clerk, when you’re aware that you’ve been watching a panel of experts for six hours now, discussing the use of sources from the ‘deep background’ by Bob Woodward in his book ‘Fear’, which has been talking about the <0x24>5,000 jack of Mana’s pawn’s leash.
I will never be able to look at Super Mario again in the same way.
"What he's doing to give you the idea that it's a reality show is in part that he's adding something new to you every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of Pawn Stars, about the Trump show's rotational role-sharing.
You can’t afford to miss a episode or you have the idea that you’re following.
When I reached Fleiss earlier this week, it was sunny and 26 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he was sitting inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not get out of the screen, with Brett Kavanaugh appearing before the Senate Justice Commission and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I remember we did all those weird shows, not so long ago, and that the people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but now it turns out they were right.”

Money from outside flows in the most exciting interim elections for the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania sees an influx of money, thanks to a restructuring of an electoral district that has forced two sitting people to fight for the same seat.
The recently reorganized Pittsburgh district meets Democratic People's Representative Conor Lamb, who has acquired his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb must take the lead against another sitting People's Representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, who is much overlap with the new 17th District.
The maps were reclassified after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January ruled that the old districts were unconstitutionally classified ('gerrymandering') in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has led to a campaign-financing squad between the financial arms of the two major parties, the DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a nip victory in a well-watched special election for the 18th Pennsylvania constituency.
This seat has been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump had conquered this district by 20 percentage points.
According to political experts, the Democrats have a small advantage.
The U.S. considers punishing El Salvador for supporting China and has refused to do so.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama Beijing had already recognized and received little negative response from Washington.
Trump had a heartfelt meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and he owned a hotel in Panama until his partners put out the management team of the Trump Organization.
U.S. State Department officials have decided to call back the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the “recent decision not to recognize Taiwan anymore,” said Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the U.S. government.
But only penalties were considered in the case of El Salvador, as the country received <0x24>140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, for drug control, development and economic support.
The penalties proposed, including reductions in financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have become painful for the Central American country with high unemployment and high murder rates.
As internal meetings continued, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference, which would focus on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent the United States from migrating.
But in mid-September, some senior government officials announced they wanted the conference to continue, making all possible sanctions against El Salvador impossible in advance.
The plan is now that Vice President Mike Pence will give a speech at the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the government’s importance to the meeting, diplomats say.
And the three U.S. envoys have returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further lifting, without harsh messages on Washington’s sanctions.
A White House spokesman on behalf of Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal discussion on condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who was also close to the government and spoke on condition of anonymity.
Studying the history
The next step could be the report by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on Trump’s possible interference with justice, for which heavier evidence has now become public.
Mueller’s research is likely to also focus on co-operation between Trump’s campaign and Russia in an attack by Russia on our elections.
If Congress changes color, Trump must hold himself accountable for that institution, just as he prepares to turn to voters again, and perhaps he should go to a jury in a court of law.
That’s a lot of myths, and I don’t want to suggest that Trump’s fall is inevitable, nor that of his equivalents in Europe.
We will all have to make choices on both sides of the Atlantic, which will determine how long the battle will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a "coup d'état" against Hitler, but only if the West had offered resistance and Czechoslovakia had supported in Munich.
We failed and thus missed an opportunity to prevent the years of bloodshed that followed.
The course of history revolves around such bends, and the relentless progress of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are currently facing various of these types of bending points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who has the fate of Mueller's investigation in his hands?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since the time this magazine reported that he, last year, had suggested to cover up conversations with the president and that he had speculated about the president’s suitability for his office.
Rosenstein says the Times report is wrong.
“How will we respond if the FBI’s new requested investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or unfair, or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of assault and an unfair testimony?
And above all, will we go to vote in the interim elections for a Congress that will call on Trump to account?
If we fail in these tests, democracy awaits a very long winter.
But I believe that we will not fail by the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador’s residence.
She survived it, immigrated to America and sent me, 60 years later, to light candles for the Sabbath on that table depicting a swastika.
With that as my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrans of Glasgow Rangers is optimistic about the game against Rapid Vienna
Rangers will visit Rapid Vienna on Thursday and know that a victory over the Austrians, after the impressive match in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, puts them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
Due to a knee injury, midfielder Graham Dorrans was unable to play his first game of the season until the 2-2 match at Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a jumping board for better results.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal really has a good eleven," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game with the idea that there was something to win and came out of the game with a point.
Maybe we could have even won at the end, but seen throughout the game, an equal game is likely to be a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, but when we came out in the second half, we were the better team.
Next Thursday is a new big European evening.
Hopefully we can get three points but it will be a difficult game because they also had a good result in their last game, but if the audience is behind us, I’m sure we can push through and we can get a positive result.
Last year has certainly been a tough year, of everything that happened to my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a feeling-good factor on the club.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it. The training is good.
Hopefully we can push through now, leave the last season behind and be successful again.”
Women can't sleep because of fear of their retirement
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they want to receive care, few people discuss this with their family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide survey said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
And only 10 percent said they had spoken to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they are not taking the steps necessary to conduct this conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here we go.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of it if you don’t make your wishes known well in time.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Take a financial advisor into your arms: Your advisor can also give you advice on how you can pay for these expenses.
Your financing choices for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash worth to help cover these expenses, or investing your own assets as insurance, as long as you have money.
Set up your legal documents: Avoid legal disputes when the insurance is to be used.
Ensure a health care authority so that you can appoint a trusted person who can oversee your medical care and make sure the professionals stick to your wishes in case you can no longer communicate.
Also consider a power of attorney for your financial affairs.
In that case, you select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure the invoices are paid if you can’t do it yourself anymore.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly father or mother is in a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
In that case, can you answer questions about medication and allergies?
Put these details in a written plan so that you have the information at hand.
"It's not just the financial matters that matter, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"Which medications are used?
Who takes care of the dog?
Make sure that plan comes along.”
Man shot several times with air-pressure gun in Ilfracombe

Agents described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a 'willful act'.
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police have called witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to continue to rise.
Due to the shutdown of the means of communication, the official authorities have not yet received information from the regency of Donggala, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Midden-Celebes and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th birthday when the tsunami struck.
Dongala is a regency that extends over more than 300 km along the coast of northwest Celebes.
The regency, an administrative region just below a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main activities in the economy of the province of Middle Celebes, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mostly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis regularly over the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Control Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami claimed more than 200 lives and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck in western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is often affected by earthquakes.
Here is a list of some of the worst earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesian province of Atjeh in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries and claimed a total of 226,000 lives along the coasts of the Indian Ocean, more than half of which in Atjeh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes occurred on the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.8 on the Richter scale occurred south of Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, and caused a tsunami that hit the south coast and claimed nearly 700 lives.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 on the Richter scale hit the city of Padang, the capital of the West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 on the Richter scale hit one of the Mentawai islands off the coast of Sumatra, causing a tsunami of more than 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and claimed about 300 lives.
2016: An opaque earthquake hit the Pidie rainforest in Atjeh and caused devastation and panic, as people were reminded of the devastations of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Several earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, Alaska's former governor and vice presidential candidate, has been arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and offering opposition during the verdict, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged abuses, he took the phone away from her.
Palin is held in custody in the Mat-Su detention house with a deposit of <0x24>500, KTUU reported.
He appeared to the court on Saturday and declared himself "innocent, for sure" when asked about this, the network reported.
Palin is charged with three Class A offences, which means he can be sentenced to one year in prison and a fine of up to <0x24>250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B offense, which is punishable by a day in prison and a <0x24>2,000 fine.
It is not the first time Palin has been charged with criminal offences.
In December 2017, he was accused of abusing his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, then called the police to report the alleged abuse.
This case now serves the Alaska Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic abuse, interference with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon under influence in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed that he had hit her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by a veteran group after she linked her son’s violent behavior to PTSS, which he would have continued to serve in Iraq.
Indonesia, earthquake, tsunami: hundreds dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale led to a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been shut down while the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake took place just next to the center of Celebes, located northeast of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
There are videos circulating on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutors Call for Rare Death Penalty for Suspect of Terrorist Attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York demand the death penalty for Sajfoello Sajpov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack, in which eight people were killed, a rare punishment that has not been executed in this state since 1953.
Sajpov, 30, allegedly used a rented truck from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, driving pedestrians and cyclists who came on his path in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Sajpov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" sustained serious physical injuries, according to the statement of intent demanding the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
For both charges, the death penalty is possible, according to the document submitted to the court.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury approved the indictment with 22 charges, including eight charges of murder for a rocket, typically a charge used by federal prosecutors against organized crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and preparation," according to the prosecutors, and they described the way in which Sajpov carried out the attack as "abusive, cruel and corrupt".
"Sajfoello Habiboellajevitch Sajpov has inflicted injury, damage and loss on the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco."
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It is more than a decade ago that a case in the Southern District of New York occurred demanding the death penalty.
The suspect, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple that was executed after they were convicted two years earlier of espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were both executed by the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Sajpov, who is from Uzbekistan, did not show any remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told the detectives that he felt good about his actions, the police.
Sajpov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the accusation.
He also asked to hang the flag of ISIS in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the defamation with 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Sajpov, said he was "naturally disappointed" with the prosecutors' decision.
“We think that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting a confession in return for a life sentence without the possibility of being released will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved,” Patton said.
Sajpov’s defense had earlier asked the prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative MP Says Nigel Farage Should Lead Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage today promised to mobilize a "people's army" during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
Ukip’s former leader said politicians should “feel the warmth” of the Eurosceptics, while one of May’s own MPs suggested giving him the lead in the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the participants of the Birmingham march that the UK "would have been out" if Mr Farage had been Brexit minister.
But the challenge May is facing to reconcile the heavily divided gangs is underlined by two conservatives who are pro-Remain and who participate in a separate protest rally against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise on track as it is being attacked by Brexiters, Remainers and the EU.
Members agreed that she would continue and try to conclude a deal with Brussels despite the defeats, forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and "chaos".
Bone said at a meeting of Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wants to 'toss Chequers in the basket'.
He suggested that Farage should be deployed and be held responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he did the service, we'd be out of it now," Bone said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I will support Brexit, but we have to throw Chequers in the trash bin."
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in two world wars to be subordinate.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone made suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely false.”
Conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the march and told reporters: “I’m just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not voting, it is unpopular with our party and with our activists who go door to door and make sure we are elected.
Let the Chequers fall down and listen."
In a message to May, she added: “Premiers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Farage told the meeting that politicians should feel “heated” if they want to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them, 'We're not letting you get out of here.'
In a message to the enthusiastic masses, he added: “I want you to expose our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, to the flames.
We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country that has secured us the victory in the Brexit referendum and we will never rest until we have become an independent, sovereign, proud United Kingdom again.”
In the meantime, Remainers marched through Birmingham and concluded this march with a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
A small group of activists swaddled with Tories Against Brexit flags following the establishment of this group over the weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour House, made jokes about the security issues of a Conservative party app at the start of their conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can provide IT systems and all technology for Canada plus, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's a full farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to ‘get good thinking’ about running for president
Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "think well about her candidacy for the presidency" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat told about her future at a meeting in a town hall in west Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, wants to be re-elected in November against Geoff Diehl, a Republican deputy who was co-chair of Trump’s campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She has been the centerpiece of speculation that she may be fighting with Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in a town hall since Trump came to power.
A member asked her if she would be eligible for the presidency.
Warren replied that it would be time for women to go to Washington to restore our faulty government and that includes a woman at the top.
Arrest after shooting Wayde Sims from LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said Saturday that a suspect was arrested following the shooting of Wayde Sims, a basketball player at LSU on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, during an ET press conference at 11:00.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims got a shot in the head and died of the consequences," police commander Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde stepped forward to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson has been interviewed and has been known to have been present at the crime scene, possessing a firearm and having shot down Wayde Sims.
Simpson has been arrested and detained in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a 1.98-meter junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games and started last season in 10 games. He had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after Sebastian Vettel left him victory after team orders
When Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that team orders from Mercedes would play a role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from pole position and left Hamilton almost completely in the cold when he defended his position and Vettel invited his team-mate to attack.
Vettel entered the pit and let Hamilton ride in the crowd in the group's tail, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went into the pit a round later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton came up again after a wheel-on-wheel action that forced the Ferrari driver to release space on the inside after a double movement in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the last place and was seventh after the first round on his 21st birthday.
Afterwards, he was a long time leader of the race, because he remained in his tyre choice and micted on a quick finish, so he could pick Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
In the end, he went to the pits in the 44th round, where he could not increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, so Raikkonen became fourth.
It's a hard day because Valtteri did his best all weekend fantastic. He was a real gentleman and let me pass.
The team has done their best for places one and two,” Hamilton said.
That wasn't a good body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein during an election meeting on Saturday over the fact that she insisted she was not the source of Christine Blasey Ford’s leaked letter, in which Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh was accused of assault.
Speaking at an election meeting in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about Ford's testimony to the Senate Justice Commission, but rather made it clear that what happened in the Senate showed that people can be "common, unkind and unwise."
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful show that takes place in the Senate in the last few days, when you see the anger, when you are the people who are angry and common and common and unkind and unkind," he said.
"When you look at the press releases and the leaks and that they then say 'oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember that?
Dianne Feinstein, did you run?
You remember her answer-- you leaked the document-- 'Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't run."
Well, wait a minute.
We have leaked... No, we have not leaked,” he added, imitating the senator.
In July, the letter mentioning Kavanaugh’s allegations were sent to Feinstein by Ford and was leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that her office was the leak.
"I have not concealed Dr. Ford's allegations, I have not leaked her story," Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to do it confidentially and I treated it confidentially as she asked.”
But the president did not believe her denial and he commented on it during the meeting on Saturday night: “I’ll tell you something, that wasn’t a good body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but that was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing with his defense of the Supreme Court candidate, who is accused by three women of sexual misconduct, the president suggested that the Democrats used the accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back power, with all the necessary means.
You see the community, the indifference, they don’t care who they hurt, who they should drive on to take power and regain control,” the president said in a report by Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars vs Belfast Giants: 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars approved Friday's loss in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning the return game with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had names with two goals led by scores of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie took the home team long before Dwyer led the Giants again.
Francois Bouchard made the match for Dundee, before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two goals.
It was the third loss in the Elite League this season for the men of Adam Keefe, who had to make a delay on Friday night to then beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast.
It was the fourth time this season that the two teams met, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 p.m. on an assist from Kendall McFaull. David Rutherford gave the assist that doubled Beauvillier's lead four minutes later.
In a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt gave the lead for Cownie's equaliser at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants took the lead in the first rest when he scored his second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team repackaged and Bouchard brought them back to the same level as a power-play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran then combined well to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game, late in the second period. He secured the victory with the fifth goal for his team, halfway through the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are playing home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies while ensuring that hundreds of people can escape the earthquake in an airplane
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is honored as a hero after he died because he ensured that a plane with hundreds of people could board safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are still missing after a severe earthquake hit the island of Celebes on Friday; an earthquake that subsequently caused a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks still haunt the area and many are buried below the point in the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that his colleagues fled for their lives, the 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wildly moving traffic tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He remained to ensure that flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was ready at the time on the runway, could take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the traffic tower when he thought it was crashing.
He later died in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News reported from Australia.
We had arranged a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning, before the helicopter had reached Palu.
“It breaks your heart when you hear it,” he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the death toll could rise to thousands and told the country’s disaster control agency that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is restricted.
"People are assuming that the death toll is still rising because many bodies were under the rubble and have not yet been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves that reached a height of six meters have destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral ceremony will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute bodies are brought in by ambulances.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are plundered everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is involved in a race to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the military: "I call on all of you to work day and night so that all the tasks necessary for the evacuation are completed.
Are you ready?" reported CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Airplane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says a man is missing after a crash in the lagoon
The airline carrying out the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says another man is missing after it had previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew members had safely left the plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a single male passenger would be missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to questions for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the rest of the passengers and crew after the plane was hit by water during landing at the Chuuke Islands airport.
Authorities said Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that everyone's condition was stable.
What caused the crash and what is the exact order of the events remains unclear for the time being.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both say the plane landed in the lagoon and missed the landing track.
Some witnesses believe the plane was shot over the landing track.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane was approaching the airport very low.
"That's good news," Jaynes said.
Jaynes told me that he and a few others managed to get into it through the water, which came to their center, wading to the emergency exits of the crashing plane.
He also said the stewardesses were in panic and screaming and that he had a non-serious head injury.
The U.S. Navy announced that sailors who were working on a shipyard nearby also helped rescue by bringing people to shore with an inflatable boat, before the plane sank further in about 30 meters deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that over the past 20 years, 111 people have been killed in crashes of airline companies registered with the PNG, but none of them relate to Air Niugini.
Analyst records the timeline of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor closed his requisition on Friday in the reopening trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, gave a several-hour testimonial as a witness expert in the field of information analysis.
He made it clear to the jury how he had used the cell phone data to record the movements of the 29-year-old suspect, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he had received the location data from various mobile phones that showed Tellis was at Chambers on the night of her death, which contradicted his earlier claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went back to Sanford.
Sanford stood at the witness's desk on Saturday and told me he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he told him he was at Sanford in his truck that night, Sanford said he was "flying because my truck was in Nashville at the time."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis had told him he knew Chambers about two weeks after she died.
The mobile phone data indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis knew some time after Chambers' death the texts, calls and contact details of his phone.
"He knew her from his life," said Hale.
The defense begins on Sunday with the slot arguments.
The judge said he expects the jury to begin the hearings later that day.
The High Breed: What is 'conscious hip-hop'?
A hiphop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol argues that hip hop is alienated from the origins of political opinions and the accumulation of social problems.
They want to go back to the roots and make 'conscious hip hop' popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently had a revival in the UK by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
A New York-based young lady sues a couple in court for ‘racist’ text
A New York-based maid filed a divorce for discriminatory reasons after she received a wrongfully sent text in which the mother complained about 'again such a black'.
The couple denies being racist and calls the court case 'abusing'.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, showed her dismay when she discovered that the new girl, Giselle Maurice, turned out to be a black woman when she met her on her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEE WILL BE A WAR AGAIN," Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
According to the American newspaper The New York Post, the "easy" Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice when she realized her blindness, declaring that their former Afro-American lady had done bad work, and that she had therefore expected a Filipino.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for a working day and was then sent home by taxi.
Maurice now sues the couple in court to get a compensation of <0x24>350,-- per day for the 6 months for which she was hired to be interned with the family, though without a contract.
“I want to make them feel like you’re just not doing that,” Maurice told the New York Post last Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple sneaks in on the claim that she is racist by saying it was reasonable to fire Maurice after they were afraid, by insulting her, that they could no longer trust her.
"My wife sent her a message that she didn't want to send her.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," his husband Joel Plasco told the New York Post.
"But would you leave your children to someone who had offended you, even if it was by accident?
Your newborn baby?
"Get out of here."
On comparing the lawsuit to “depressing,” Plasco said that his wife expected a baby in two months and was “in a very difficult situation.”
"You're going to chase someone like that?
That’s not so sympathetic,” the investment banker added.
While the lawsuit is still ongoing, public opinion is quick to capitulate the couple on social media, where they are harassed for their behavior and reasoning.
Paddington publishers feared that the audience would not have much interest in a talking bear, reveals new unveiled letter
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the approval of the book, said of the letter: “It is difficult to get in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time, even before the first publication.
With what we know now about Paddington’s huge success, it’s very entertaining.”
She told her father, who, before he was inspired to write the children's book about a small toy bear, as a cameraman working at the British broadcaster BBC, was optimistic about whether his book would be rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was 'bitterly sweet' after the year.
About Paddington, which she describes as "a very prominent member of the family," she said her father was secretly proud of the ultimate success.
She said, "He was a quiet, humble man."
"But because Paddington was so vital to him, it almost seemed like a child's accomplishment; you're proud when you didn't do anything for it yourself.
I think he was about to experience Paddington's success.
Although Paddington was the creation of his own imagination, he was the bear himself for success.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone
Immediately after the landing, her daughter was taken to Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried to save her life in vain.
"Nad had called several times to say it looked very bad and that she was expected not to get it," Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then Nad’s phone call came to say that she was going to die within two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
We'll be back together soon.
Then I'll be back with you.
The medications that the doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping slowly worked out and left her body.
She had died some time before, and this process turned everything off.
I could just sit there, knowing what was going on.
I couldn’t cry or cry, because I was sitting in the middle of all kinds of people and families.
I really had to keep myself big.”
Eventually, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, now saddened by the death of her daughter, entered the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea what trials she had to endure.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“I sat down with my head and the tears kept coming.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I got an overwhelming feeling of compassion for Nad.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Roaring women paste messages on bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones by suicide are making a strong effort to stop others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys paste inspiring messages and phone numbers that can call people in need for help on a bridge in Wales
Mrs Davis, her son, Tyler, was 13 when he first became depressed and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
Ms. Davis, 45, living in Lydney, Gloucestershire, England, says her son was a promising chef with a contagious grin.
He was known for his smile.
It was always said that his smile illuminated every room.”
Yet he had already stopped working before his death because he was deep in the pit.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11 years old, found him after he stole himself from life.
Mrs Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that there will be a chain reaction."
Mrs. Davis made the cards to let people know that there are others where you can go and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't shut up - talk about it."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt somber or depressed or something," she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we saw a change in his attitude.
He was sitting on the ground on the first day of Christmas - when the kids unpacked their presents, he didn't look at them at all."
She said that his death was a great trauma for them, but that they had to process it: 'It's tearing the whole family apart.
It's driving us apart.
But we all have to go on and continue to fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain as FBI investigation begins
"I thought that if we could really get for each other what he asks for; an investigation limited in time and scope, we might be able to create a little more unity again," Mr Flake said last Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee was 'detached from each other'.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to set up an investigation?
Their reluctance has everything to do with timing.
The interim elections are already in five weeks, on 6 November, and if, as expected, the Republicans are doing badly, their attempts to get their husband elected to the highest court in the country, are seriously hampered.
George W. Bush has already called members of the U.S. Senate to lobby for Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House, and thus his wife Ashley met, who Bush was his personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI has completed the report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, with 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sitting.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can count on at least 50 votes in the Senate, and that would allow Mike Pence, vice president, to cast the decisive vote to confirm Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of overcrowdings 'lows' under Kim
According to a South Korean lawmaker, the number of North Korean overcrowders to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, which quotes data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, says there were 1,127 survivors last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park notes that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher penalties for traffickers are the main factors for the decline.
Pyongyang has not responded in public.
The vast majority of North Korean translators will eventually be offered South Korean nationality.
According to sources in Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled via China, which has the longest external border with North Korea and where it is easier to cross than in the heavily secured demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers the perpetrators to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often expels them with violence.
Relations between North and South, which are still formally capable of war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang, where talks were mainly about the ongoing negotiations on denuclearisation.
This meeting took place after the historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, where they agreed largely to work towards the nuclear dismantling of the Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the US of lack of progress in lifting US sanctions since then.
“Without faith in the United States’ actions, there is also a lack of confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances there is no first step of unilateral disarmament,” Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical' and finds him unable to serve in the Supreme Court
Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, named a candidate for judge in the U.S. Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical', and finds him incompetent to serve in the Supreme Court
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman were to behave like this, one would call her 'hysterical'," Pelosi said of her response to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Justice Commission on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied emotionally the allegations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very excited; he sometimes almost yelled and was especially upset when he told about his family and his high school time.
He also strongly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the charges against him "big and coordinated character murder", organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi stated that she felt that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he was not fit to serve the Supreme Court because he was full of prejudice against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and the way he talks about the Clintons and the Democrats,” Pelosi said.
Pelosi protested when she was asked if she would try to initiate an impeachment proceedings against Kavanaugh if he were to be appointed, and the Democrats would get the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I can say this about it; if he does not tell the truth in Congress, or against the FBI, he is not only unfit for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he serves now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District of Columbia Court of Appeals (usually abbreviated D.C.).
Pelosi added that she was concerned as a Democrat that Kavanaugh would go against the 'Affordable Care Act or Roe v Wade', which is known as a conservative court.
Kavanaugh circumvented questions about the review of certain decisions of the Supreme Court during the confirmation hearings.
“Don’t expect us to be cheering if there is now a hysterical, prejudiced person appointed to the Supreme Court,” Pelosi said.
Women just have to admit it.
It is a just tyranny of months and years of accumulated anger that passes, and she can only cry to get it out.
“We’re going to cry when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's weird, do you?"
She continued, "I was tremendously helped by a woman who was a leader somewhere and who told me she was going to cry when she got angry. She developed a method, where she was going to cry every time she got angry. To the one she spoke to, she said, 'You might think I'm sad because I'm, 'cause I'm.
I'm angry."
And then she just kept crying.
I just thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are partly permitted as an expression of anger, because crying is essentially incomprehensible.
One of my best-kept memories from an earlier job, in a men-dominated office, is when I had to cry terriblely because I was extremely angry. An older woman, a guy businesswoman who everyone was a little afraid of, grabbed me in my throat and dragged me into a staircase.
"Don't let them see you crying," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and are glad they got you in the closet.

In 1987, when Mr. Hart was involved in an extramarital affair aboard a boat called 'Monkey Business' (informally meaning 'cat kwaad' or 'appealing') and withdrew from the race, the deeply disappointed Mrs. Schroeder thought there was no reason why she would not sing herself.
“It wasn’t a thoughtful decision,” she told me laughing 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone was talking about Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Because the campaign was already advanced, she was behind fundraising, so she solemnly promised not to participate if she could not raise <0x24>2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who would give men <0x24>1,000, wanted to give her only <0x24>250.
"Maybe they think I'm getting a discount?" she asked.
When she gave her speech in which she announced that she was not going to start a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings - of gratitude for the people who had supported her, of frustration because the system made it so hard to raise money, and to reach voters - instead of over-representing them, and of sexism.
"People will have thought I had a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder recalled about how the media reacted to her.
“They will have thought that Kleenex was my company sponsor.
I remember thinking, what would they put on my gravestone?
"She's crying?"
How the U.S.-China Trade War Could Benefit Beijing
The opening slogans of the U.S.-China trade war were overwhelming, and although the struggle has not been fought for a long time, a gap between the two countries could, according to experts, be a long-term favorable solution for Beijing.
Earlier this year, US President Donald Trump issued the first warning by raising taxes on major Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation was announced this week when new effective, increased tax rates were revealed for <0x24>200 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 billion) on goods; half of all goods coming from China to the US.
Beijing has taken repressive measures in nature every time, most recently by increasing tariffs from 5 to 10% for <0x24>60 billion in U.S. goods.
China has pledged to equalize the U.S. every time, and the world’s second-largest economy will probably not blink with its eyes quickly.
In order to bend Washington, requests must be allowed, but to bend publicly for the United States is far too painful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts claim that if Beijing is smart, the trade war with the U.S. could support China positively in the longer term, as the mutual dependence of the two economies declines.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would allow one of the two countries to come into a free economic fall is actually much more dangerous than viewers have previously acknowledged," said Abigail Grace, a research associate at the National Security Center.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, Foreign Minister Says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country that has been devastated by a seven-year war.
During his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem declared that the conditions in his country are improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists and to normalize the situation on the ground.
All the circumstances are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that threatened their daily lives and lives.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled their country since the war began in 2011.
It is estimated that there are still about six million people living in the country who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid in restoring the devastated country.
However, he stressed that Syria would not accept any conditional assistance or assistance from countries that had subsidized the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the '2018 Ryder Cup' by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 vs. 10.5 on the golf course 'Le Golf National' southwest of Paris in France.
The U.S. has now lost six consecutive times on European soil, and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title when the team of Danish leader Thomas Bjorn scored the required 14.5 points to defeat the United States.
American team star Phil Mickelson, who was wrestling almost the entire tournament, allowed his long shot from the tea into the water at par 3, hole 16, and admitted his loss to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, excelled in all his rounds and became one of the four players who ever scored 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current form in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was kicked out by the European team's lowest scorer, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, playing 5 holes down and 4 holes.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 holes down and 1 hole to play Ian Poulter from Britain, who may have played his last game in the Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran Segrio Garcia, with eight Ryder Cups, became the best European player of all tournaments ever with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't cry so fast, but today I can't do anything about it.
It's been a difficult year.
I am so grateful to Thomas that he selected me and believed in me.
I'm so glad we got the cup back.
It’s about the team, and I’m happy to be able to help,” an excited Garcia said after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot, John Ram, who beat the American legend Tiger Woods with 2 holes down and 1 hole in the game for singles on Sunday.
"The enormous pride I feel for defeating Tiger Woods, and I have always followed that guy when I grew up," Rahm, 23, said in a statement.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
Strange statistics of one of the greatest players ever; winner of 14 major championships, second only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled to find the fairways over the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at a high level throughout the tournament.
The American leader, Jim Furyk, said after his team's disappointing performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they've fought.
We have made Europe a little more difficult for a short time this morning.
We opposed it.
All respect for Thomas.
He's a great leader.
All 12 players in his team played very well.
We're going to regroup. I'm going to work with the American PGA (Professional Golfers' Association) and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're looking forward.
I love these 12 guys and I am proud to be their leader.
You have to take off your hat for the opponent.
We're overplayed."
