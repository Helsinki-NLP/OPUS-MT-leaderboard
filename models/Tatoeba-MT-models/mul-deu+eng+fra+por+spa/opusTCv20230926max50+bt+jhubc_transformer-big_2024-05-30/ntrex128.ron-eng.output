Members of the National Assembly of the Country of Galles are concerned that they may give the impression that they are “puppets”
Several members of the National Assembly of the Country of Galles are shocked because they have been suggested to change their title, namely to be called MWP (members of the Parliament of the Country of Galles).
This problem was caused by plans to change the name of the assembly in the Galician Parliament.
Members of the National Assembly of Galicia present on the political scene fear that this would cause ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party in the National Assembly of the Land of Wales is concerned that he is “tiring with Twp and Pwp”.
For readers outside of Wales: in Galician, "twp" means "obtus" and "pwp" means "fecal matter".
A member of the Galician Party of the National Assembly of the Galician Country stated that, overall, the group was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A Conservative Party member said the group had an "open" attitude towards the name change, but also noted that "MWP" resembles "Muppet".
In this context, the letter "w" is pronounced in Wales as well as the letter "u" in English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently preparing the legislation to introduce the name change, stated: “The final decision on how the members of the Assembly are appointed will certainly depend on their own members.”
The 2017 Law on the Government of Wales gave the Assembly the opportunity to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which revealed that many of them want to use the "Parliament of the Country of Galles".
With regard to the title of members of the National Assembly in Wales, the Commission preferred "Members of the Parliament in Wales" or "WMP", but the "MWP" option received the most votes in the public consultation.
Members of the National Assembly of Wales have apparently suggested alternative options, but attempting to reach a consensus could give a head start to Elin Jones, the chairman of the governing committee, who is expected to submit the bill on the amendments pending.
The reform legislation will include other changes in the way the meeting operates, including the rules on disqualification of members and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly shall have the last word concerning their title when the law is to be debated.
Macedonians Vote for Referendum on Change of Country Name
On Sunday, citizens with the right to vote will express their views on changing their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was organized to resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, the neighboring country, which has its own province called Macedonia.
The government of Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia's accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a vehement opponent of the name change plebiscite, said he would not take this vote into account.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is only a compromise that will allow them to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Episcopal Church have stopped beating as a result of the problems the churches in Harlem face.
“Historically, the veterans of the place I was talking to told me that before, you had found a bar and a church at every corner of the street,” Adams said.
“Today, there are no bars or churches anymore.”
He also said that the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
“People are socializing differently today,” he said.
“Bars no longer have the role of living room for the whole neighborhood, where people usually gather.”
And as for the churches, it is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of the goods will be spent faster than expected by the leaders and that, “sooner or later, the disappointment will be the same.”
He added that the churches could be replaced by residential buildings with condominiums full of people who would not support the remaining shrines of the neighborhood.
"The overwhelming majority of people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be white," he said, "so this will accelerate the closure of churches, because it is unlikely that many of the people who move into these condominiums will become members of those churches."
Both churches were built by congregations of white people before Harlem became a metropolis of African-American people – the St. Martin Metropolitan Community in 1870, a decade ago.
The original Methodist Congregation, made up of white people, moved from that area after 1930.
A congregation of African-Americans, who are conducting their religious activities nearby, took over the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by an African-American congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who boycotted merchants on 125th Street, a major street for Harlem shopping, who opposed hiring or promoting African-American people.
A fire that took place in 1939 severely affected the building, but Johnson's grandparents made plans to rebuild it and included the carillon in it.
Reverend David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor to St. Martin's Church, called the carillon "the bells of the poor."
The expert who commissioned the carillon in July described it differently: “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument”.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also stated that he was the first carillon in the world operated by an African-American musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger carillon at the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said it wasn't replaced at St. Martin.
What has been heard from St. Martin in recent months has been a complicated story, which included architects and contractors, some brought by church deacons, others from the diocese.
The sacristy, the governing body of the parish, made up of deacons, wrote to the diocese in July to complain that the diocese "will seek to pass costs" to the sacristy, even if it has not been involved in the engagement of architects and contractors of the dioceses.
Some of the honorables complained about the lack of transparency that the diocese proved.
A shark wounds a 13-year-old child trying to catch homies in California
According to authorities, on Saturday, a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old child while he was swimming trying to catch homies in California on the opening day of the homie season.
The attack took place around 7 a.m., near the Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been swimming for about half an hour with his friends on Saturday morning when he heard a boy screaming for help and then moved along with a group that helped him out.
Hammel also said that at first he thought the boy was happy that he had caught a hound, but then realized that he shouted, “He bit me!
He bit me!"
The whole clavicular was broken, Hammel said he noticed when he reached the boy.
“I called out to all those who were in the water and told them to come out of the water, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Radi Children's Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The species of the shark responsible for the attack is not known.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, said at a news conference that a shark was observed in the area a few weeks ago, but it was concluded that it is not a shark species that poses a danger.
Giles added that the victim suffered trauma in the upper part of the trunk.
Authorities have restricted access from Ponto beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigations and safety reasons .
Giles also mentioned that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but many of them are not considered dangerous.
Retailer Sainsbury plans to strengthen its position on the UK’s beauty and fashion market
Sainsbury takes over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, providing rays with beauty products in the style of a universal store, with specialized sales assistants.
As part of a consolidation of position on the UK's beauty products market, worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion, which will continue to grow, although sales of domestic products and in the fashion sector will not be tailor-made if the larger rays of the 11-year-old beauty products will be tested in stock.
Investment in the beauty industry comes in the context where supermarkets are looking for a way to use the former space for televisions, microwaves and household products.
Retailers at Sainsbury said the number of beauty products it offers will double, reaching up to 3,000 products, including, for the first time, brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing games, such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, will also receive more space, with marked areas similar to those in Boots stores.
The supermarket also relaunches its range of makeup products, Boutique, which means that most of the products are intended for vegan people, an increasingly popular demand among young buyers.
In addition, the products of the French retailer The Fragrance Shop will be included in two stores in the Sainsbury chain for testing purposes, the first being opened last week in Croydon, south of London, and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, in the second part of this year.
Online shopping and the tendency to buy smaller amounts of food every day from the nearest grocery store means that supermarkets need to find new ways to motivate people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, executive director of retailer Sainsbury, said outlets will increasingly look like universal stores as supermarket chains try to cope with the big discount stores, Aldi and Lidl, which offer more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury has included products from the Argos outlet in hundreds of stores, as well as Habitats, since it bought both chains two years ago, which means it has recorded increases in food sales as well as increased profits.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to refresh its pharmaceutical and beauty compartments has failed.
Sainsbury tried to merge with Boots in the early 2000s, but negotiations ceased after a divergence over how Boots store revenues were shared in its supermarkets.
The new strategy was designed after Sainsbury sold its 281-store pharmaceutical business to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
This means that Lloyds will play an important role in the plan, adding an extensive range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury Retailer, said: “We have transformed the look of our rays with beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized training of our colleagues, who will be at your disposal to give you advice.
Our range of brands can be adapted to all needs, and the attractive environment and convenient locations make us an extraordinary location to buy beauty products, revolutionizing the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones is angry after Holly Willoughby retired from an 11-million-pound contract
"Dragons' Den" star Peter Jones is angry after TV presenter Holly Willoughby resigned from a <0xC2><0xA3>11m contract with his lifestyle company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby does not have time to get involved in their project regarding the True brand, which includes accessories and household items.
The couple's company was compared to the Goop brand owned by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old host of “This Morning” announced on Instagram that she would retire.
Holly Willoughby sparked the rage of Peter Jones, the protagonist of the "Dragons' Den" show, retreating at the last minute from their lifestyle service business to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was angry when one of the most loved people on television acknowledged Tuesday, during a tense session at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts included up to 1.5 million pounds of oil and their new contracts, which allowed them to use more than <0xC2><0xA3>1.0 million.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and nearly doubled Willoughby's fortune, worth an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
After Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he would quit his contract for Truely, Jones left the UK to take refuge in one of his holiday homes.
A source said: “Truly was by far one of Holly’s priorities.
It would have been her long-term future for the next two decades.
The decision to step down shocked everyone.
No one came to believe what happened on Tuesday, it was just a little before the launch.
There is a warehouse full of products at the Marlow headquarters that are ready to be sold."
Experts believe the withdrawal of the show’s “This Morning,” which is among the UK’s best-selling stars, could cost the company millions as a result of investments in products such as pillows and candles, clothing and household items, as well as possible delays in delays.
It can also be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and Dan Baldwin, her husband, have been friends for ten years with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby laid the foundations of the brand Truely together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined them as director in March.
Couples spend their holidays together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin’s TV production company.
Willoughby will become M&S ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV's "I'm A Celebrity" show.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We don’t want to comment on his business.”
I was very hard, and then "we fell in love"
He made jokes about the critics he will receive from journalists because he made a comment that some would consider “a president’s contempt” and that he has such a positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump take such a big step back?
Trump said imitating a voice of “news presenter.”
“I didn’t take a step back.”
He said Kim was interested in having another meeting after the initial meeting in Singapore in June was described by Trump as a huge step towards North Korea’s denuclearization.
However, negotiations on denuclearization have ceased.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told leaders around the world at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not notice a “correct response” from the United States to the North’s US counter-attack with the United States.
Instead, he noted that the United States continues to issue sanctions to put pressure on this.
Trump had a more optimistic view in his motivational speech.
“Everything is going well with regard to North Korea,” he said.
"I wish we were headed for a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a great relationship.”
He also said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results: stopping missile tests, support for the release of hostages, and the return of the US military.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to behave like a president, but if I were to behave like this, instead of the 10,000 people out there trying to get into this relentless arena, it would be around 200 people,” Trump said, pointing out to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island, killing hundreds of people
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok’s population was displaced, it was not declared a national disaster, a necessary condition for initiating international aid actions.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, it was very clear that I did not ask for international assistance, so it is a rather difficult situation," he said.
Although the “Save the Children” Foundation tries to form a team that travels to Palu, it is not yet known whether foreign personnel are allowed access to the site.
Sutopo, the spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian authorities are evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can contribute to the relief efforts.
Given Indonesia’s constant earthquakes, it is unbelievable that the country continues to be inadequately prepared for the anger of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not very often found on other coasts.
The lack of a warning siren in the event of a tsunami in Palu, although a warning has been issued in this regard, may have contributed to the loss of life.
Even in the best of circumstances, travelling between the islands of Indonesia proves to be a challenge.
Natural disasters complicate this even more.
A ship-hospital stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site where the new disaster occurred.
President Joko Widodo proposed that the improvement of Indonesia’s defence infrastructure be the focal point of his election campaign, and has spent money on roads and railroads.
But the lack of funds has affected the Joko administration, which will participate next year in a new election campaign.
Joko also faces persistent pressure from Indonesian sects because members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as gangs of Christians and Muslims clashed on the streets, using masts, arrows and arrows, as well as other rudimentary weapons.
Video: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge gives the saver's goal and equals the score in the match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at London’s Stamford Bridge football stadium.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri, while he was about 30 yards from the opponent's goal, and his team was led by Chelsea by 1-0.
He hit the ball and sent it to the left before giving a shot in the direction of the goal.
The monkey reached the top of which, heading towards the upper right corner of the gate.
Eventually, the ball passed by Kepa Arrizabalaga who jumped to it and fell into the gate.
“I just had to try to get to the ideal position, get the ball, and players like Shaq are always trying to move forward as much as possible, so I tried to get as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and it was enough, I didn't think much about it, I just took the ball further."
Chelsea took a 1-0 break after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The blue team attacker sent the ball to Mateo Kovacic, then returned to the middle of the field and ran to the Liverpool team's half-field.
Kovacic made a quick one-two move in the middle of the field.
Then he sent the ball to Hazard, who went into it.
Hazard surpassed the defense and sent the ball into the net, hitting it with his left foot and passing by Liverpool's Alison Becker.
Liverpool will have a match against Naples in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday, at 15:00, at Stadio Sao Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3:00 p.m. in London.
The number of deaths caused by the tsunami in Indonesia reaches 832
The number of deaths caused by the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia reached 832, according to the national disaster agency, on Sunday morning.
Several people were captured under the ruins of buildings collapsed by the 7.5 magnitude quake that took place on Friday and triggered waves of up to 6 meters, the agency's spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has a population of over 380,000 people, was covered by the remains caused by the collapse of the buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of killing a woman by biting
A murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m., with wounds caused by beatings, at Grayson Mews, John Street, and a man suspected of murder was arrested.
Police have asked people in the area who have heard or seen something on the subject to come to the statements section.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I appeal to all people who were near John Street in Birkenhead and who heard or saw something suspicious contact us.
I also want to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who have recorded any useful materials with the help of the on-board camera, to contact us if they have essential information for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the body belonged to a woman in Birkenhead and was found on a property.
This afternoon, a few people who think they know the woman came to the scene to ask questions about where she was found in the morning.
Investigations are underway, and police said they were trying to inform the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews tried to return to his apartment, but police told him that no one was allowed to enter the building.
He was shocked when he found out what happened.
People living in the building were told it would take a few hours before they were allowed to enter.
A police officer told a person that the entire area is now considered the scene of the crime.
On the spot, a woman appeared in tears.
He repeats, “It’s so horrible!”
At 2:00 p.m., two police ducks were on the perimeter and another was outside.
A few police officers were on the perimeter, monitoring the block of apartments.
Any person with information is asked to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC police, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and mention case 247 from September 30.
Cromwell's statue of Parliament becomes the most recent commemorative monument affected by alterations on "rewriting history"
Its removal would represent a poetic justice for the destruction in the Taliban-style of so many cultural and religious artifacts of England, carried out by his fanatical Puritan descendants.
Cromwell described Jeremy Crick’s suggestion as “a madness” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the present debate about the removal of statues as Oliver Cromwell’s figure from outside Westminster Palace to become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither commanded nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps he would sacrifice a wrong Cromwell for the actions of his ancestor Thomas of the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many believe is worth celebrating.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the nineteenth century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether it is an exact representation, this is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
But certainly, the conflict of the mid-17th century led to the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable individual figure, which is part of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and commemorating."
Pig Causes China Farmer's Death
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local news agencies.
The man, identified only by the surname "Yuan", was found dead after his artery was cut off and was covered in blood near a pig farm in Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, according to the Sunday Morning Post publisher in South China.
A pig farmer was preparing to inject pig vaccines at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He apparently came with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a neighboring cottage was open.
He said there was a large male pig with blood in his mouth.
Legislative doctors confirmed that a pig of about 300 kg caused the farmer's death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were full of blood and broken," his cousin, whose surname is "Wu", told Guiyang Evening News.
Surveillance cameras recorded Yuan entering the market Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
About an hour later, her body was found.
The animal that caused the man’s death did not belong to Yuan, nor to his cousin.
A representative of the market told Evening News that the pig was shut down to prevent him from attacking someone else, while police collected evidence from the scene.
Yuan's family and authorities seem to be negotiating compensation for his death.
Although they are rare, cases of pigs that have attacked people have been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their Massachusetts farm, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years ago, due to a 300-pound pig, a Galician man was trapped in his tractor until his wife came to scare and lay down the animal.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood can trigger such reactions.
“It’s just playing.
They like to bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them proper respect,” he said.
Hurricane Rosa, which has lost intensity, will cause torrential rains in the southwest of the United States
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is losing intensity as it moves to cooler waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring rain that will cause flooding in northern Mexico and southwestern the United States in the coming days.
Rosa recorded wind conditions at a speed of 85 km/h, being a Category 1 hurricane on Sunday at 5 a.m. and was located about 600 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to arrive in the north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a depressing area over the Pacific Ocean began to form and is moving eastwards, towards the western coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula, Monday, in the form of a tropical storm, will begin to push the tropical humid north of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 25 cm of rainfall to some parts of Mexico.
Then, the tropical moisture that will interact with the depressed area will generate abundant rain in the southwest in the next days.
Locally, precipitation between 3 and 10 cm will cause dangerous rapid flooding, waste streams and, possibly, landslides in the desert.
Intensive tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates of up to 5 and 8 cm per hour in certain areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Precipitations are expected between 5 and 10 cm in the southwestern part, especially in most of Arizona.
It is possible that rapid flooding occurs due to the conditions of rapid deterioration due to the scattered character of the tropical rainfall.
It is not recommended to venture in the desert on foot, given the threat posed by tropical rain.
Heavy rains could turn canyons into violent rivers, and storms will bring local winds into rafts and dust.
The approaching depressive zone will bring torrential rains to the areas on the southern coast of California.
Precipitations of nearly 2 cm are possible, which could lead to smaller flows of waste and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall in the region in the wet season.
Dispersed tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona in the second part of Sunday and in the first part of Monday, before the rain spread more Monday evening and Tuesday.
The heavy rainfall will spread in the so-called “four corners” on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
In October, there will be intense temperature changes in the U.S. as the Arctic region will become colder, but the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes, this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
On Sunday, there are dramatic temperature differences in the central area of the United States.
There is a temperature difference of almost 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the extended heat of summer will try to form and expand again.
It is estimated that much of the central and eastern U.S. region will face a warm early October, with temperatures of up to 27 degrees in extensive areas, from the southern fields to certain parts of the northeast.
On Tuesday, New York City could reach 27 degrees, with about 4 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates high odds of above average temperatures for the eastern United States until the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people followed the press statement backed by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
At the same time, the political confrontation continued, with TV broadcasts interrupting Friday’s normal program for a last-hour news: an agreement signed between Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct an investigation of the charges for a week.
Ford said she is 100% sure that Kavanaugh harassed her while she was in a state of drunkenness and tried to disguise her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, as part of an intense testimony, said that it is 100% certain that this did not happen.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million people would have watched the hearing on Friday.
The company counted average viewing on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks that transmitted it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble computing people who visit from the office.
To put this in perspective, this audience is similar to that for a play-off football game or Academy Awards.
According to Nielsen, the Fox News Channel, whose opinion hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, was in front of all the channels, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the daily audience.
ABC ranked second, with a viewership of 3.26 million.
According to Nielsen, CBS was followed by 3.1 million people, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
Interest remained at a high level after the hearing.
Flake was at the center of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning as protesters shouted at him and he was trying to climb into an elevator at a meeting of the Judiciary Committee.
He looked down for a few minutes while people were arguing with him, and everything was broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m right here in front of you,” said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling us the truth?
He was told, “You have power, while so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before closing the elevator, that he would have more to say at the committee meeting.
Televisions later broadcast the vote in the Judicial Committee to advance Kavanaugh's nomination for a vote by the Senate.
But Flake said he would only do this if the FBI agreed to review the charges against the nominee next week, which is demanded by minority democracies.
Flake was largely convinced by the conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake's decision came after a conversation with the Coons and several senators thereafter.
Flake's choice was important, as it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes needed to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Accuses Critics of 'Political Gaming' on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of her plans to leave the European Union of “political games” with Britain’s future and undermine national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, attended the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview next to his photo on the front page of the newspaper, former Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued an attack on its Brexit plan, the so-called Chequers plan, saying that the proposal was that Britain and the European Union would “return tariffs.”
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson, Suspected of Killing LSU Player
Police have arrested a suspect in the murder of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned on charges of second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge police department.
Authorities have released a video of the Sims and Simpsons clash, and police said the Sims lost their glasses during the clash.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to WAFB, affiliated with CBS.
After Simpson's interrogation, police say he admitted he shot Wayde deadly.
His bail was set at <0x24>350,000, according to the lawyer.
The Baton Rouge Legal Medicine Bureau published a preliminary report Friday, saying the death was caused by a shot in the head through the neck.
The department credits the Louisiana police force, the state police criminal lab, the Southern University police and the citizens in the area for the assistance provided in the investigation, which led to the arrest in question.
LSU’s athletic director, Joe Alleva, thanked the police for “diligence and the search for justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98-metre-high attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
Last season, he scored an average of 5.6 points and had 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball team coach Will Wade said the team was "devastated" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“This worries me all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano threw a column of ash over Mexico City
The ash from the Popocatepetl volcano arrived in the southern neighborhoods of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexican citizens on Saturday to keep their distance from the volcano after activity in the crater was triggered and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center monitors several hurricanes and vibrations.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on car windows in Mexico City neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in volcanic activity 72 kilometres southeast of the capital, after a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as “Don Goyo” has been active since 1994.
Relationship between Catalan police and separatists before the anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with the gendarmes on the first anniversary of the vote for secession of Catalonia, gathering thousands of opposition protesters.
A group of masked pro-separatists held away from gendarmes bombed those with eggs and powder paint, creating dark dust clouds on the streets that were usually flooded by tourists.
The torture was intensified later, with police using their sticks to control the situation.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted “We don’t forget, we don’t forgive,” while Unionist protesters shouted “Live Spain!”
14 people received medical care for minor injuries caused during the protests, according to the local press.
Tensions remain at a high level in the region that wants to become independent one year after the October 1 referendum was considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters voted, by an overwhelming majority, to become independent, although voting participation was low, and those against the secession boycotted largely the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 100 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations in the region, with violent harassment taking place.
Pro-independence groups camped overnight on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but the protesters were forced to choose a new path.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he had no hopes of gaining independence from Catalonia.
“Last year I had some of the most beautiful moments in my life.
I looked at my parents crying joyously that they could vote, but now we have nothing more to do,” he said.
Despite achieving a vital but tight victory, in the regional elections in December last year, the Catalan pro-independent parties tried to keep pace this year, many of the most well-known leaders being either in exile or in detention.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of police on his phone, said politicians on both sides had fueled the conflict.
“The situation is getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders incarcerated since the end of last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
“As a candidate for the European elections, it is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Several men have been arrested after entering a house by car
Three men, aged 33, 34, and 39, were arrested after a car crashed into a Londonderry house several times.
The incident took place on Thursday, around 7:30 p.m., in Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was caused to the gates and even the building.
Apparently, at one point, an arrow was used against the car.
Menga's shot helped the Livingston team win 1-0 against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livingston left the Rangers unresponsive, Steven Gerrard reaching his second defeat in 18 games, as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's hit proved to make a difference while Gary Holt's team played at the same level as Hibernian in the second round.
Gerrard's team are left without a win in the Premier League this season and face the Hearts leaders with eight points behind them next Sunday.
Earlier, the Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston remains unbeaten in the division for up to six games, Holt's main coach still feels the taste of defeat, as he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses his chance against crude visitors
Holt's team should've gone a long way before signing up, and their orientation has caused all sorts of trouble for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to penetrate and tried to hit the gate space, then Alan Lithgow managed to hit wide after sliding in to intercept the ball sent with Craig Halkett's head.
The hosts were pleased to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that it could cause trouble for visitors at the free kicks.
And that’s how the crucial gap came about.
The Rangers accepted a free kick, and Livingston managed an opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaborating to pass to Menga, who shot and scored from the center of which.
At that stage, the Rangers dominated the possession, but faced the host's impenetrable defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was no longer greatly disturbed in the rest of the game.
This model of the game continued in the second round, although Alfredo Morelos forced a defense from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was unsuccessful against Rangers Allan McGregor, and Lithgow hit another Livingston player.
Diagonal passes continued to come in the Livingston team, but unsuccessfully, and the two penalties - after Halkett abruptly beat Glenn Middleton and after a henchman - were not accepted.
“Fenomenal game” offered by Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were excellent, without exception, continuing to exceed expectations on an upward trajectory.
Their style of play and the team have not changed at all since their return to the top, but the merits must be given to Holt for the way he has trained his team since he took over.
He had so many models to follow.
Captain Halkett was great, with an excellent organized defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in trouble throughout the game.
But the Rangers weren’t too inspired.
Although they have had good performance since being driven by Gerrard, they have not reached the same standards.
The goal passes were unsuccessful, they managed once to catch the opponents' free doors, and this should be an alarm signal for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the ranking.
Mixed reactions to Erdogan's visit to Cologne
It was all pink Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin to have breakfast.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at remediating relations between NATO allies.
They are dissatisfied with issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
In this context, Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new huge mosque.
The city hosts the largest number of Turkish citizens in the world, outside of Turkey.
Police invoked security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but enough supporters gathered nearby to see the president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, mostly Kurds, have made their voices heard, condemning Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him with open arms in the country.
The conflicting protests reflect the split about a visitor considered a hero by some of the Turks in Germany and an autograph by others.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies after collision with a car
A cyclist died in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a crowded street in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 a.m.
The driver stopped, and the paramedics showed up at the scene of the accident, but the man died on the spot.
The accident comes just a few months after another cyclist died in an accident that took place on Childers Street, where the driver escaped from the scene, which is about a mile from where the accident took place on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said the officers were trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Access is restricted in the area, the bus route is diverted, and motorcyclists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Injured in a Clash
Six prison officers were wounded following a harassment in a high-security prison for men, a prison official said.
On Sunday, a shutdown was triggered at HMP Long Martin in Worcestershire at around 9:30 a.m., which is ongoing.
Specialized officers were brought to deal with the detention, in which eight detainees are involved, isolated in a wing.
Officers were treated on-site for minor injuries to the face.
A prison spokesman said: “The specialised prison staff were requested to handle an incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six members of the staff received medical care after they were injured.
“We don’t tolerate violence in our prisons and we have very clear rules with respect to those responsible, who will be transferred to the police and could spend a longer period of time after the arrest.”
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 detainees, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison governor needed hospital treatment after being attacked by a detainee.
And last year, in October, officers dealing with the riots were called to prison to deal with a very serious situation, with staff being attacked with billiard balls.
Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City are in danger of being flooded due to Hurricane Pink (dry areas can benefit from this)
A tropical depression is rarely occurring in Arizona, but this is quite likely to happen at the beginning of next week, as Hurricane Rosa’s remaining energy resources will be used in the southwestern desert, presenting a risk of rapid flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued rapid flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to have a direct trajectory to Phoenix on Tuesday, and in the second part of Monday it will cause precipitation.
The National Meteorological Service of Phoenix announced in a tweet that “only ten tropical cyclones have maintained a state of storm or tropical depression at a distance of about 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was an action hurricane about 60 km away from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict precipitation of between 5 and 10 cm, with isolated amounts of up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
In other areas of the southwest desert, including in the centre of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, amounts ranging from 3 to 5 cm will be recorded, with total amounts possible up to 10 cm in isolated areas.
For regions beyond the risk of rapid flooding, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing, given that the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, in some areas, torrential rain will be beneficial, as the southwest is facing drought problems.
According to the U.S. Dry Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona is facing at least a severe drought, the second largest category, according to weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will lead to landslides in Mexico’s Baja California Peninsula.
Rosa, which still had hurricane power on Sunday morning, with winds up to 136 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north at 19 km/h.
The storm will meet colder waters in the Pacific and will therefore decrease.
Thus, it is expected to produce ground slides in Mexico, with a tropical storm power in the afternoon or Monday evening.
The torrential rains in Mexico could be significant, presenting a high risk of flooding.
"Torrental rains are expected between 8 and 10 cm" from Baja California to northwest Sonora, and can reach 25 cm," according to weather.com.
Then, Rosa will head north in Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday morning, as a tropical depression, passing through Arizona and reaching southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main danger posed by Rosa or her remains is the extreme torrential rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the desert in the southwestern United States," a representative of the National Hurricane Center said.
It is expected that these rains will produce sudden flooding, which will endanger people’s lives, and bring waste streams to deserts, as well as landslides to mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four People Arrested for Attempt to Kill
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old person was found wounded by beatings in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at about 4:00 p.m.
He was taken to the hospital, where he is in stable condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old boy were arrested last night in the Radstock area, according to police in Avon and Somerset.
Officers have asked for the help of citizens who might have material on their mobile phones to present themselves to the police department.
Trump Says Kavanaugh Faced “Dissatisfaction and Anger” From Democratic Party
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote of rejection of the Democratic Party’s ruthless and scandalous tactics,” Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had faced “discontent and anger” with the Democratic Party during his nomination.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh testified before Congress, vehemently denying Christine Blasey Ford’s claims of sexually harassing her ten years ago when she was a teenager.
Ford also testified at the hearing about her affirmation.
The president said on Saturday that “the American people saw on that day Kavanaugh’s genius, quality and courage.”
“A confirmation vote by Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation vote for one of the best minds in this generation’s legal field,” he told the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination while talking about the importance of the Republican presence in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
I’m not a candidate, but somehow I’m a candidate,” he said.
“For this reason, I am expressing my whole positive opinion about the candidates that I consider to be great.”
Trump said Democrats are on a mission to “resist and obstruct.”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate since Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place by Friday, an assistant to the GOP leadership told CNN.
Hundreds of people killed by earthquake in Indonesia, the number is increasing
At least 384 people were killed, many of them being taken by huge waves that hit the beaches when a strong earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia's island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when six-meter-high waves hit the beach in the swamp, people being taken from the water and destroying everything in their way.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5-degree earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat was issued yesterday, people were still seeing their activities on the beach and did not immediately run, becoming victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the BNPB disaster mitigation agency, told a press conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami brought with it cars, bushes, houses, hitting everything on the ground,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
He added that some people had to climb trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated in 24 centers in Palu.
The photos published by the disaster agency show several buildings and shops destroyed, bridges overturned and collapsed, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, replicas continued to haunt the city on the coast.
The quake was felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said the energy emitted by Friday’s heavy earthquake was about 200 times the power of the Hiroshima atomic bomb in World War II.
The geographical structure of the city, which lies at the end of a long and narrow bay, has probably intensified the magnitude of the tsunami, he added.
Nugroho described the damage as "extended" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the ruins of the collapsed buildings, he said, along with the 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and injuries could be greater along the 300-kilometre-long coast north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications were “completely disturbed, without any information” in Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said, adding that its staff and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
He added: “This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
On Saturday, the agency was sharply criticized for not informing that a tsunami would strike Palu, although authorities said the waves had arrived at the time of the warning.
In social media posts, you can hear a man on the upper floor of a building screaming frenetic warnings that the tsunami is approaching to the people on the adjacent street.
Within a few minutes, a water wall hits the shore, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the veracity of the material.
The quake and tsunami caused a major interruption of electricity, which blocked communications in Palu, making it difficult to coordinate the rescue efforts of the authorities.
The army began sending aid jets from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the evacuated people still need food and other basics.
The city’s airport has been reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned a visit to the evacuation centers in Palu for Sunday.
The number of deaths caused by the tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800.
The situation is extremely serious.
While Word Vision staff from Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees are housed in improvised shelters in the office courtyard, they passed by devastating scenes, Doseba said.
He added: “They told me they saw many houses destroyed.”
The situation is very serious.
Even though aid groups began to initiate disaster relief actions, some people complained that extensively skilled foreign workers were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, financial resources, supplies of materials and personnel can reach the site of a disaster only if it is declared a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“After the government says, ‘Yes, this is a national disaster,’ we can start international assistance actions, but nothing has been announced yet.”
After the second night of the Friday earthquake and tsunami in Palu, the friends and families of the missing hoped that their loved ones would be miraculously saved from such a national disaster.
On Saturday, a boy was pulled out of a canal.
On Sunday, rescue personnel released a woman who had been under the ruins for two days, with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the national parachute team, coached for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia, two of the missing parachute pilots.
Other people among the captives at the Roa Roa hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
“Given my experience in the field of parapanta, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon told how, a few hours after the news of the Roa Roa hotel collapse in the community of parachute sports practitioners, he sent desperate WhatsApp messages to competitors in Palu who participated in the festival on the beach.
But in the right of his messages there was only a gray beef, and not two blue beef.
“I think that means the messages weren’t sent,” he said.
A group of thieves stole <0x24>26,750 while feeding a Newport on the Levee ATM
On Friday morning, thieves stole the sum of <0x24>26,750 from a Brink employee feeding an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
The car driver emptied a ATM from the entertainment complex and was preparing to carry more money, Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, another man “flew behind Brink’s back” and stole a bag of money that had to be transported.
According to the statement, witnesses observed several suspects who fled the site, but the police did not mention the number of people involved in the incident.
Any person who has information about their identity is requested to contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes stage name to “Ye”
Kanye West changed his stage name to “Ye”.
On Saturday, he announced the change on Twitter: “The individual officially known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has been called "Ye" for some time and uses this title as the title of the eighth album, released in June.
This change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
It comes to the show in place of singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled “for reasons of an emotional nature,” the show’s producer said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of the current stage name, West previously stated that this word also has a religious significance to him.
"I think 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year, as part of a discussion about the title of the album with the radio host Big Boy.
“So I’m you, I’m us, it’s about us.
It all started with "Kanye", which means the only one, and it came to "Ye", which is a reflection of our good, evil, unclear, and the whole.
The album is more a reflection of what we are as people.”
He is one of several rappers who have chosen to change their stage name.
Sean Combs had countless stage names, Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the name Love and Brother Love.
And a former West collaborator, JAY-Z, changed his name, sometimes in cramped, sometimes without, as well as in capital letters.
President of Mexico pledges not to use military force against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed that he will never use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza that he "will never use the army to repress the Mexican people."
The troops fired at a peaceful market demonstration on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when the left-wing movements of students were rooted in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador is committed to supporting young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are attracting young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its funding for AI
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in the field, says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and user of artificial intelligence, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after more and more members of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even if there is no official AI strategy in the U.S..
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: it aims to be first in terms of AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all the other countries are far behind the U.S. and that we are looking for the next AI discovery,” Lee said.
The doubling of funds could double the chances that the next major AI achievement will be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "Superpowers of AI: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China's leading companies, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that defeated American player Othello, who was the best in the field at the time, and later became CEO of Microsoft Research and chairman of the Google subsidiary in China.
Lee appreciated previous competitions from U.S. governments in the field of technology, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when it would be the next one to help identify future visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government funds, Lee said.
“It’s not China that puts beams in the wheels of academic leaders, it’s the corporations,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired outstanding graduates from universities to work at AI in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could help the U.S. step up its AI efforts.
“I think that visas should be automatically offered to doctoral students in AI,” he said.
The State Council of China issued a New Generation of Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China provides financial support to people in academic institutions similar to the way in which the National Foundation for Science and other government organizations provide money for researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic activity is lower in China.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence to involve industry partners and academics, and the White House announced the formation of a Selection Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, the U.S. Army Research Institute (DARPA) announced a <0x24>2 billion investment for an initiative called “AI Next”.
Also at this time, the NSF is investing more than <0x24>100 million a year in AI research.
In the meantime, there have been no changes to U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians will vote in referendum if they want to change country name
On Sunday, Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum if they wished the country’s name changed to the “Republic of North Macedonia”, a change that would resolve a decade-old dispute with Greece, which opposed its accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which comprises a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the neighboring country represents a claim on its territory and opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but opposition nationalists argue that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia’s Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he will not vote in the referendum and that a boycott campaign has raised doubts as to the presence of the vote, and it is possible that the minimum 50% threshold needed to validate the referendum may not be reached.
The question on the ballot paper in the referendum will be: “Do you agree to join the EU and NATO, accepting the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is a price to be paid by Macedonia, one of the countries that resulted from the destruction of Yugoslavia, in order to be accepted in entities such as the EU and NATO.
“I am here today to vote for the future of the country, so that young Macedonians can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because this means safer lives for all of us,” said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, quite a few Members of Parliament said they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
In order for the name to be changed, a two-thirds quorum in parliament is required.
The state electoral commission said no irregularities were reported by 13:00.
However, participation was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of people with the right to vote submitted.
“I came to vote for my children and for our place in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter from Skopje, the country’s capital.
On September 30, 2018, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica, and their son, Dusko, voted for a referendum on Macedonia's name change, allowing it to join NATO and enter the European Union.
In front of the Skopje parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small scene and took seats in front of the high-ranking tents of those who would boycott the referendum.
“We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with the front up, not the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we are not wanted by the name of Macedonia, we can head to other countries, such as China and Russia, and we can become part of the Eurasian Union.”
Prime Minister Zaev said that joining NATO will bring the investments so necessary to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20%.
“I think the majority will be in favour of changing the name because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favor of NATO and EU membership,” Zaev said.
He said a result in favor of changing the name would be “confirming our future.”
According to a poll published last Monday by the Institute of Policy Research, between 30% and 43% of citizens with the right to vote will participate in the referendum, below the required number of participants.
According to another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70% said they would vote in favor of the change.
For the referendum to be valid, the voting attendance must be 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first major political blow to the pro-Western government since its takeover in May last year.
Video: Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero manages to pass Brighton’s entire defensive and score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling managed to pass Brighton's defensive and scored Manchester City's 2-0 win at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
It seemed to Aguero that it was incredibly easy for him to score in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker received a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the sequence.
He moved very quickly among three defensive players from Brighton, before reaching the free side of the field.
Then, Aguero woke up surrounded by four players of the opposing team.
He managed to pass a defender, and then overcame several opponents to the margin of which Brighton team.
After that, he gave a pass to the left, the ball reaching Sterling.
The English striker sent the ball back to Aguero, who hit the ball with his right foot, succeeding in avoiding Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with a kick to the right side of the goal.
"Aguero is facing a few legs problems," Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked to him and agreed to play for 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We’re lucky he scored a goal at the time.”
But Sterling is the one who got their initial advantage for the Azuri in the Premier League match.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got a deep pass on the Brighton team's territory at that stage.
Then he gave Leroy Sane a care on his left flank.
Sane dribbled the ball several times until he sent a pass to Sterling, who sent it in the direction of the gate.
The Azuri attacker hit the ball to the net just before heading out of the field.
Manchester City will face Hoffenheim in the group stage on Tuesday at 12:55 at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to make the ravages in the game against Rockies
With the national team eliminated from the play-off competition, there were not too many reasons to force another start.
But Scherzer, being extremely competitive, hopes to win Sunday's game against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still play-off implications for the Rockies, which have an advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
The Rockies got at least one unpredictable spot, with a 5-2 win against the national team on Friday night, but are still trying to keep their first division title.
"Even if we don't play for anything, at least we can enjoy the atmosphere here in Denver, with the crowd, and the other team would probably play at the highest level of any point I could face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete under these circumstances?”
The national team has not yet announced the player who will open the game on Sunday, but according to sources, it is inclined to allow Scherzer to strike first in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be at the opening beat of the 34th game, had a warm-up session on Thursday and will throw it into normal conditions on Sunday.
The Washington midfielder has a score of 18-7 and an ERA of 2.53 and 300 draws in 220 and 2/3 games this season.
Trump Expresses Support in West Virginia
The president referred to the situation regarding the Supreme Court's decision regarding Brett Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of the Republican presence in the midterm elections.
“All our efforts are at stake in November.
There are five weeks left until one of the most important choices in our lives.
“This is one of the big ones, I’m not a candidate, but I’m actually a candidate, so I’m trying to support good candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: “You see this horrific, radical group of Democrats, you see what’s happening right now.
And they are determined to take power again by using any necessary means, you can see their evilness.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to crush to gain power and control, that’s what they want, to have power and control, and we won’t give it.”
He also said Democrats are on a “resistance and obstruction” mission.
“And you can see this in the last four days,” he said, describing Democrats as “funny and bad, mean and lying.”
He referred to Senator Dianne Feinstein of the Democratic Party and is part of the Senate Judicial Committee, which has been severely evaded by the public.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you disclose the document?
Okay. Okay.
No. Hmm... I... wait a minute—that was the dumbest body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer tolerates people from a different point of view.
People who express their opinions are no longer tolerated.
It did not surprise me at all that Momentum activists in my local party supported the censorship motion with respect to me.
After all, I am just one of the members of the Labour Party in Parliament who was told that they are not welcome, just because we have expressed our opinion.
Joan Ryan, my colleague in Parliament, received a similar treatment because she was vehement about anti-Semitism.
As far as I am concerned, the censorship motion was a criticism to me for not agreeing with what Jeremy Corbyn said.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, similar issues, ironically, about which neither Jeremy had a common opinion with previous leaders.
The press release for the Labour Party’s Friday meeting in Nottingham East stated that “we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of the eight-year term as a Member of Parliament for the Labour Party, Friday evening GC meetings were like this.
Unfortunately, today, many meetings do not take place in this way, and the promise of a “better, slower” political environment has long been forgotten, if ever respected.
It has become increasingly evident that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged according to what is accepted by the leadership of the party.
Things have started to be like this since Jeremy became a leader, when I noticed that some colleagues with whom I had a common vision of politics began to expect to change my thinking and to agree with some things that I would not have agreed with before, or that the EU would have been one of those things.
Every time I speak in public, no matter what I say, there is a wave of de-socialization abuses that demand my removal from the party, denouncing central politics, saying that I should not be in the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only person who faces this.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than my colleagues, because comments about my person tend to be political in nature.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face sexual or racist abuse, but maintain their level of involvement in this regard.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that abuse has become a normal thing.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should adopt a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different views within the party, and with every motion to censor or change the rules of selection, the party becomes increasingly less flexible in this regard.
Many people have advised me in the last two years to put my head down, to stop being so vocal, and everything “will be fine” like this.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, when I was a student, motivated by the fact that the negligence of the Thatcher government led to the collapse of my class, I wanted to fight for improved public services for those who have the greatest need for them, with local ministers, or with local horsemen.
I have never concealed my political views, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can say that my views on politics and issues that I do not agree with in relation to the current leadership are vague.
To the people who supported Friday’s motion, I can only tell them that, in the context of the country heading for Brexit, which will affect our local households, businesses and services, I do not understand their desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But the only message I want to convey is not for the Momentum group in Nottingham, but for citizens, whether or not they are members of the Labour Party: I am proud to represent you and I promise you that no threat of elimination from your party or political opportunism will stop me from taking any higher decisions in my interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr football team reaches the top of the rankings
Despite the fact that two late attempts somehow influenced the final result, there is no doubt that Ayr deserves to win today’s highly interactive game in Tennent’s Premiership.
He is now in the top of the rankings, being the only team without any defeat of the ten.
Ultimately, everything summed up in their better defense, as well as the fact that they took more of the odds, which helped the host team and pleased coach Peter Murchie.
"We have been tested several times during our matches so far and we continue to be invincible, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie de Melrose said: “Merit is given to Ayr, they have taken more chances than we have.”
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt, transformed by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr an advantage, but a yellow cardboard received by Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was able to join the team, playing the Warriors profits, allowed the team to put the Jagcarree in the same way.
Climo got a penalty for Ayr and, even in the middle of the game, managed to sign up, and then managed to transform an individual try, and the score was 17-5 for Ayr at break.
But Melrose started the second replay very well, and Patrick Anderson's essay, transformed by Baggot, reduced the margin to five points.
The game was suspended for a few minutes due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who was removed from the field with the sign, and since the game was resumed, Ayr was unleashed through the trial of player Stafford McDowall, transformed by Climo.
Ayr team captain Blair Macpherson then received a yellow cardboard and again, the Melrose team made the backup player pay with Bruce Colvine's untransformed attempt at the end of a massive pressure.
However, the host team recovered, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow cardboard because he liked Climo without the ball, MacPherson managed to mark, giving him the advantage of the Ayr team.
Climo transformed the attempt, as he did again near the start of the game, after Kyle Rowe executed a box kick and sent extreme Gregor Henry deep for the host team's fifth attempt.
The star of the sitcom "Still Game" appears ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Ford Kiernan, star of the sitcom "Still Game", seems ready to move into the hospitality industry after learning that he has been appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old man plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the BBC's favorite show, writing the script and playing alongside his longtime partner, comedy actor Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the next series, the one with the number nine, will be the last, and it seems that Kieman is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the official registry, this is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the news, although a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kiernan wants to be involved in the “restaurant-developing industry.”
“The sea is ours”: Bolivian island hopes the court will reopen its way to the Pacific
The Marines patrol a naval headquarters full of shipwrecks in La Paz.
Public buildings tree the blue flag, like the ocean.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are covered with the motto: “The sea is our right.
We need to get it back."
Throughout Bolivia, which has no way out to the sea, the memory of a coast lost before Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict is still alive – just as the desire to navigate again into the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are probably at the highest level in recent decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a judgment of the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the necessary adventure, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, awaits the result with a positive vision,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the decision of the ICJ on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will give a ruling in favour of Bolivia’s claim and that, after decades of firm discussions, Chile is obliged to negotiate a sovereign exit to the sea, Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia – who is facing a controversial fight for next year’s re-election – also has a lot to gain from Monday’s decision.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia, and that things would change too little if it happened.
The U.N. agency in the Netherlands has no power to grant the territory that belongs to Chile and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the ICJ’s decision comes just six months after the final plea was heard indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And not only did Bolivia not succeed, but it is possible that the last four years have given it back.
“The problem of access to the sea was diverted by the current Bolivian administration,” Zarate said.
Morales’ belligerent rhetoric weakened any Chilean residual will, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision-making process was unusually fast.
Monday will bring for Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of mutually beneficial disagreements," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the most beloved presidents in Latin America – used the maritime issue as a political support.
“Bolivia will never give up the right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“Decision is an opportunity to see that we have to go through the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not take place if it cannot be trusted in the United States
Ri Yong Ho, North Korea’s foreign minister, said his country would never disarm its nuclear weapons if it could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke about this on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep its promises during a summit in Singapore with the leaders of its rivals.
His comments come in the context where U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to resume diplomatic actions on the nuclear threat more than three months after a meeting in Singapore with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was an "irreal view" that the continued sanctions and the U.S. objection to the declaration regarding the end of the Korean war would ever make the territory of the North surrender.
Washington is reluctant to agree with the statement without Pyongyang taking significant disarmament measures first.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there are many skeptics who do not believe that Pyongyang has serious intentions to give up the arsenal that the country considers the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
A fashion show in Paris presents the latest trends in hats and will be available in stores soon
If you’re looking for hats to expand your collection or completely protect yourself from the sun, you don’t have to look anymore.
Fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne shocked participants at Paris Fashion Week, launching a series of oversized and extravagant hats for their 2019 spring-summer collection.
The practical hats at all conquered the Instagram platform this summer, and fashion creators sent the creations that steal the eyes on the podium.
The resistance piece of the creation, made by Valentino, was an extravagant beige hat, with a wide bore, similar to a pen, in which the heads of the models sank.
Other oversized accessories included melons decorated with barley, a wizard hat and even an ananas, but they are not created to protect your head from the cold.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of strange masks, in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had sewn lips and brought more of Hannibal Lecter's chosen accessory, and not high-seam fashion.
One of the creations seemed to be a diving equipment, with an oxygen tube and glasses, while the other seemed to be a melted ice cube.
And if you want to continue adopting such a clothing style, with oversized clothing items, you are lucky.
Stylists expect a return of huge bones in luxury fashion stores.
The oversized hats come back after the appearance of the “La Bomba” hat, the straw hat with a wide drill, seen to everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The return of the practical hat that appeared on all social networks caused the appearance of another oversized creation on the podium, namely beach pay bags, with the same size as the model in the bathing suit that wears it.
The orange rafia bag, with rafia fringes and a white leather handle, was the strength piece of Jacquemus’s Spring-Summer 2019 “La Riviera” collection at Fashion Week in Paris
Star stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see oversized hats and beach bags in luxury stores next summer because the fashion designer has had such a strong impact that it will be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Linguistic Skills, Essential for Global Citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding exam results, which is supported by individual and collective successes in sport, art, music and other community efforts.
With over 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are striving to provide services at the highest level to their students and parents.
Independent schools offer to prepare their students for high school and higher education, their chosen career, and their place as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a special school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular and desired subject of choice within schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, your words will come to his mind.
If you speak to him in his own language, the words come to his heart.”
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year’s competition, we note that foreign languages are among the top rankings, with the highest rates of promotion in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who have studied foreign languages have obtained a Higher Grade A certificate.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72% of students obtained a Higher Grade A certificate in Mandarin; also 72% of those who study German, 69% of those who study French and 63% of those who study Spanish have obtained a certificate.
This demonstrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Now, foreign languages, as a subject, hold the same as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and in other fields.
A survey conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that, for reasons employers gave to fight for vacancies, 17% were attributed to a language skills deficit.
Therefore, increasingly, linguistic skills become imperative for preparing young people for their future careers.
With more job opportunities requiring foreign languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future, having such a lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a survey by YouGov of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% could not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only two-digit language spoken, 15%.
Therefore, investing in learning foreign languages is important for today’s children.
Having more languages, especially in developing economies, children will have more chances of finding meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, each school will teach other foreign languages.
A number of schools will focus on more modern classical languages, while others will learn the languages that are considered to be the most important for the UK when looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be more languages of choice within independent schools, with faculty who specialize in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and encourage them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future.
It cannot be denied right now, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be vital for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It has to be done well (it has to be done).

LeBron will make his debut at the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's opening season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he will play is still to be settled.
“There will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James is likely to play limited minutes.
Following training from the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for the six-game pre-season Lakers program.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need any games in front of me to get ready,” he said.
Time of Trump’s West Virginia election rally, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of campaigning rally tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump’s five meetings scheduled for next week, which include stops in places where the electorate is favourable to him, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the confirmation vote for the candidate he chose for the vacancy in the Supreme Court is temporarily suspended, Trump wants to strengthen support for upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time will Trump’s election rally in West Virginia take place tonight and where can I follow him online?
The Trump summit in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 19:00 East Coast time, tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s election rally in West Virginia online through the live video stream below on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss this week's hearing of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, a hearing that has become tense due to allegations of improper sexual behavior, while the Senate's expected confirmation vote is suspended for a week, for the FBI to investigate.
But the main objective of this series of rallyes is to help Republicans, who are facing tough elections in November, gain a bit of ground.
Trump’s campaigners said the role of these five rallyes next week was “energizing volunteers and supporters, while Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority held in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
"Control over Congress is so important to its agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible before entering the very crowded campaign season," a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Scheduled to take place at Wheeling’s Wesbanco Arena, the meeting could attract supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and be featured in the Pittsburgh media,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won the election at a difference of more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican Senate candidate in West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is led in polls.
“The fact that the president came to try to propel him in polls is not a good sign for Morrisey,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows determination and continues to fight to keep the chance for simple trials starting Sunday
After three clearly-dominated sessions, it is possible that Saturday afternoon’s foursome test was exactly what the Ryder Cup needed.
The always oscillating pendulum of motivation is a concept invented for the world of sports, but players really believe in it, especially in competitions like this.
So, where is their motivation now?
“We were led by six points, now the difference is just four points, so we’re relying on this drop for a little bit of motivation,” said Jordan Spieth at the end of the day.
Europe still has the advantage, of course, with a four-point advance, when there are still twelve points at stake.
The Americans, Spieth says, feel that the game is starting to change in their favor and that there are enough reasons for encouragement, the most important of which is the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and won every three out of four points.
Spieth sent the balls to the green area with deadly precision, being an example for his colleagues.
Those festive screams became more and more noisy as the round progressed, especially when he scored a crucial point by which he regained the score in the fourth match, after he and Thomas had been led by two points after the first two holes.
The shot he won the match at 15 was celebrated with a similar scream, a scream that makes you think the American team still has chances.
“You just have to focus and worry about your own game,” Spieth says.
That's all that's left for these players.
18 holes to make a good impression.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable revelation of the Ryder Cup.
The strange, but adorable, European couple has won four of the four matches and it seems they can’t make a mistake.
"Moliwood" was the only pair that didn't need any extra hits on Saturday afternoon, but this statement is valid for Saturday morning, and for Friday afternoon, and even for the nine Friday morning points.
This performance and how their energy seems to flow towards and from the enthusiastic audience reinforces the view that they will be the most dangerous players on Sunday. No other player would be more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari if they would lead to a good end.
Preferably, both at the same time, at different holes.
Discussions about the glory of Europeans remain premature, for the time being.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly crossed over to Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning at the fourballs, when he paired with Alex Noren.
An additional blow and two doubles at the first nine holes sunk the Spaniard and the Swede into a pit so deep that they weren’t even close to getting out of it.
On Sunday, however, no one will be safe.
The samples of fourballs and foursomes are fascinating and deserve close follow-up due to interactions between pairs, dated and undated tips and how a strategy can change on the spot.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far and have a significant advantage in the final day, but this foursome session also showed that the US team has the motivation to continue the fight, something that some, especially those in the United States, doubted.
Europe leads by 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe starts the last day of the Ryder Cup with a significant advantage after finishing Saturday’s fourballs and foursome games with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The inspired pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the two-victory offensive against a hesitant Tiger Woods, which increased their score so far at Le Golf National to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, trying to regain the trophy he lost to Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American players who made many mistakes in the morning fourballs test and won the series with a score of 3 to 1.
The U.S. opposed a more serious resistance to the foursome, where it won two games, but was unable to reduce the deficit.
Jim Furyk’s team needs eight points out of Sunday’s 12 simple matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to win four points in a row, and together with Molinari, a pair nicknamed “Molliwood” after a sensational weekend, they are the second pair to win four points out of four opening matches in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they were superbly supported to defeat discouraged Woods and American novice Bryson Dechambeau with an even clearer score of 5-4.
Woods, who had problems in the two games on Saturday, occasionally had genius slips, but so far has lost 19 of the 29 fourballs and foursome games, seven of which were consecutive defeats.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning fourball session, returned with partner Henrik Stenson in the foursome and defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the world’s first and third positions by 2-1.
Europe, however, did not have a barrier-free route on this pleasant and cool day in the southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, the triple winner of major tournaments, and Justin Thomas became the benchmark for the Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
They managed to win a 2-1 match played against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs, then came back later and defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy by 4 to 3 in the foursomes.
Just twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, a team managed to recover a four-point deficit in simple trials, though, because they are current trophy holders, Furyk players only need an equal score.
However, after being in second place for two consecutive days, a Sunday counterattack seems unlikely.
North Korea says there is "no chance" of unilateral disarmament as long as there is no trust
North Korea’s foreign minister said on Saturday that the extension of sanctions would deepen distrust in the United States and that it is impossible for its country to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Council's Annual General Assembly that "significant measures have been implemented in North Korea last year to prove their good faith", such as halting nuclear tests and missile testing, dismantling the nuclear test site and committing to nuclear nonproliferation and technology.
“However, we don’t see any appropriate response from the United States,” he said.
“If we can’t trust the U.S., we won’t trust our national security capabilities, and in such circumstances, we can’t disarm ourselves unilaterally first.”
Although Ri reiterated North Korea's familiar objections to Washington's opposing resistance to a "easy" denuclearization approach, according to which North Korea would be rewarded if it took gradual steps, his statement appeared significant because it did not directly reject the unilateral denuclearization.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump during a premiere summit between a U.S. president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim pledged to make progress on a “denuclearization of the North Korean peninsula’s nuclear power plant.”
North Korea sought an official end to the 1950-1953 Korean War, but the United States declared that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington has not given way to demands to relax the harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on the option of ‘first denuclearization’ and increases pressure by sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive manner, even objecting to the ‘declaration of ending the war’,” Ri said.
“The impression that sanctions can make us kneel is an illusion that only people who don’t know us have.
But the problem is that prolonged sanctions deepen our distrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader referred to at the United Nations earlier this week.
In contrast, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-in, the president of South Korea, over the past five months, adding: “If the issue of denuclearization had been negotiated with South Korea and not with the United States, the denuclearization of the non-Korean peninsula would not be in the hands of the Korean peninsula.”
Even under these conditions, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from last year's speech, when he told the UN General Assembly that it is inevitable to target the U.S. territory with missiles in North Korea after Trump's "malicious president" called a "southern" Kim.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened North Korea last year with “total destruction,” praised Kim for the courage to initiate the disarmament process, but said the work was just beginning and that the sanctions would remain in effect until North Korea is back.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no planned period for this, adding: “It doesn’t matter if it takes two or three years or five months.”
China and Russia say that Pyongyang should be rewarded by the UN Security Council for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and uninterrupted until we achieve complete, final and confirmed denuclearization.”
The Security Council unanimously increased North Korea’s sanctions since 2006 in an attempt to block funds for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit was not very good.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he said progress had been made, but only a few hours later, North Korea denounced that he made “gangster threats”.
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile launch ramp and a nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He said Kim had told him that the “appropriate measures” he was looking for were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and that he wanted normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Take Courses on How to Rest Enough
A new Harvard University course this year encourages students to sleep more, in an attempt to fight the growing “macho” culture that makes them submit to “all night” learning sessions energized with a lot of caffeine.
A scientist has discovered that, often, students of the world’s most prestigious universities don’t even master the basic concepts of the way they should take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the one who created the course, which is believed to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to create the course after holding a conference on the impact of lack of sleep on the ability to learn.
“A girl finally came and said to me, ‘Why is this being told to me only now, last year?’
She told me she had never been told about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, introduced to the premiere this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance, as well as overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university’s executive director of health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were seriously deprived of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course can involve a number of interactive tasks.
Within a section is presented the image of a home room, and students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports pants and books to tell them what are the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deficiency, but also about the importance of a sleep program.
In another section, participants were told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive pictograms, encourages participants to think about their daily schedule.
“We know we can’t change students’ behavior immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as anyone has the right to know what the effects of smoking on health are,” Professor Czeisler added.
The culture that makes students proud that they learned all night still exists, he adds, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure imposed on students have turned sleep deprivation into a growing problem.
Sufficient sleep, of good quality, should be a student’s “secret weapon” to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation makes the brain think that the body is hungry, that you constantly starve, what you’re doing on your chest.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler create the course after attending one of his courses in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course for all students.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before enrolling in this institution where the competition is fierce.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students program an alarm to know when it’s time to go to bed, as well as for the hour of waking up, and to know what are the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LEDs, which can disrupt the circadian rhythm when it comes to causing it.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal defeats Gerrard's team
The Rangers suffer from another case of displacement depression as Dolly Menga's blow condemned Steven Gerrard's unconvincing team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to win the first move from the 4-1 victory against St. Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team managed to manage Gerrard's second defeat of 18 games as a coach, which puts the Rangers in eight-point Premiers.
Menga signed seven minutes before the break and the uninspired players from the Rangers did not appear in any moment to match.
The Rangers thus fell to sixth place in the rankings, while Livingston climbed to third place, behind the Hibernian, in a single goal difference.
And the Rangers could also face other problems, as the cup arbitrator Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an object was apparently thrown out of the visitor team's fan's coat.
Gerrard changed eight players in the lottery which he easily won against Ayr in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same 11 players from Livingstone who managed to get an equal with the Hearts last week and has all the reason to be proud of the way his well-trained lot has suffocated his opponents during the game.
Even though the Rangers had a superior possession, Livingston used the balls they had more effectively.
He should have scored just two minutes after the start of the game, when Menga’s first pass pushed Scott Pittman to the goal defended by Allan McGregor, but the midfielder missed a very good opportunity.
A deep free kick of Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, sent her to the bar.
The Rangers took control, but left the impression that they had more hope than they trusted in their game in the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos strongly believed that he should have received a penalty when he clashed with Steven Lawless in the fifteenth minute of the game, but arbitrator Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian request.
The Rangers managed only two strikes on the goal in the first round, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not at all disturbed by Lassana Coulibaly's head or Ovie Ejaria's weak strike.
Although the 34-minute goal at Livingstone did not respect the trend of the game, no one can deny that it was worth it, even for the effort made.
Again, the Rangers failed to prevent Jacobs’ deep centering.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept quiet and passed it to Menga, who finished with a simple shot.
Gerrard took a break when he changed Ryan Kent with Coulibaly; this move almost immediately yielded fruit, when the extreme centered on Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out of the butts to block him.
But Livingston continued to attract visitors to exactly the same type of match they prefer, with Lithgow and Halkett intercepting center after center.
Holt's team could have expanded their advantage in the final stages, but McGregor managed to block Jacobs's hit, and then Lithgow sent the corner hit with his head next to the goalkeeper.
Glenn Middleton, a reserve at the Rangers, demanded a penalty to the end of the game, when he was hit by Jacobs but again, Thomson did not agree.
Almanah: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page in our Almanahul on Sunday morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago (and the Continuous Counting...), is the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of the device known as the Geiger counter.
An essential device for science since then, the Geiger storyteller has also become essential for pop culture, as was the case in the 1950 film The Bells of San Coronado, in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played the role of cowboys with improbable inclinations.
Man: “What else is that?”
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you can hear the effects of atoms emitted by radioactivity in minerals.”
Evans: “Yes, a lot of whistles are heard!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before he turned 63.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to “Detecte” Harmful Cells
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Your Immune System to “Detecte” Harmful Cells and Destroy them
As part of treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in a laboratory
They can “detect” a protein common to many cancers and then be reinjected
A test vaccine provides promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
Ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory so that they can “detect” a common protein of many cancers, called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Oncology Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our findings suggest that we are dealing with a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "determines the growth of several types of cancers, including those of the breast, ovaries, pulmonary and colorectal, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach, taking immune cells from patients and “learning” them to target cancer cells, also worked for the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West held a Trump support diatribe while wearing a MAGA hat after the appearance at the SNL.
It didn't work out too well.
Kanye West was evacuated from the studio during Saturday Night Live after a disappointed show in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he intends to run for the 2020 election.
After playing the third song, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a Make America Great hat, the artist unveiled a speech against Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
“Often when I talk to a white person, I’m asked, ‘How can you like Trump?’”
Well, if I had been concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the show with a scene in which Matt Damon played, in which the Hollywood star took over Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on charges of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, West's diatribe filming was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock was trying to take over West with this post.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had problems with his claws.
“They tried to intimidate me in the hallways.
They told me, “Don’t go out wearing this hat.”
I was assaulted!
They also told me I was very low," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on, "Do you want to see how low I got?", and then he said, "I'm going to grab Superman's mantle, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try it with love.”
His comments attracted fugitives from the public at least twice, and members of the SNL team seemed to be embarrassed, Variety reported; a person from this team said to the publication: "A complete silence was laid in the studio."
West was invited as a last-minute replacement for soloist Ariana Grande, whose lover, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West raised many eyebrows when he performed the song I Love It Dressed as a Perrier Glass.
West was backed by TPUSA Conservative leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: “For one of the bravest spirits among us: THANK YOU THAT YOU WILL FRONT THE GLOAT.”
Karen Hunter, host of a talk show, tweeted that West, simply, “was himself and that’s wonderful.”
“But I choose not to reward anyone (buying their music or clothing or supporting their ‘art’) who I think embraces and expresses a harmful ideology for my community.
He's free.
And so are we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, announcing that from now on he is “the being officially known as Kanye West.”
He is not the first artist to change his name; West is chasing after Diddy, previously known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, took the name Snoop Lion and, of course, former music legend, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to "the artist formerly known as Prince".
Accused of attempted murder for beating at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after another man was bitten in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defense attorney is expected to appear before the Belfast Court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor.
Kit Harington, the Star of the Thrones, Attacks Toxic Masculinity
Kit Harington is known for the role of Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Urzeala of the Thrones, produced by HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that presenting these roles on the screen makes the boys think they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said it appeared "something was wrong" and wondered how the toxic masculinity problem could be managed in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his colleague in the Thrones, Rose Leslie, who is still 31, admitted that he is "very determined" to talk about the issue.
“Personally, I’m very determined to talk about this now: where did I go wrong with masculinity?” he asked.
“What have we taught men how to be adults, given the problem we are now facing?”
Kit believes that television could be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity through highly male characters.
He continued: “What is born and what is taught?
What do young boys learn from TV and on the street, what makes them think that they have to be a certain type of man?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time: how can we change this?
Because it’s clear that something wrong has happened to the young people.”
In the interview, he acknowledged that he will not play in any series based on the Urzal of the Thrones after the series ends in the summer of next year, saying he "has finished with the battlefields and with the horses."
From November, Kit will play in a new production of Sam Shepard’s True West theatrical play, which presents the story of a filmmaker and his brother, who is the thief.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that happened to him due to the series "The Horror of Thrones" was that he met his wife, Rose.
“I met my wife when I made this series, so it secured my family’s future and my life from now on,” Kit said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, Jon Snow's girlfriend, the character played by Kit in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018, on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of Chinese citizens suffering from HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by the disease in China, officials say.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been sexually transmitted, unlike in the past.
In the past, HIV has spread rapidly to some areas of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
From year to year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an acute problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widely considered.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually get married to a woman.
Many cases of disease transmission come from inadequate sexual protection measures in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of its efforts to resolve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has disclosed data to Republican senators, talks about “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her team posted personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed the allegations were made by analysts and websites of “extreme right.”
"Minutes, lies and other miserable lies," Waters said in a tweet.
The disclosures included the senators' personal addresses and phone numbers, including Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Tuesday, posted by an unknown person from Capitol Hill during a hearing in the Senate on allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior against Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated as a judge in the Supreme Court.
The information leak occurred shortly after the three senators asked Kavanaugh questions.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with the Waters office and presented the information to a member of the Waters team, Hill reported.
“These unfounded allegations are completely false, an absolute lie,” Waters said.
“The team member, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these false accusations, was in no way responsible for the leakage of this information.
These unfounded accusations are completely false, an absolute lie.”
Waters' statements were criticized online shortly after they were made, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is furious,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that he doesn’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven’t done, they don’t have to be angry.
It doesn't have to be challenging.
He must not question the reasoning of the defendant.
It has to be calm and calm.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to that of Judge Kavanaugh, criticised by Democrats, who said he appeared a little too angry during Tuesday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican who is running against Waters in mid-term elections, also commented on the situation on Twitter.
“It’s important, if it’s true,” he wrote.
In her statement, Waters said her office had alerted “adequate authorities and legal entities to these false accusations.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators will be discovered, and that they will be liable before the law for all their destructive and dangerous actions for any of my team members.”
Review Johnny English hits again: flagless parody of spy movies, with Rowan Atkinson in the lead role
It has become a tradition to seek Brexit-associated meanings in any new British film, but this does not apply to the new film in the parody series of action films that has as the main character Johnny English, the series that began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English.
Will this splendid satire of how strange we are be to become the nation’s new export opportunity?
Anyway, Johnny English, the incompetent spy with his eyes glossed and rubber face, was renewed his license for the second time to ruin everything. The character's name means, first of all, that it is a general comic creation for the cinematic audience in the lands of the underworld.
He is, of course, the shredded secret agent who, despite his claims to luxury and extravagance, has a little of Clouseau, a drop of Mr. Bean and a knife tip of that guy who contributed with a single note to the 2012 musical theme of Loriots of Fire at the Jordi of the Olii ceremonies.
The character is based on the explorer and mysterious homeless man that Atkinson once played in Barclaycard TV ads, which left chaos behind.
This last adventure of JE also has one or two cute moments.
I liked when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and the rotor paws hit his hair slightly.
Atkinson’s gift for physical comedy is highlighted, but humor is rather weak and, strangely, superfluous, especially because “serious” films, such as the 007 series or Mission Impossible, reliably offer comedy moments as an ingredient.
Humor seems to be more targeted at children than adults, and for me, Johnny English’s cartoon adventures aren’t as inventive and smart as Atkinson’s silent film gags when he plays Bean.
As usual, the premise is always that the UK has serious problems.
A cyber-hacker infiltrated Britain’s supersecret web of spies and revealed the identities of British agents undercover, to the despair of the service agent, a regrettable minor role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the last drop for a pompous and under siege, already suffering a serious crisis due to the decline in political popularity: Emma Thompson does everything she can with her character like Theresa May, but the scenario doesn’t give her a chance to shine.
Her secret intelligence advisers inform her that all active spies have been compromised, so she must activate a backup agent.
This is Johnny English's own cousin, now working as a teacher in a high school, but he also gives lessons on how to be an undercover agent. Here are some cute cunts, because English runs a School of Rock-style spy academy.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency session, then reunited with his longtime partner, Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a very enthusiastic and valuable character, the role in which Vicki Pepperdine's talent is a little wasted.
Thus, these Batman and Robin of creating confusion in His Majesty's Secret Service return to action, facing the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls into the spell of a charismatic billionaire tech industry who claims he can solve Britain’s IT problems: sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on an odyssey of burlesque adventures: disguised in waiters, set fire to a fashionable French restaurant, create chaos when it sweeps on Volta’s luxury boat, and then English triggers purely familiar anarchy when it tries to use a real-life home for a virtual och set.
This last sequence is very ambitious, but no matter how cute and colorful the film is, it looks like a children’s television production.
A rather mediocre film.
As with the other Johnny English movies, I can’t stop asking myself: can’t the British film industry really give Rowan Atkinson a role to match his talent?
Labourers deny that they plan to work four days a week, but be paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party would have a radical plan, according to which the British would only work four days a week, but would be paid for five days.
It seems that the party wants corporate leaders to benefit from the possible savings due to the AI revolution by giving employees another day off.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but their salary would not change.
Sources say that the idea would “fit” for the party’s economic program, which wants to tilt the balance in favour of the workers.
The transition to the four-day working week is supported by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A source from the Labour Party’s leadership told The Sunday Times: “The announcement of a policy review is expected before the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is an appropriate aspiration in addressing the rebalancing party of the economy in favour of the worker, as well as in the general strategy of the industrial party."
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea; the four-day working week was one of the Green Party’s promises in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not supported by all the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not a party policy and is not taken into account by the party.”
The chancellor of the shadow cabinet, John McDonnell, took advantage of last week’s Labour conference to describe his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from “facial directors” and “profiters” from utility providers.
The plans of the shadow cabinet's chancellor also refer to the fact that the current shareholders of the water supply regimes may not fully recover their shares, because the Labour government could receive "deductions" due to crimes found.
He also confirmed plans to appoint employees to the company’s boards of directors and create ownership funds by handing over 10% of the private sector firms’ equity to employees, who will receive annual dividends of up to about <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy reveal in the 60 Minutes show if Kavanaugh's FBI investigation would make him change his mind
The FBI's investigation into the charges brought against Judge Brett Kavanaugh postponed the final vote on his nomination as a Supreme Court judge by at least a week and raises the question of whether Republican senators could be persuaded to no longer support him because of the FBI's findings.
In a broadcast interview on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find information that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more willing to do that than his South Carolina colleague.
“Of course,” said Kennedy.
“I said this from the beginning of the hearings; I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when this happened, when the charges came up, and I asked him, “Are you guilty?”
The answer was decided, promptly, without hesitation."
Graham’s voice, however, seems to be digging in the rock.
“I’m determined about Brett Kavanaugh, so it would need some explosive charges,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly rejects the charges," Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“None of the people named by her have confirmed the report.
And it happened 36 years ago.
I doubt that something will change.”
What is the Global Citizens Festival and has it managed to do something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizens Festival, an annual musical event attended by an impressive group of stars, with an equally impressive mission: eradicating global poverty.
Arriving at the seventh edition, the Global Citizens Festival will attract tens of thousands of people on the Central Park, not only to follow artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true goal of the event, eliminating extreme poverty by 20.
The Global Citizens Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket at the event (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), spectators had to pay for a number of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, sending emails to world leaders, making phone calls to the world’s leaders, making phone calls to the world’s top-notch, or eliminating important things.
But what success did the Global Citizens Festival have when it was only 12 years old to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to convince them to act, or is it just another case of so-called “clickism”, a concept that refers to people who feel they have achieved something by signing an online petition or sending a message on Twitter?
According to Global Citizen, since 2011, more than 19 million “actions” have been registered by its supporters, which have promoted different objectives.
The organization says these actions have pushed world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than <0x24>37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group spoke of 390 commitments and announcements caused by its shares, on which at least <0x24>10 billion has already been spent or collected.
The group estimates that the funds insured so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and intermediaries who have pledged to “help children grow to their full potential,” who promised to give Rwanda <0x24>700 million after a global share of <0x24>35 million to help clear the gap.
“With the help of the UK’s government, donors, national governments and some global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition just a footnote in the history book,” said Tracey Ullman, the ambassador in a 2018 speech to The Power of Nutrition.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions have been carried out in the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government has announced it will finance The Power of Nutrition project, which will provide nutrition interventions for 5 million women and children.
The answer to one of the most frequently asked questions on their website: “What makes you think you can eliminate extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen responded: “It will be a long and difficult journey, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the big civil rights or anti-apartheid movements that took place before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the artists who will sing at this year’s New York event, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use naval forces to "block" Russia's energy exports, Interior Secretary says
Washington can, “if necessary,” appeal to naval forces to prevent Russian energy from reaching certain markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said, citing the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argues that Russia’s commitment to Syria, especially where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think the reason I’m in the Middle East is because I want to intermediate energy sales, as I do in Eastern Europe and the southern part of Europe,” he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and methods to manage the situation.
“The United States has the capacity, through our naval forces, to ensure that the maritime routes are open and, if necessary, to create a blockade, so that energy does not come out on the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the participants at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that declared itself “the voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
He continued by comparing the way Washington interacts with Russia and Iran, showing that the approach is practically the same.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, the use and replacement of fuels,” he said, saying of Russia that he “knows one trick” because of the fossil fuel-dependent economy.
The statements come at a time when the Trump administration is trying to increase liquefied natural gas exports to Europe to replace Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
In this regard, Trump administration representatives, including President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, would turn Berlin into a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the <0x24>11 billion project of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline at 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin said the fierce U.S. opposition to the project is driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we’re looking at things the same way: energy can’t be an instrument of pressure and consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” said Aleksandr Novak, Russia’s energy minister, after a meeting with US energy secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position attracted critics from Germany, who reaffirmed their commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), has called on the United States not to interfere in EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with the fact that a third state intervenes in matters relating to our energy," said Dieter Kempf, President of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren “thinks seriously” to run for the 2020 presidential election, Massachusetts senator says
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she must “think seriously” if she runs for the presidential election after the midterm elections.
During the meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering a nomination.
“It’s time for a woman to go to Washington and repair our corrupt government, and for that, a strong woman is needed,” she said.
“After November 6th, I will seriously consider whether to run for the presidential election.”
Warren had something to say about President Donald Trump during the meeting at the city hall, saying that he "stepped the country in the wrong direction".
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren was a very vocal critic of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, the nominee for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said “normally we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll published Thursday showed that neither the majority of Warren’s voters believe they should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters said the senator should not run, according to a survey conducted by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent of respondents support such a nomination.
The poll showed more support for a nomination of former Governor Deval Patrick: 38% of respondents support a potential nomination of him and 48% are against.
Other names of well-known Democrats who could run in 2020 include Vice President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, the senator of Vermont.
Biden said he would make a formal decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin talks about the post-traumatic stress syndrome she suffers from Track Palin at a Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enrolling in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“The things my own son has gone through, through which he has gone after he has returned ... I can understand the suffering of other families who feel the ramifications of the post-traumatic stress syndrome and the consequences of the wounds that our soldiers are returning with,” he told the public at a rally in support of Donald Tullah.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said that her son and other war veterans "return a little different, harder, wondering if there is more respect for what she and their soldiers in the military and air forces, as well as all the other Ars members have done for them."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, preventing the reporting of an act of domestic violence, and holding a drunken gun, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and District of Columbia challenge new asylum application policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims trying to escape the violence caused by gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District have completed an application for amicus curiae in Washington on Friday to support a policy challenge to asylum-seekers, NBC News reports.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace v. Sessions trial initiated by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy was not disclosed.
She said her partner "and his violent sons, members of a gang" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The state-appointed lawyer who represents Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produced a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations facing a widespread problem of hostility and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 Immigrant Calls Council decision that allowed undocumented immigrants trying to escape domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The District Attorney General of Columbia, Karl Racine, said on Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation.”
“The federal law says that all asylum applications must be judged on the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a restriction violates this principle,” the Amicus curiae application said.
In addition, lawyers argue in demand that the policy that refuses to enter immigrants affects the U.S. economy, saying it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary workforce.”
Jeff Sessions, the U.S. Attorney General, ordered immigration justices in June to no longer grant asylum to victims who try to escape the abuses and violence of gangs.
“Asylum is granted to those who leave their country driven by persecution or fear because of discrimination on the grounds of race, religion, nationality or membership in a social group or because of a political opinion,” Sessions said on June 11.
The role of asylum has never been to solve all the problems people face every day in the world, not even all the serious problems.
Desperate rescue operations in Palu, where the number of deaths doubled, in a race against the chronometer to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
“The situation seems very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother who aligns her fever-stricken baby to an evacuation center in the city of Palu.
“Ambulances always bring troops.
Drinking water is insufficient.”
Residents began to return to their destroyed homes and organize their flooded goods, trying to save everything that could be saved.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale, were overcome by the situation.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered fractures to the spine and shoulder, rest outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients are treated outdoors due to strong and continuous replications.
He has tears in his eyes when he remembers how he felt the violent earthquake shaking the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, then just silence.
I don’t know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope I'm safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of “abusing” “propaganda”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. daily praising the mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the U.S. press to distribute propaganda material.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the supplement paid by China in the Des Moines Register, the best-selling newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of meddling in the November 6 congressional election, an accusation China rejects.
The accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in U.S. elections has marked what U.S. officials have said to Reuters is a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to post commercials promoting trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in a growing trade war, involving waves of rising import tariffs.
The tariffs imposed by China as revenge at the beginning of the trade war were created to affect exporters from states like Iowa, which supported Trump’s Republican Party, experts from China and the US said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former Iowa governor, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing wounded U.S. workers, farmers and businessmen.
In an editorial published Sunday in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote that China “continue this abuse by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free press.”
“When it disseminates propaganda by publishing an advertisement in the Des Moines Register, the Chinese government does not respect the tradition so precious in America of freedom of expression and a free press,” Branstad wrote.
“Instead, at the newspaper cradle on the street here in Beijing you will find few voices of dissidents and you will not see any real reflection of the divergent opinions Chinese citizens have about China’s worrying economic trajectory,” the media said.
He added that “one of the most important newspapers in China refused to publish” his article, although he did not say which newspaper it is.
Republicans alienate female voters from mid-term elections due to Kavanaugh scandal, analysts warn
Because many of the top Republicans support and protect Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court, from multiple sexual abuse allegations, analysts have warned that there will be a counter-reaction, especially on the part of women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions created by this scandal were extremely strong, and the majority of Republicans who have publicly discussed it intend to continue voting.
"Such reactions will not be forgotten," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he has doubts that the last-minute initiative of Senator Jeff Flake (Arizona's representative) on an FBI investigation will calm the angry electorate.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget tomorrow and they will not forget in November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, senior consultant and national spokeswoman for the Progressive Group, told the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November is coming!” while demonstrating in the Senate halls as Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee chose to continue Kavanaugh’s nomination process despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony, Mic reported.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be very great,” said Stu Rothenberg, an indivisible political analyst for the news site.
“People say they were already very big and that’s true.
But it could be even bigger, especially among indecisive female voters in the suburbs and the young electorate, between the ages of 18 and 29, who, although not agreeing with the president, often do not vote.
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which he detailed the sexual abuse charges brought to the nominee in the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that it could follow a counter-reaction if the Republicans continue the confirmation process.
"This has turned into a mess for Republicans," former chairman of the Republican National Committee Michael Steele said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the vote in the committee or the final vote or the possibility that Kavanaugh will be confirmed, it’s also about how the Republicans treated this situation and how they treated it,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, an electoral support group of Democrats, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be relatively divided about the part they should believe after Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimony: a little more people seem to believe the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents believe strongly or believe that Ford’s testimony was likely to be true, while 35% said they believe strongly or that Kavanaugh’s testimony is likely to be true.
In addition, 38% said Kavanaugh had probably or certainly lied, while only 30% said the same thing about Ford.
Following Flake’s initiative, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other person, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford sworn in to the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh had abused her drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the nominee exposed her genitals in front of her while attending a party while they were students at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Inventor Plans to Establish New Internet to Make Competition for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee’s Solid, open-source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has the right to access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt was “global domination.”
“Now we have to do it,” he said of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own “online personal data archives” or PODs.
It may contain contact lists, programs, calendars, music libraries or other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify would all be available in one browser, all at once.
What is unique about this online personal data archive is that the user has complete control over who can access this type of information.
The company calls this “personal data consolidation”.
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, the idea is that Inrupt contributes with appropriate resources, processes and skills so that Solid is available to everyone.
Currently, the company is composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a team of developers working on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team did not talk to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change when their business models are completely overhead at once.
“We don’t ask for your permission.”
In a post on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that “Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of a new Internet on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the Internet.
Even after launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic for this next era of the Internet,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: the clergyman who won the Victorian Cross in the First World War is celebrated
The only Anglican Church clergyman to win a Victorian Cross medal as a fighter in World War I was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant-Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won the medal on 29 September 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a gunman four days later and never knew that he had been awarded Britain’s highest military honor.
A memorial stone was unveiled on Saturday by his two grandchildren during the parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his nephews, Michael Vann, said he was "symbolically dismayed" that the stone would be unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather won the medal.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal "in a very soft fog and under the intense fire of artillery and machine guns."
Later, he hurried to get to the first line and, with a "fantastic bravery", opened the way for the soldiers, then attacked himself a nest of artillery and managed to eliminate three of the detachment weapons.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German gunman on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
The 72-year-old Michael Vann said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I’ll never be able to match, but that makes me feel shy.”
He, along with his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said he "feels very honoured to play a role in the parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that a lot of people give him."
MMA fans stayed awake all night to see Bellator 206, but received cartoons with Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine you’ve been awake all night watching Bellator 206, a multi-star event, just so you couldn’t watch the main event.
The San Jose event program contained 13 fights, including six on the main panel, and was to be broadcast live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., exactly as Gegard Mousasi was preparing to face Rory MacDonald, British viewers were surprised when the broadcast was replaced with an episode of Peppa Pig.
Some were not satisfied at all, because they had been awake all night to watch the fight.
A fan on Twitter described the transition to children’s cartoon as “a sort of bad joke.”
"Government regulations say this content is not suitable for 6 a.m., so they had to change to children's programs," Bellator senior vice president for marketing and communication Dave Schwartz said when asked about the broadcast.
“Pig Peppa, yes.”
Scott Coker, the president of Bellator, said that in the future, they will program their events in such a way that they can also be watched by viewers in the UK.
“When I think of rehearsals, I think we could probably fix it,” Coker said.
“But it’s six in the morning on a Sunday here and we won’t be able to do this until Sunday, our time, or Monday, their time.
But we're working on this.
Believe me, when the program changed, I started receiving a lot of text messages and they weren’t all friendly.
We tried to solve the situation, we thought it was a technical mess.
But it wasn’t about that, it was about governmental regulation.
I can promise you it won't happen again next time.
We're going to summarize five fights instead of six, as we usually do. We tried to offer fans more and we exceeded the limit.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels 'Lower' Because of Sexuality
Olympic scout Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but this motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he only realized when he got to school that “not everyone is like me.”
Invited to the first Desert Island Discs show presented by Lauren Laverne on Radio 4, he said he was talking about gay people's rights to give "hope" to others.
The athlete also said that when he became a parent, he cared less about the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular presenter of the traditional show, will be missing for a few months due to a disease.
Invited in Laverne’s first edition, Daley said that when he was a child he felt “lower” than others because “it was socially unacceptable for me to like both boys and girls.”
“So far, these feelings of inferiority and the fact that I felt different, it was the real things that gave me the strength and the resistance to gain success.”
He wanted to prove that he’s “someone,” he said, so he wouldn’t disappoint everyone when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals at the Olympics became a renowned supporter of LGBT campaigns and took advantage of the appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to demand more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he decided to speak because he felt lucky that he could live free, without persecution, and because he wanted to give others “hope.”
The triple world champion said he was “taken by surprise” by the fact that he fell in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black.
Daley married Oscar-winning filmmaker who is 20 years older than him last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" - he participated in the first Olympics when he was only 14, and his father died of cancer after three years - he said, it's hard to find someone of the same age who has gone through the same good and bad times.
The two became parents in June of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, which, according to Daley, changed his "whole perspective".
“If I had been asked last year, I wouldn’t have been interested in anything other than winning a gold medal,” he said.
“You know what? There are things more important than the gold medals at the Olympics.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he wanted was to find out if he had gotten tickets for the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to be first.
“I couldn’t say, ‘You can’t be first, Dad,’” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing and only after he stopped breathing and died I finally accepted that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I knew that was what I had dreamed of my whole life, jumping in front of my country’s spectators at the Olympics, there’s no better feeling,” he said.
This also inspired him in the music of his choice, Proud by Heather Small, a song that encouraged him before the Olympics and still excites him.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15.
Mickelson, out of shape, was transferred to the reserve bank on Saturday at the Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Saturday, when he will play in the forty-seventh Ryder Cup match, but he will have to get back in good shape so it won’t be an unfortunate occasion.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial event for the twelfth time, another record, was passed on the reserve bench by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as it was often for the U.S. team, the five-time winner of major tournaments shared his day between being a major for teammates and exercising his shots, hoping to rectify what was wrong.
The 48-year-old has never had the right drives, not even in the best period of his career, so it’s not the best choice for the narrow terrain at Le Golf National, where the long areas of rough often punish the wrong hits.
And if the pitch isn’t a big enough challenge, in Sunday’s ninth game Mickelson will face Francesco Molinari, the meticulous British Open champion, who allied himself with novice Tommy Fleetwood and won all four games of the week.
Mickelson’s match could prove absolutely crucial for the Americans, led by four points at the start of the 12 simple games, which must begin in force at this stage.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player’s ability, but could not have said anything else anyway.
“He fully understood the role he had today, hit me on the shoulder, hugged me and told me he was going to be ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play in two games.
I imagined more, but that’s what happened, and that’s how we thought we should proceed.
He wants to play, like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for most games played in the Ryder Cup.
This could be the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which has not yet risen to his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 games won, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk said his presence brought some intangible advantages to the team.
“It’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s smart, he likes to joke with the players, he’s a wonderful guy in the team’s locker room,” he said.
“I think the young players are having fun joking with him, it was fun to see them do this during the week.
His role is more important, it’s not just about the game.”
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows that the considerable advance could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the Europeans, knows from experience that the considerable advance held before the first day of simple trials in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable journey.
Danish debuted in the 1997 match at Valderrama, when the team led by captain Seve Ballesteros led the Americans by five points, but only if he managed to defeat them with a minimum difference, from 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 to 131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“I remember we had a considerable advance at Valderrama; we had a big advance at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we barely managed to win,” Bjorn said after watching the 2018 team win by 5-3, both on Friday and now on National Golf.
“So, history shows me and my team that it’s not ready yet.
Tomorrow we have to play at the maximum turn.
Let’s go out on the field and do everything perfectly.
The game is not ready until after the points are passed on the table.
We have a goal and this is to win this trophy, this must remain the goal.
“We’ve always said we need to focus on the 12 players on our team, but we know what’s going on in the other side: the best players in the world.”
Glad about how his players managed on a difficult terrain, Bjorn added: “I’m not in a hurry to draw conclusions.
Tomorrow is a completely different situation.
Tomorrow, individual performance is important, and this is different.
It’s great to be on the field with a partner when things go well, but when you’re on your own, then you’re tested to the maximum, as a golfer.
This is the message you need to convey to the players, that they must be in the best shape tomorrow.
Now they leave their partner behind and they have to play as well as they can.”
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk, the captain of the opposing team, hopes his players will play the simple test better than they did with their partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself was on both sides of such returns on the last day: he was in the winning team at Brookline, then in the losing one when Europe succeeded in the "miracle of Medina".
"I remember every word," he said when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, managed to encourage his players before the last day.
“We have 12 major games tomorrow and we would like to start with some quick wins, like at Brookline, like at Medina.
When the inertia develops in a direction, it puts a lot of pressure on those matches from the middle.
"We created the right lot and ordered the players as we wish, you know, we're trying to create a little magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to lead the fight: he will face Rory McIlroy in the main game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the second half of the program.
“I have chosen this group of players in this order because I think it covers all the subjects,” Bjorn said of the match for the simple test.
Germany's new warship, postponed again
The newest frigate of the German naval forces should have been put into operation in 2014 to replace the outdated ships of the Cold War, but this will only happen in the year, due to defective systems and rising costs.
The entry into service of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigate class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to be introduced to the naval forces in 2014, but problems after delivery affected this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
They are supposed to be equipped with a powerful cannon, with a range of anti-aircraft and anti-vas missiles, as well as stealth technologies, which provide a low radar, infrared and acoustic footprint.
Other important features will include longer maintenance periods; it should be possible for new frigates to leave on two-year missions without returning to the original port.
However, the continuing delays mean that these next-generation warships, which are said to increase Germany’s naval strength, will already be outdated before entering service, Die Zeit notes.
The F125 frigate was discussed in the press last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the builder after delivery.
There is not much information available about the reasons for the refusal, but German media cited a number of crucial “software and hardware defects” that would have made the warship useless in a combat mission.
Software defects were particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessels will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half of the crew on the oldest Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it was shown that the ship weighed too much, which reduced its performance and limited the Navy's ability to add future supplies.
The 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate vessel is believed to be twice as heavy as the German vessels used in World War II.
In addition to the faulty mechanisms, and the cost of the entire project, including that of training the crew, has become a cause for concern.
It is said to have reached an astonishing <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0x24>3.6 billion) from the initial price of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems of the most recent frigates are of particular importance given the latest warnings that Germany’s maritime power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliamentary defence committee, acknowledged that the Navy "began to be left without vessels that could be sent to missions".
The official said the problem has steadily increased over time, as old vessels have been decommissioned without being replaced with new ones.
He lamented the fact that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates entered service in the Navy.
National Trust spies the secret life of lionesses
New research on a property in the Scottish Highlands wants to reveal how lionesses use their environment to hunt prey.
It is hoped that the findings will reveal new things about the behavior of these unprecedented flying mammals and help future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland, will analyze common dwarf dwarfs and pygmy dwarfs, as well as ear dwarfs and water dwarfs from Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed in key locations around the property to track the activity of the lily throughout the season.
The NHS team and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using manual detectors.
A specialized audio analysis of all recordings will estimate the frequency of sounds made by lionesses and what species emit certain sounds.
There will also be produced a habitat map and a report, to create a detailed, scaled image of their behaviour in the environment.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation consultant for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas in the habitat are most important for lionesses and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as creating a lawn, and which is the best way to maintain forest meadows and other associated species.
The populations of lionesses in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined considerably in the last century.
They are endangered by the construction and development work that affects their nests, as well as the loss of their habitat.
And wind turbines and public lighting are risks, just like mosquito traps and some chemical treatments for building materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
In fact, lionesses are not blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching peaches.
They use a sophisticated ecolocation technique to accurately identify insects and obstacles on their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major parks and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, is thinking very seriously about lily.
They have ten trained experts, who periodically conduct studies, control their nests, and sometimes carry out rescue missions.
The organization created the first and only reserve of lily in Scotland, on the Threave Mosque in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight out of ten species of lily in Scotland are found.
David Thompson, the manager of the moose, says this is the ideal territory for lionesses.
“Here at Threave, the area is great for lionesses,” he says.
“We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and a perfect habitat.
But there are many things we don’t know about lionesses, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand why they need them to multiply.”
It emphasizes the importance of looking for lionesses before performing maintenance work on the property, as the simple unintentional destruction of a maternal nest could kill up to 400 females and chickens, which can destroy all the local population.
Lilies are protected, and killing, harassing or disturbing them, as well as destroying their nests, are prohibited actions.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official at the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help them.
She said, “We still have a lot to learn about lionesses and we don’t know how populations evolve for many of our species.”
Ronaldo denies rape allegations as lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo said the allegations against him were “fake news” and that some people “would like to advertise” using his name.
His lawyers are determined to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping an American woman identified as Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that the footballer paid her <0x24>375,000 to not talk about the incident.
A few hours after the allegations were released, in a video streamed on Instagram Live for its 142 million followers, 33-year-old Ronaldo said it was “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," the Golden Balloon winner said in front of the video camera.
"They're going to make their own ads using my name.
It's normal.
They want to get famous using my name, but I'm used to it.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for these allegations, which they called “an unacceptable report of suspicions of privacy,” according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for “moral damages equivalent to an adequate sum for the severity of the act, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009, in an apartment at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a club, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he raped her anal, according to documents filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that after the incident, Ronaldo fell on his knees in front of her and told her that he was "a good boy" at "99%" and that he was betrayed by that "one percent".
The document claims that Ronaldo confirmed that he had sex with the defendant, but that they were consensual.
Mayorga claims that she addressed the police and that the photos of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later accepted an agreement outside the courtroom because she was "defended by the possibility of revenge" and worried that she would be "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman is now looking to cancel that understanding because she continues to be traumatized by the incident.
At the time of the attack he was accused, Ronaldo was about to move from Manchester United to Real Madrid. This summer, he was transferred to Italian giant Juventus, after a transaction worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain 'will forever regret' the loss of car manufacturers
Britain would "forever regret" if it lost its world leader in automotive production after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it is “concerning” that Toyota UK told the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without an agreement, it will temporarily stop production at its Burnaston factory near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border delays in a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The factory in Burnaston, where Toyota’s Auris and Avensis brands are manufactured, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s chief executive officer at Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, said they feared leaving the EU without a cross-border trade agreement.
BMW, for example, says that after Brexit, it will close the factory in Oxford where the Mini is produced for a month.
The main concerns are created by what manufacturers call the risks associated with the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is based on the “fix on time” principle: for custom-made machines, the parts arrive at 37-minute intervals from suppliers in the UK and the EU.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29, there could be problems at the border, which, according to industrial producers, could cause delays and a shortage of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more of the inventory for a day at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would stop.
Clark said Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future EU relations is “precisely calibrated to avoid these border delays.”
“We want to have the best deal, which will allow us not only to enjoy the success of the moment, but also to take advantage of this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4.
“The evidence coming not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers shows that we need to continue to be able to use what was a very successful supply chain set.”
Toyota has not been able to specify how long production will have to be stopped, but warned that rising prices could reduce the factory’s long-term competitiveness and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the United Trade Union at the factory, said members are increasingly concerned: “Experience has taught me that after they disappear, these jobs don’t come back.”
A government spokesman said: “We have created a precise and credible plan for the future relationship with the EU.”
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump’s high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed another week” as the fight for Brett Kavanaugh, nominated to the Supreme Court, continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein is overseeing special adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia’s interference in the election, ties between Trump’s aid and Russia, and the president’s potential obstruction of justice.
Rumors about Trump's chance to fire the deputy prosecutor general, thereby jeopardizing Mueller's independence, have been circulating in Washington circles for months.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of suspending the president through amendment 25 to the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But he went to the White House last Monday, and reports say he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced for Thursday with Trump, who was at the time at the United Nations headquarters in New York.
Trump said he "would rather not" fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate legal committee hearing, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump called for a one-week FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, which once again postponed the vote in the Senate plenary.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she stated: “It has not yet been set a date for this. It may be this week or it may be postponed by a week, taking into account all the other things that are happening now in the Supreme Court.
But we will see and always like to keep the press up to date.”
Some reporters would challenge this claim: Sanders no longer had a press briefing at the White House on September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the reduction in the number of briefings was not caused by antipathy towards TV reporters who like to perform, although he added: “I do not deny that they like to perform.”
He then suggested that there would be increased direct contact between Trump and the press.
“The president participates in more questions and answers than all previous presidents,” she said, adding, without mentioning any evidence: “We have analyzed the figures.”
"There will still be briefings," Sanders said, but "it seems much better for the press to have an opportunity to address the questions directly to the President of the United States, not to me.
“We’re trying to do this most of the time, and you’ve noticed that we’ve done this many times in the last few weeks, and talks with the president of the United States will replace press briefings when it’s available.”
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with the dignitaries who visit him.
Press conferences given exclusively by him are rare.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated why this is happening, having an improvised appearance, on bizarre allocations, in front of the assembled reporters.
A State Secretary of the Ministry of Health addresses, in a letter, EU employees of the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland on Brexit concerns
The Secretary of State wrote to EU employees working at the Scottish NHS subsidiary to express their gratitude on behalf of the country and their desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter under conditions less than six months before the UK's withdrawal from the European Union.
The Scottish government has already undertaken to bear the costs of applications for permanent resident status for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, the UK-EU withdrawal negotiations continued, awaiting decisions this fall.
But the UK government has begun to prepare more and more for a different scenario, in which there would be no agreement to exit the EU.
I know this is a very stressful time for you.
For this reason, I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues in the European Union, but also outside it, have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and also benefit the patients and communities we serve.
You can consider Scotland your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgical surgery after having suffered a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers founder Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after he suffered a head injury on Saturday, in the match his team lost to Vanderbilt Commodores, scoring 31-27, said Tenke's Organ.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the strike took place shortly before the break.
“He got to the spoon line and just collapsed,” Reed said.
His Abercrombie was put the oxygen mask by physical trainers and medical staff on the spoon line before placing it on a plate and transporting it off the field for a detailed assessment.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the operation he was undergoing at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are still no details about the type/severe extent of the injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it occurred.
Abercrombie, a student in year 2, is in his first season at Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
On Saturday, he managed to make a total of five marks before leaving the game, reaching an 18 marks in the entire season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher court fee when buying a property in the UK.
Foreign buyers will pay a higher court fee on the purchase of a property in the UK, followed by additional money being used to help homeless people, according to the new Conservative Party plans.
This change will neutralize Corbyn’s successful efforts to attract young people with voting rights
The stamp court fee will be applied to persons who are not taxpayers in the UK
Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher court fee when buying a property in the UK, and additional money will be used to help homeless people, as Theresa May announced today.
The change will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young people with the right to vote, promising more affordable homes and targeting high-income people.
The higher stamp court fee will be applied to natural and legal persons who are not taxpayers in the UK, and the additional money thus obtained will be used to support the government’s efforts to help homeless people.
The surcharge, which adds to the current stamp court fee, including the high levels of the last two years for the second property and the properties purchased for rent, could reach a value of 3%.
The Treasury expects this change to bring an extra of up to 120 million pounds a year.
Approximately 13% of newly built properties in London are purchased by non-residents in the UK, leading to price increases and making it difficult for those who want to buy their first home.
Several prosperous areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "fantasy cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers spending much of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a reduction in the stamp court fee to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the large construction companies of keeping property prices high as a result of the purchase of land without using them, and asked Theresa May to give up the fees for affordable homes in order to solve the UK’s “house-related problem”.
Corbyn announced a number of attractive real estate reform proposals, including leasing controls and halting unmotivated evacuations.
He also wants to give the councils greater powers when it comes to building new homes.
Theresa May said: “Last year I stated that I will dedicate my prime minister’s mandate to fulfilling the British dream of a better life for every new generation.
And that means fixing the problems that exist in the real estate market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work, and build a life here.
However, it is not fair that people who do not live in the UK, as well as companies based abroad, can buy homes as easily as British residents who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of owning a house has become one far too far away, and living in unworthy conditions is far too real.”
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to be the manager of Scotland's national team"
Jack Ross, the manager of the Sunderland football team, said his “final goal” was to become, at some point, the manager of Scotland’s national team.
The 42-year-old enjoys the challenge of “returning” the North-East club, which is currently in 3rd place in the Premier League, with a three-point difference from the first place.
He moved to the Light Stadium team this summer after he managed, last season, to return the St. Mirren football team to the first Scottish Premiership division.
“I wanted to be a member of the national football team, but as a player.
We got into the national team B and that’s about that,” Ross told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
“But I spent much of my childhood watching Scotland’s games at Hampden with my father and I always wanted to come back.
But I will only take advantage of this opportunity if I succeed as the club’s manager.”
Among Ross' predecessors as managers of Sunderland club are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former club manager Alloa Athletic said he has no emotion to be the successor to such dedicated names and to such an important club after refusing offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“The only thing that worries me and that could affect my success is the question, ‘Can I help this team get back into the Premier League?’
There is no doubt that the structure and facilities in this club allow him to be in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get her there, but I think the only thing that would make me feel like a successful man is to contribute to the club's return to the Premier League."
Ross has only three years of experience in leadership, after a period where he was assistant manager at Dumbarton and another 15 months spent as a member of the training staff at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover after relegating to Division C and managed to save St. Mirren from relegation, helping the team win the championship the following season.
Ross said he feels better now than in his entire career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was a decisive moment,” he said about taking the lead of Alloa.
“I really thought the role of manager was better for me than the role of player.
Maybe it sounds weird, because we had a good time, we won well, and we had some successful moments.
But it's hard to be a player.
You have to do a lot of things and repeat them weekly.
I face similar situations as a manager when it comes to stress and pressure, but I feel it’s the right role for me.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager and now that I can do that, I feel like it’s the thing that best suits me in my entire adult life.”
You can listen to the entire interview on Sunday, September 30, between 12:00 and 13:00 at the Sportsound show from Radio Scotland.
The ideal time to drink a half beer is Saturday at 5:30 p.m., according to a survey
The heatwave this summer led to an increase in revenues in UK pubs, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
According to figures, pubs and bars saw a 2.7% increase in July, while restaurants revenues fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, the CGA representative who provides business consulting services and who carried out the survey, said: “The constant heat and England’s participation in the World Cup for a longer period than expected contributed to a restaurant pattern in July, similar to that of the previous month, 8% of the time at the previous month.
The number of customers decreased by 1.8% in the restaurant industry in June and declined further in July.
Pubs and bars serving only drinks have made a much higher profit than restaurants.
And pubs serving food have suffered losses due to heat, but not as large as restaurants.
Apparently, people just went out to the city to drink.
“Drink sales across all bars and pubs have increased by 6.6% this month, and food has fallen by 3%.”
Paul Newman, the representative of RSM who provides services in the hospitality industry, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather conditions and the impact of large-scale sporting and social events remain among the most important factors contributing to sales associated with the OOH advertising market.
It is no wonder that restaurants continue to lose, although a 4.8% year-on-year drop in sales will add to current cost pressures.
The long cannibal summer could not come at a worse time for food industry operators and only time will decide whether the more moderate temperatures recorded in August will bring better news.”
The increase in total sales of pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the small number of newly launched locations.
The company that monitors the sales of pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK, the Coffer Peach Tracker, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups with a combined profit of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, the official industry standard.
One in five children has a secret account on a social network they hide from their parents.
According to a survey, one in five children, some even aged up to 11, have a secret account on a social network that they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in “fake Insta” accounts.
Knowledge has heightened fears about posts with sexual content
20% of students say they have a “main” account that they show to their parents.
One in five children, some even aged up to 11, create an account on a social network that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in “fake Insta” accounts, referring to the Instagram photo sharing platform.
Knowledge has heightened fears about posts with sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they have a “main” and “clean” account that they show to their parents, but that they also have other private accounts.
A mother, who accidentally discovered his 13-year-old daughter’s secret account, noticed a teenage boy’s post calling for her to be “violated.”
According to research by the UK’s Digital Awareness company and the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of young people aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, and half of them have secretly admitted that they have their own.
HMC’s director Mike Buchanan said: “It’s alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces that parents and teachers don’t have access to.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the ‘voice of athletes’ in Scotland’s Athlete Commission
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the post of director, without executive power, of the Scottish Athletes Commission, at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated field and track athlete in Scotland, and Ian Beattie, the president, described the change as a great opportunity for those who make decisions about sports to take advantage of the vast experience it has gained internationally in the past.
"Eilidh enjoys respect throughout the community of athletes from Scotland, the UK, as well as around the world, and we are confident that Scottish athletes will have significant benefits with its inclusion in the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle added: “I’m thrilled to be able to represent athletes and I hope to make a real contribution and to help how sports are carried out in Scotland.”
The American nationality athlete, who won 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Games, in addition to the four gold medals won at the Olympics, is now a frequent commentator at the BBC, has remained invalid after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
She wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that only time will decide if I will recover or to what extent.
It was a titanic job, but I recovered completely, I learned to walk again, and today I do agility exercises!
Thank you for your message of encouragement!”
A breast pump ad that compares women to cows divides public opinion in the online environment
A breast pump company has sparked a divide in public opinion in the online environment with an advertisement comparing breastfeeding mothers to cow breastfeeding.
To mark the launch of a pump that wants to be “the world’s first silent and portable breast pump,” consumer technology company Elvie released an ironic advertisement, inspired by a music video, to showcase the freedom that the new pump offers breastfeeding mothers.
Four real moms dance in a pond full of cow's pond on a melody that includes verses like: "Yes, I muggle, but I don't have a tail" and "if you haven't noticed, these are not owls, but my breasts."
“I pump, pump, I breastfeed the baby, pump, pump, I extract milk from the girls.”
However, the ad, posted on the company’s Facebook page, sparked controversy in the online environment.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video was targeted by mixed reactions from those who viewed it, many of which claimed to reveal the “ears” of the dairy industry.
“It was a very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they have to remain pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their children are stolen just a few days after they are born,” a person wrote.

Another person commented: “It is understandable how traumatic it is for both the mother and the child.
Of course, why not use them to promote a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?”
Someone else added: “It’s an extremely inappropriate advertisement.”
Other people defended the ad, a person claiming that he appeared to be a “hilarious” ad.
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping really made me feel like a vampire.
Advertising is a bit inappropriate, but I took it as such.
But the product is great,” one person wrote.
Another person commented: “It’s a funny advertisement that targets mothers who use the pump (often at work or in the toilet) and who feel like ‘wolves’.
It’s not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the group of women reveal that they danced with discreet pumps inserted in braces.
The concept behind the campaign is that many women who use the breast pump say they feel like cows.
But the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and is discreetly fitted into a breastfeeding bra, giving women freedom of movement, the ability to hold their children in their arms and even get out of town while using the pump.
Ana Balarin, partner, consultant and developer in design at Mother, commented: “The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves such a bold and challenging launch.
By comparing breastfeeding mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight what it takes to use a breast pump and the challenges in this regard, presenting, in a fun and real way, the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will give.
It's not the first time Elvie's pump gets to the front page.
During the presentation of fashion designer Marta Jakubowski at London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the podium while using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Have Been Hiddenly Transferred to a Refugee Camp on the Texas Border
The number of migrant children detained has increased, although the number of people who crossed the border each month has remained relatively the same, largely because the Trump administration’s harsh rhetoric and policies have made it harder to place children in sponsorship.
Usually, many sponsors are themselves immigrant without documents and fear that they will endanger their stay in the country if they request to take children.
Risks increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors, as well as other adult family members, had to record their fingerprints and that their data would be communicated to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had requested sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no previous criminal records.
“Approximately 80% of people who are sponsors or members of the sponsors’ family live illegally in the country, and most of them are foreign criminals.
Which means that we will continue to look for those individuals," Albence said.
In order to accelerate the process of processing in the child system, the authorities have introduced new rules, according to which children must appear in court within one month of detention, and not within 60 days as provided for by the previous standard, according to the shelter employees.
Many will appeal for the case through a video call, and not personally before an immigration judge, to apply for legal resident status.
Those who are not eligible will be deported immediately.
The longer children stay in custody, the more they can become restless or depressed, which can lead to violent reactions or attempts to escape, according to shelter employees and reports issued by the system in recent months.
Lawyers said these concerns are accentuated at a larger unit, such as Tornillo, where there is a possibility that signs indicating that a child is having problems are not observed, due to the size of the unit.
They added that transferring children to the refugee camp without giving them enough time for emotional training or to say goodbye to friends could cause them trauma, which many of them already suffer from.
Syria calls for U.S., French and Turkish military forces to retreat immediately
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although Syria is in an eight-year war.
Moualem, who is also the interim prime minister, said foreign military forces are illegally on Syrian territory, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and that “the situation will be properly managed.”
"This must be withdrawn immediately and without any conditions," he said at the assembly.
Moualem insisted that “the war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been derailed from their homes.
He added that Damascus will continue “this sacred struggle until we remove terrorist groups and the illegal foreign presence from all Syrian territories.”
In Syria, there are about 2,000 military troops in the United States, which are mainly engaged in training and advising the Kurdish and Arab forces in Syria that are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
There are also more than 1,000 French troops in the war-torn country.
With regard to the refugee issue, Moualem said there were favorable conditions for their return and accused "a few Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears", which prompted refugees to keep their distance.
He added: “We have requested the support of the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return.”
“Political influences have been brought into a problem that should be purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have issued warnings that they will not support reconstruction in Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition on ending the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a demilitarized zone in the Idlib region to evacuate the last rebel group has created an opportunity to continue political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has helped to avoid a large-scale assault by Syrian forces, supported by Russian forces, on the province in which three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the deal has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action will target jihadist groups, including those on the Nusra front, who are connected to the Al-Qaeda network and who will "be eradicated".
Staffan de Mistura, the United Nations embassy, hopes to meet soon at a first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the ground for elections.
Moualem presented the conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, stating that the committee’s activities should be limited to “revising the articles of the current constitution” and issued a warning regarding interference.
Why Trump Will Win Second Mandate
If we were to follow this logic, Trump would be realistic in 2020, unless the destitution procedure or scandals end his presidency earlier, which a large part of the liberal audience hopes to happen.
In this case, it would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic end of a presidential term of all time!”
So far, it seems that the audience is still interested in the topic.
Since 2014, first-time audiences have doubled at CNN, reaching 1.05 million and nearly tripled at MSNBC, reaching 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, in the early days, the television station Fox News is watched by an average of 2.4 million people, compared to four years ago when it was watched by 1.7 million, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" recorded an audience record, with 3.5 million people following it.
"This is a subject that attracts the public, because we can't understand it," said Neal Baer, producer of ABC's drama series Reserve President, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after a catastrophic attack on the Capitol building.
Nell Scovell, a comedy writer with extensive experience in the field and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride through Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote with Trump.
Why? she asked.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Scovell told me.
In chaos, entertainment is valued.
Of course, unlike anything else broadcast on TV, the action held in Washington could determine the future of the Roe vs. Wade case, if families of immigrants can also be whole about the state of the global economy.
Changing positions is a luxury that only the privileged audience can afford.
However, you’re not just an informed citizen when you arrive at Trump’s sixth hour of viewing the debate by a panel of experts on the way Bob Woodward uses “deep background” sources, “confidential” for his book, “Fear,” about the 5,000-skin jacket of the optopus.
For example, I will never look at Super Mario again in the same way.
“A lot of what it does gives you the feeling that you’re watching a reality show and it feeds you with topics every night,” said Brent Montgomery, executive director of the Wheelhouse Entertainment media group and creator of the “Axis of the Damned” show, about the ever-changing distribution, the challenge of Trump’s face-to-face, and the twists of the situation.
Don’t let yourself miss an episode, because you’ll feel like you’re left behind.
When I went to visit Mike Fleiss this week at his house on the north coast of Kauai Island, there were 27 degrees outside and it was sunshine, and he was sitting inside watching MSNBC and recording on CNN.
They couldn’t stand out from the television, especially as Brett Kavanaugh was going to face the Senate’s legal committee and decide the future of the Supreme Court.
“I remember doing some shows that came out of the ordinary in the past, and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but it seemed like they were right.”

Overwhelming external financial resources for the closest interim elections associated with the House of Representatives
As a result of a realignment of electoral districts, which resulted in two mandate holders in an election race for the same position, it’s no surprise that the Pennsylvania state’s 17th electoral district enjoys overwhelming financial resources.
Thus, the new suburb of Pittsburgh district brought Democratic representative Conor Lamb into the race, who won, in another district, the special elections of last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is now the Pennsylvania’s 12th electoral district, which is significantly overlapping with the 17th.
The electoral maps were reconfigured after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutional, manipulating district boundaries in favor of Republicans.
The race in the 17th new electoral district triggered a competition in funding campaigns between the major party funding bodies, the Congressional Committee for the Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a tight win in a special, high-performance election that took place in March for the state's 18th electoral district.
For more than a decade, the office was occupied by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won in this district by a 20-point difference.
According to political commentators, the Democrats enjoy a slight advantage.
The United States has considered penalizing the state of El Salvador for its agreement with China, but then resigned
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a welcoming meeting with the President of the Republic of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama until the partners evacuated the Trump Organization’s leadership team.
State Department officials have decided to call U.S. heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama as a result of “recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan,” said Heather Nauert, the department’s spokeswoman, in a statement.
But sanctions were only taken against the state of El Salvador, which received US aid worth about <0x24>140 million in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included reductions in financial aid and visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and the high rate of unemployment and crime in Central America.
As domestic meetings have made progress, North and Central American officials have postponed a high-level conference focused on economic security and prosperity to continue a similar meeting last year, seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants heading to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted to continue the conference, effectively ending any review of sanctions for El Salvador.
It is now planned that Vice President Mike Pence will address the conference, scheduled for mid-October, wanting to highlight the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three U.S. ambassadors returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without receiving new messages or harsh penalties from Washington.
A White House spokesman for John Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss domestic deliberations only if their anonymity was maintained.
Their relationships were corroborated by an external analyst, who is a close friend of the administration and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The Study of History
The next thing that could happen is Special Adviser Robert Mueller’s report on the possible obstruction of justice by President Trump, about which there is now strong public evidence.
Mueller also appears to be directing his investigation into the existence of a plot between Trump’s campaign and Russia regarding the U.S. election attack.
If Congress changes, Trump will face appropriate responsibilities within the body, even when he is preparing to appear before the electorate and possibly a jury made up of his colleagues.
There are many possible situations and I don’t want to suggest that a “fall” of Trump is inevitable, as is true for his European counterparts.
There are choices that all of us must make on one side of the Atlantic and that will decide the duration of the investigation.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to give a coup d'état against Hitler, only if the West had opposed him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
I failed and thus missed the opportunity to avoid the years of massacre that followed.
The course of history depends on such critical moments, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are facing such critical moments right now.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since he reported in the newspaper that last year he suggested the president’s secret registration and speculated about his incompatibility with the role of president.
Rosenstein said the Times report was incorrect.
“How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation regarding Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or correct, or if it is confirmed in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail to pass these tests, democracy will have a long winter.
But I don’t think we will fail, after the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my longtime embassy residence.
He survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on the table with swastika.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Rangers player Graham Dorrans is optimistic about the game against Rapid Vienna
On Thursday, the Rangers will be the host team for Rapid Vienna, knowing that the victory in the match against the Austrians, after Spain’s impressive match against Villarreal since the beginning of the month, will place it in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the European League.
A knee injury did not allow midfielder Graham Dorrans to play this season up to Villarreal 2-2, but he believes that the Rangers can use this result in his favor to achieve better performance.
"It was a good point for us, given that Villarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old said.
“We started the game thinking we would get a good result and we won a point.
Probably we could have enrolled at the end, but overall, I think the equal was a correct result.
I think they were better in the first one, and we noticed better in the second one.
Thursday will again be an important evening for Europe.
With a little luck we will get three points, but it will be a difficult game, because they had a good result in the last game played. However, having the support of the supporters, we will certainly feel even more motivated and we will have a positive result.
Last year was clearly a difficult one, taking into account my injuries and the changes at the club, but the situation is better at the moment.
The team is fine and the guys really like to be here; the training goes well too.
Let us hope that we will persevere, that we will leave behind what happened last season and that we will have good results."
Women have insomnia due to retirement savings
Despite the fact that the survey participants clearly knew how to be cared for, few people spoke to family members about it.
Approximately half of the people who participated in the study conducted by Nationwide said they were discussing the cost of long-term care with their husband/wife.
Only 10% of them said they had spoken to their children about this topic.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t initiate this conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance company Nationwide.
Here's how you can start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide the care you need if you don’t make your wishes known in time.
Work with the counselor and family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as these choices could be a significant factor in cost-setting.
Engage your financial advisor: and the financial advisor can be a real help in paying for these expenses.
Your long-term care financing choices can include a standard long-term insurance policy, a mixed cash life insurance policy, to help you cover these expenses, or you can ensure your own well-being – as far as you have the money.
Set up your legal documents: come face to face with issues of a legal nature.
Get a medical decision empowerment to designate a trusted person to supervise your medical care and ensure that the professionals in the field respect your wishes if you can’t communicate them.
Also consider exercising an empowerment with respect to your financial resources.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure your invoices are paid, if you do not have the capacity to do so.
Don’t forget the small details: imagine that a parent of yours at an advanced age has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Take note of these details in a written plan to be prepared.
"And it's not all about the financial side. Can you tell who the doctors are taking care of it?" asked Martin.
“What are the medications?
Who will take care of his dog?
Write a plan for all these things.”

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a severe earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to authorities, and the death toll is expected to increase.
Due to the interruption of communications networks, disaster-care authorities were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala Regency, an area in the north of the city of Palu, which is closest to the epicenter of the 7.5-degree earthquake on the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are some key information about Palu and Donggala, from the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province in the center of Sulawesi Island, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of about 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by a tsunami and earthquake.
Donggala is a regency that extends along a coastline with an area of more than 300 km northwest of Sulawesi Island.
Regenza, an administrative region located under a province, has a population of about 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture activities are the central point of the province's economy in the center of Sulawesi Island, in particular the Donggala coastal region.
Mining activities for nickel extraction are also important in the province, but are concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi Island.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
Also in 1996, a tsunami struck the western part of the Donggala Regency, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Fire Circle, an area with intense seismic activity.
Here are some of the earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: On December 26, a powerful earthquake on the western coast of Indonesian province Aceh, north of Sumatra, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra Island in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-degree magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale struck the south of Indonesia's most populous islands, Java, triggering a tsunami that struck the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-degree magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-degree magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale struck one of the Mentawai islands off the coast of Sumatra Island, triggering a tsunami up to 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: A low-intensity earthquake occurred in the Pidie Jaya Regent in Aceh, causing damage and panic as people recalled the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami, which resulted in a large number of deaths.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people died as a result of buildings collapsed.
2018: Several powerful earthquakes took place on the tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern part of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily trapped under demolitions.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate, Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of violence.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, being involved in a domestic violence complaint and in opposition to arrest, according to a report published Saturday by Alaska police.
According to the police report, when an acquaintance of his female sex tried to call the police to claim the alleged crimes, he picked up his phone.
Palin is in police custody, at the Mat-Su unit, pending trial, and is detained on the basis of a <0x24>500 non-cash fee, according to KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "100% innocent" when his plea was requested, according to the network.
Palin faces three counts of Class A crimes, which means he could be imprisoned for up to a year and fined <0x24>250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B crime, which is sentenced to one day in prison and a <0x24>2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been accused of this.
In December 2017, he was accused of violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to announce the alleged aggression.
The case is pending trial at the Alaska Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, engaging in a complaint of a crime of domestic violence and holding a gun while in a state of drunkenness in connection with an incident.
According to his girlfriend's statement, he gave him a punch in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after her son’s violent behavior was associated with the post-traumatic stress syndrome he suffers from after being part of the Iraqi military.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake on the Richter scale triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and telecommunications networks are damaged and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The quake occurred in the outskirts of central Sulawesi province, located in the northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
On social networks there are videos showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
Federal Prosecutor Wants Death Penalty for Suspect of Terrorist Attack in New York City
New York’s federal prosecutor’s office wants capital punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspected terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people, a rare punishment that has not been imposed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, apparently used a rented Home Depot truck to carry out an attack on a bicycle track on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists on his trail in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed the eight victims and “intentionally” caused serious bodily injuries, according to the intentional opinion on the request for capital punishment filed in New York’s South District.
Both heads of charges may receive a capital sentence, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a high-ranking federal jury charged Saipov with 22 head of indictment including eight charges of organized crime, usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, as well as a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “substantial planning and premeditation,” prosecutors said, describing how Saipov executed the act as “hateful, cruel and depraved.”
"Sayfullo Habibulaevic Saipov caused injuries, suffering and losses to the families and friends of the following people: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last trial of a case of capital punishment in New York's South District.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was accused of killing two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last federal death penalty imposed in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, two husbands executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
Rosenberg's wives were executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the court documents, Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, showed no regrets in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators that he was happy with what he did, according to police.
Saipov told authorities he felt inspired to carry out the attack after watching the ISIS group’s videos on his phone, according to the whistleblower.
According to police, he also asked to arrange the ISIS flag in the hospital room.
He pleaded innocent with respect to the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the attorneys at the office who represented Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to apply the capital punishment, rather than accepting a life-long jail sentence, with no possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all people involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team has previously asked the prosecutor not to apply the capital punishment.
A member of Parliament who is part of the Conservative Party argues that NIGEL FARAGE should be at the forefront of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today promised to “mobilize the civilian army” during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
Ukip’s former leader said politicians should “feel the pressure” from Eurosceptics, following a statement by a member of parliament Theresa May who suggested that he should be at the forefront of negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at a demonstration in Birmingham that the UK "would have left" by now if Farage was Secretary of the Brexit campaign.
But the challenge May faces with regard to extremely divided camps was accentuated by members of the Conservative Party who joined another protest against leaving the European Union organized in the city.
The prime minister is trying in return for his compromise plan, the so-called Chequers plan, to proceed properly, confronting the attacks on the part of those who support leaving the European Union, those who want to remain in it, as well as on the part of the European Union.
The Allies have stressed that it will continue to try to conclude an agreement with Brussels, regardless of the consequences, and will force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between its offer and “chaos”.
Bone said during the pro-Brexit “Leave Means Leave” event in Solihull that he wanted “the resignation from the Chequers plan.”
He suggested that Farage should be part of the team and be given the responsibility associated with the negotiations with Brussels.
“If things were led by him, I was no longer in the European Union,” he said.
The Conservative Member of Parliament, the Wellingborough Circuit, added: "I will support Brexit, but we have to give up the Chequers plan."
Referring to his opposition to the European Union, he said: “We have not fought in world wars to be servants.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone denied suggestions about changing public opinion in the 2016 vote: “It is not at all true that the British have changed their minds and that they want to stay in the Union.”
Andrea Jenkyns, a member of the Conservative Party that supports Brexit, also went to the demonstration and told reporters: “I just want to say this: Prime Minister, listen to the voices of the people.
“The public does not agree with the Chequers plan, the opposition will not vote for it, our party does not agree with him and our activists who go out to the streets and support us, first of all, in elections.
Give up the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a message addressed to Theresa May, she added: “The prime ministers who keep their positions are the ones who keep their promises.”
During the rally, Nigel Farage said politicians should be put in a position to “feel pressure” if they are about to quit the 2016 referendum decision.
“It’s a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They try to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them that we’re not going to let them do that.”
In a message to enthusiastic thanks, he added: “I want you to help us put pressure on our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
“We are mobilizing the civilian army of the country that brought us victory in Brexit and we will not give up until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, those who support the stay in the European Union marched through Birmingham ahead of a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small group of activists raised banners that wrote “The Conservative Party is against Brexit” after the group’s launch this weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, laughed at members of the Conservative Party and the security issues they faced in the party's application at the start of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us they can implement IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus, for the digitalization of customs procedures, for free and unrestricted trade in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a farce.
“Brexit does not bring any benefits,” he added.
Warren plans to seriously think about running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider running for president after the November election.
According to the Boston Globe newspaper, Massachusetts' Democratic senator spoke on Saturday about her future during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, runs to be realistic in the November election against Geoff Diehl, a member of the Republican Party's House of Representatives, who was co-chair of Donald Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She was at the center of speculation that she could defeat Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was the 36th meeting with voting citizens using the city's format since Trump took office as president.
One participant asked her if she was going to run for office.
Warren replied that it was time for “women to come to Washington to solve the problems of our heavily affected government, and this includes a woman at his head.”
A suspect has been arrested in the case of the death of the Sims player from the LSU team
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, said on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested for the death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at an ET press conference at 11:00.
They posted a video of Friday's shooting, asking for help identifying the man in the pictures.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the campus of Southern University on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head, causing his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was on the spot, that he was in possession of a weapon, but also that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to police custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a junior player with a height of 1.98 m, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 matches, being 10 times in the initial lot in the last season and playing, on average, 17.4 minutes, with 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins world title after his team helps him win in front of Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the orders given by the Mercedes team will play an essential role in the race.
Standing first in the rankings, Bottas had a good start and almost defeated Hamilton, defending his position in the first two rounds and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to stop at the box and left Hamilton at the tail of the group, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes stopped at the box a lap later and came behind Vettel, but Hamilton managed to advance after a few schemes that forced the Ferrari driver to leave the interior free after making a double move to defend himself in the third lap.
Max Verstappen started the race in the back of the carriage and was in seven spots near the end of the first round, the day he turned 21.
Then he was in the lead for much of the race, aiming for a quick end and trying to overcome Kimi Raikkonen and take fourth place.
Finally, he stopped at the boxing table in the 44th round, but was unable to step up in the last eight rounds, leaving Raikkonen in fourth place.
“It was a difficult day, Valtteri did an exceptional job all weekend and he behaved like a real gentleman, letting me go ahead.
And the team has done an excellent job of achieving victory over Ferraris and achieving this double," Hamilton said in a statement.
A terrifying body language
President Donald Trump ironized Senator Dianne Feinstein on Saturday at a rally on her insistence that she did not facilitate the "escape" of the letter of Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Brett Kavanaugh, nominated to the Supreme Court, of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, commenting instead that what is happening in the Senate showed that people are “live, immoral and lying.”
“The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that happens in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and bad and immoral and liars,” he said.
“When you see that they have published and circulated information and then they say they didn’t.
They're not the ones responsible.
Do you remember?
When did I ask Dianne Feinstein if she facilitated the document's "escape"?
Do you remember her answer? She said, umm..poftim?
Aaah... no.
I didn't do that."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we do this?..No, I didn’t,” he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford in July and was "broken" in September, but Feinstein denied that the "escape" took place from her office.
"I have not concealed the allegations that concern Ford and I am not the one who facilitated the 'escape' of her story," Feinstein told the committee, according to the Hill newspaper.
“He asked me to keep it confidential and that’s exactly what I did.”
But her denial does not seem to have been well-written by the president, who commented during Saturday’s rally: “To be honest, it was a terrible body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it was the most awful body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing the defense of the Supreme Court candidate, who was accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use the accusations to achieve their own goals.
“They are determined to take power in any way possible.
Observe evil, immorality, don’t care who they hurt and who they have to destroy in order to gain power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee's Stars team wins 5-3 ahead of Belfast's Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars team paid for Friday's loss to the Elite League, winning against the Belfast Giants in Saturday's return game, scoring 5-3 in Dundee.
The Giants team had a two-goal lead, the shots being executed by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie scored before Dwyer brought the Giants back in front of the opposing team.
Francois Bouchard scored for Dundee before two goals scored by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League this season for Adam Keefe's players, who had regained ground by defeating the Dundee team 2-1 on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, the Giants winning the last three games.
Dwyer's opening performance kicked off in the fourth minute, 3:35, from a pass by Kendall McFaull, then David Rutherford switched decisively to Beauvillier, who doubled the team's lead four minutes later.
In a match that started so dynamically, Sullivan returned the host team to the game in the 13:10 minute, before Matt Marquardt gave Cownie the opportunity to sign for an equal score in the 15:16 minute.
Dwyer secured the advantage of the Giants before the first break, when he scored his second goal at the end of the first relay.
The host team regrouped and Bouchard scored again with an impressive goal in the minute 27:37.
Later, in the second rebound, Cownie and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen get an advantage for Dundee for the first time in that match, thereby ensuring the team climbed to 5th place in the rankings, in the middle of the last rebound.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five matches, will host Milton Keynes in their next match on Friday.
Aerial traffic controller dies after securing landing a plane with hundreds of passengers during an earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is considered a hero, after he died after securing the safe take-off of a plane with hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a powerful earthquake struck Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Several powerful replicas took place in the area and many people are locked under the remains of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save his life, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post from the control tower of the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu, which was heavily swamped.
It remained in place to ensure that Batik Air’s flight 6321, which was on the track at the time, would take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the aerial control tower when he noticed that it was about to collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Indonesia's air navigation service provider said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News Australia.
I've prepared a helicopter has to transport it from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to a larger hospital from another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning, before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“We are saddened by this news,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, with the national disaster management agency stating that access is limited in the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
“We believe that the number will increase because many victims are still in ruins and we have not had access to many of them,” said the agency’s spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves of up to six meters in height devastated the city of Palu, with a common funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute, an ambulance brings victims.
It is almost impossible to find drinking water.
All mini-markets are stolen.”
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find on the spot.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the national army: "Please work day and night to carry out all evacuation operations.
“Are you ready?” he told CNN.
Indonesia was crushed earlier this year by the Lombok quake, which killed more than 550 people.
Air crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says a person is missing after a plane crashes into a lagoon
The airline that owned the plane that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia has now declared that a person is missing, after previously stated that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane sinking.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger has been missing since Saturday afternoon.
She also said she was trying to find the man, along with local authorities, hospitals and investigators.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats were used to retrieve other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, authorities said seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
It is not yet known what caused the accident and the exact order of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane missed the landing track and reached a lagoon near it.
Some witnesses believe the plane has crossed the end of the track.
Passenger of American nationality Bill Jaynes said the plane had reached a very short distance from the ground.
“It’s a very good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes also said that he and other passengers were able to cross the water, which had reached the bridge, and reach the emergency exits of the plane that was sinking.
He also said that his companions were panicking and screaming and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to renovate a lander jumped in aid, using an inflatable boat to transport people to shore before the plane sank 30 meters underwater.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in PNG-registered airline crashes in the last two decades, but none of them included an Air Niugini plane.
Analyst presents the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor’s office closed its plea for the resumption of trial for a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert witness in information analysis.
He presented to the jury how he used the cell phone records to put Quinton Tellis' 29-year-old actions to the head, as well as his victim, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said she received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed, contradicting his earlier claims, according to the Clarion Ledger newspaper.
When the data revealed that his cell phone was with Chambers when he said it was with his friend, Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was summoned to the witness box and confessed that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked Tellis if he was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he "lied because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis stated that she had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Records on mobile phones indicate that they had known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact details from his phone.
“He wiped it out of his life,” Hale said.
According to the schedule, the defense will begin its final plea on Sunday.
The judge said he anticipated that the jury would decide at the end of the day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A trio that plays hip-hop music wants to change the negative way this kind of music is seen, using positive messages.
The High Breed, in Bristol, claims that hip-hop has stopped transmitting political messages and addressing social issues, as it did initially.
They want to go back to their origins and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
A recent rebirth of artists such as The Fugees and Common in the UK has been observed through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another person of color?!
A New York midwife sues a couple for firing her after receiving a "racist" text message
A New York midwife is prosecuting a couple for dismissal for discriminatory reasons after accidentally receiving a text message from her mother complaining that she was “another person of color.”
The couple denied that they were racist, claiming that she had sued them for “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her dissatisfaction when she learned that her new stepmother, Giselle Maurice, was colorful when she presented herself on her first day at work in 2016.
"NOW! EVEN A PERSON OF COLOUR," Plasco-Flaxman wrote to his husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing the ghetto, feeling embarrassed, Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, claiming that the midwife, who is African-American, did not properly perform her duties and that she expected the New York Post to receive a suitable midwife from a national.
Maurice was paid for the workday and sent home with Uber.
Now, she sues the couple to pay compensation for the dismissal and demands the sum of <0x24>350 a day for six months, the period in which she had to live with them and carry out her work, despite the fact that this was done without a contract at all.
“I want to show them that these things are not done,” she told the Post newspaper on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple denies claims that they are racist, saying it was normal to fire Maurice because they feared they could no longer trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent me a wrong message.
He's not a racist person.
We are not racist people," her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But did you leave your children in the hands of someone you have wronged, even if it was wrong?
The newborn baby?
Let's be serious."
Considering the trial as an act of “extortion,” Plasco said that his wife will be born in two months and that she is in a “very difficult situation”.
“Do you really want to take revenge on a person under these circumstances?
This is not the case,” the bank investor added.
While the trial is ongoing, public opinion has accused the couple on social media, judging them for the behavior and logic they have proved.
Publishers in Paddington’s story were afraid readers would not be able to identify with a speaking bear, according to a new letter.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after accepting the book, said the following about the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the skin of a person who reads it for the first time, before it's published.
It’s really funny now, after I saw Paddington had a huge success.”
He also said that his father, who was a BBC cameraman before being inspired by a toy bear to write the children's book, was optimistic about the rejection of his work, adding that the anniversary of the 60th anniversary of the publication of the three-year-old was optimistic.
About Paddington, whom she describes as “a very important member of our family,” she added that her father had a discreet pride in the success she enjoyed afterwards.
“He was a fairly quiet man and he didn’t like to brag,” she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was like having a child who had a success: you’re proud of him, though it’s not your success.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation, based on his imagination, he always gave Paddington the credit."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye by phone
At landing, her daughter was quickly transported to Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nad calls frequently to tell me it’s very serious and he doesn’t think he’s going to survive,” Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got a call from Nad telling me she’s going to die in the next two minutes and that I have to say goodbye to her.
And that's exactly what I did.
I said, “Tashi, my dear, I love you very much.
We'll be together soon.
I'll join you.
The effect of medications given by doctors to keep her heart pumping blood began to diminish and get out of her body.
He died a short time ago and the organs were no longer functioning.
I had to sit there and wait, conscious of everything that was going on.
I couldn’t cry or scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to control myself."
Eventually, Ednan-Laperouse, saddened by the death of his daughter, boarded a plane with other passengers who did not know what he was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“I kept my head down and my tears didn’t stop running.
It’s hard to explain, but during the flight I had a tremendous feeling of sympathy for Nad.
I realized that she needed love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Two Compassionate Women Place Various Messages On A Bridge To Prevent Suicide
Two women who have lost their loved ones because they have committed suicide try to prevent other people from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place various messages on a bridge in Wales, many of which are motivating and include phone numbers that people can call to get support.
Sharon Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parents to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
Davis, 45, lives in Lydney and says his son was going to be a promising cook with a smiling smile.
“Everyone appreciates his smile.
They always said that his smile would change your mood.”
However, he quit his job before dying, because he had arrived at a very unhappy moment in his life.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found his brother after taking his own life.
Davis said, “I still think you’ll have a domino effect.”
This created the messages “to convey to people that they can call someone or that they can sit and talk to someone, even a friend.
Externalize yourself, you need to talk to someone.”
Kelly Humphreys, Davies's longtime girlfriend, lost Mark, his 15-year-old partner, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t tell me he wasn’t feeling well or that he was depressed,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, I noticed that he had changed his attitude.
She was in a deplorable state on Christmas Day, when the kids took away their presents and didn’t even look them in the eye.”
She said his death was a huge trauma for them, but he must overcome it: “He caused a huge pain in the family.
We're devastated.
But we have to go further and fight.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is at stake as a result of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
“I thought that if we could get something similar to what he was asking for — a limited time and a small investigation — we could have little unity,” Jeff Flake said on Saturday, adding that he fears the commission is about to “disintegrate” against the backdrop of a blockade.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their reticence is entirely due to the temporal factor.
There are only five weeks left until the November 6 election - if, as expected, Republicans have poor results, their attempts to place the one they want to win in the country's highest court election will be significant.
George W. Bush always made calls to senators to convince them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI finalizes the report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to make a difference in the case of equality and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean refugees falls under Kim’s leadership
The number of North Korean refugees in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea’s unification ministry, said last year about 1,127 people had fled the country, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the key factors were stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs perceived by those who illegally transport people across the border.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
A vast majority of refugees from the North are eventually granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul officials say more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two parts of Korea.
China considers refugees more illegal than refugees, and often repatriates them forcibly.
Relations between North and South, which are still practically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for several talks on denuclearization negotiations.
This took place after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed, in general terms, to cooperate for a Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused that the US sanctions had caused the lack of progress since.
“If we can’t trust the United States, we won’t be able to trust our national security, and in such situations, in no case will we be the first to disarm unilaterally,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi describes Brett Kavanaugh as "hysterical", declaring he is unable to serve in the Supreme Court.
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the Democratic minority in the House of Representatives, described Brett Kavanaugh, nominated to the Supreme Court as "hysterical" and said his temperament was inappropriate for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks on Saturday in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help thinking that if she was a woman in this situation, she would have been declared 'hysterical'," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate legal committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied allegations of sexually harassing Christine Blasey Ford when she was a teenager.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes almost screaming and losing his voice due to emotions, while discussing his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats in the committee, calling the allegations against him “a grotesque and coordinated assassination of character” organized by angry liberals that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believes Kavanaugh’s testimony proved he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he showed he had a biased character against Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and how he attacked the Clinton family and the democracies,” she said.
Pelosi deviated from the subject when asked if she would try to suspend Kavanaugh if it would be confirmed and whether Democrats would win a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I just want to say this: if he doesn't tell the truth in front of Congress or the FBI, then it's not right, not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court he's in right now," Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge at the Court of Appeal in the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Accessible Care Act or the Roe vs. Wade case, as she is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh ignored the question of whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the right time for a hysterical, partial person to go to court and wait for us to say, ‘Wow, how wonderful!’” Pelosi said.
And women need to be able to handle it.
It’s a justified diatribe, it’s months and years of accumulated anger and it can’t talk without bursting into tears.
“We cry when we get angry,” Gloria Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s unusual, do I?”
She continued, “I received significant help from a woman in executive office, who told me that she was crying when she was nervous, but that she developed a technique by which, when she was angry and started to cry, she said that she was going to say to the person that she was going to cry.
I'm nervous."
And then go on.
I thought it was a great thing.”
Tears are allowed to exteriorize anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories of one of my first jobs, in a men-dominated office, where I started to cry because of an inexpressible burglary, is that I was caught up by an older woman, a cool director at home, and I felt a bit scared of everything.
“They never have to see you crying,” she told me.
“I don’t know you’re angry.
I think you’re sad and they’ll be glad they caused you that feeling.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat in Congress in Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Hart was arrested for having an extramarital relationship on a boat called Monkey Business and retired from the race, Schroeder, extremely frustrated, thought she had no reason not to even run for office.
“It wasn’t a very well thought out decision,” she says, laughing, 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another one.
Some have referred to the situation as “White as Snow and the Seven Monkeys.”
Since the campaign was over, she was behind fundraising and swore she wouldn’t enter the race if she couldn’t raise <0x24>2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of her supporters who gave the men <0x24>1,000, they only gave her <0x24>250.
"Do they think I'm getting discounts?" she asked.
During the speech in which he announced that he would not officially launch a company, she was so affected by emotions – as a result of gratitude for the people who supported her, the system-induced frustration and the fact that it was so difficult to raise money – but it was too difficult to raise money and to target voters instead of delegates.
“You’d have said I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls about the press’s reaction to it.
“You would have said that one of my sponsors is Kleenex.”
I remember thinking about what they would write on my gravestone.
“A cry?”
How can the trade war between the United States and China be beneficial to Beijing?
The bailouts that announced the beginning of the trade war between the United States and China were astonishing and, although it seems to be still a long way to end, disputes between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by imposing taxes on key imports from China, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation occurred this week with new taxes, which affected <0x24>200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) in products, applying, in effect, taxes to half of all Chinese goods arriving on the territory of the United States.
Beijing has repeatedly avenged itself, most recently imposing a tax of between 5% and 10% on <0x24>60 billion worth of U.S. goods.
China has warned it will respond to every blow by the United States and it is unlikely that the world’s second largest economy will take a step back in the near future.
In order for Washington to step down, China must agree with its demands, but publicly surrendering to the United States would be far too humiliating for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, U.S. trade war pressures could positively support China in the long run, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision taken in Washington or Beijing could lead to an economic collapse in both countries would actually be more dangerous than expected so far,” said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher who focuses on Asia at the New American Security Group.
Syria is ready for refugee return, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and demands help to rebuild the country devastated by a seven-year war.
During his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country is improving.
“Today, the conditions on the ground are more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists so that things return to normal.
The existing conditions allow the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and lives.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war broke out in 2011.
Six million people who continue to live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be happy to receive aid in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that conditional assistance or assistance from countries sponsored by the insurgency will not be accepted.
European team wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup after defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National from the outskirts of Paris, France.
The United States has now recorded its sixth consecutive victory in Europe and has never won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe came back in first place after the team led by Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who made incredible efforts for much of the tournament, sent the ball from the initial water kick to the 3rd hole at goal 16, giving the game to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has had an incredible performance in all replays, becoming one of the four players with a score of 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament, since 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost in the 5th and 4th holes to last-place player in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
World top-flight player Dustin Johnson lost to England’s Ian Poulter in 2 and 1 goals, probably his last Ryder Cup match.
A Ryder Cup veteran who participated in eight editions, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the most-victory player in Europe, scoring an average of 25.5 points throughout his career.
“I’m not used to crying, but I can’t stand today.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas that he chose me and that he believed in me.
I am very happy that I was able to win the cup again.
It’s a team job and I’m happy that we could have been able to help,” Garcia said, excited after the European victory.
He handed over the batsman to his cousin, John Ram, who defeated Tiger Woods, an American golf legend, at the 2nd and 1st holes at the individual game on Sunday.
“I’m very proud that I beat Tiger Woods, and I used to watch his games when I was a kid,” Rahm, 23, said.
Woods has lost all four games in France and now holds a 13-21-3 record in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, who won 14 major titles, being surpassed only by Jack Nicklaus.
Throughout the weekend, the American team made a real effort on the golf course, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played extraordinary throughout the tournament.
American team captain Jim Furyk said after his team’s disappointing performance: “I’m proud of them, they really did their best.
This morning, there were a few moments when we put pressure on the European team.
We've had a cranial fight.
Put the hat down for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We'll regroup. I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll go further.
I love these 12 boys and am proud to be their captain.
We have to give them proper respect.
They played better than us.”
