I went to Boston by car.
If you change your mind, you know where to find it.
I don't like dogs.
We just had lunch.
It's just an emergency.
There's yogurt in the refrigerator.
The argument has no power.
Do you have a lighter?
He didn't drown in the pool.
They're watching.
God will help us.
Remember him.
Laughing is really good for you.
Would you like to repeat, please, where did you put the key?
I'll do it.
We'll be there.
Thomas is the group leader.
That's what I want.
I have to beat Tom.
I don't think they like it.
Tom was very excited from within.
I didn’t want to live in a big city from the beginning.
They've got rabbits.
Tom always leaves his bike dirty.
I can't just leave.
Looks like you've been thinking about everything.
That day, my life changed.
Are people a part of nature?
You need to be careful.
You know I don't like eggs.
I wish I had a car.
Tommy couldn't help Marin.
Does anyone know Tomi's family name?
I was trying to stop the intrusive crying.
My wife's family is very wealthy.
Tell Tominak I'll be back.
Get out of here!
Someone broke the glass.
Tom, open a sliced!
The boy held a mouse in his hand by the wolf.
I want to go there.
I would like to express my gratitude to you for your great work.
We hope you don't.
Your French language proficiency has improved a lot.
Tom won't believe a word from what you're saying to him.
Tomi got five on the exam.
Tom's word is against Mari's word.
I don't have time to talk now.
Have you ever been to Mexico?
Coffee at home.
Respect can't be purchased.
Tom smiled.
Tom's freaked out.
You never should have gone early.
This book is used in Spanish.
Health is more important than wealth.
That's exactly what Tom told me.
I'm hungry.
I'm not talking to Tom.
I think every fat person should have a diet.
What do we do first?
- I don't know, I'll call you and ask you.
Can you suggest a different date?
I gave up too early.
What are you going to do there?
That's totally normal.
What else?
Let me go first.
Tomi left for about 30 minutes.
All right.
Let's try it.
Tom insisted that he pay for the dinner.
Take a slice of cake.
I need a watch.
Samuel Hadar.
I like to travel alone.
That's not what we want.
My guitar is in the trunk of the car.
We sat there.
The glass collapsed and collapsed.
Everybody's scared.
That's right.
I don't have a computer.
Tom's not full.
The former tenants left the place in a mess.
Kiss me.
The theory is completely out of reality.
Some people look down on others just because they have less money.
The witch cursed the poor little girl.
Tom didn't show much interest.
Your work's done.
I want to pay now.
I'd like to ask you something.
I've answered the question.
Mary solved the mystery.
Do you have any water?
How can I stop Tom?
Tom's just here.
I usually eat at home with my family.
You shouldn't have done that.
We can't prove anything.
You can skate on that hill.
Tom was drunk, so Mary took him home by car.
I don't speak Hungarian.
The party organised by Tom was a huge success.
Tom was a puppy.
We saw a castle in front of us.
Have you seen Tom when he wakes up?
Tom was surprised, too.
I often go swimming in the river.
Don't worry about them, you're just a bunch of idiots.
I'm sorry I went to Australia.
They do the same things I did when I was a kid.
That's great!
I fell off the ladder.
Mary went to the gym class.
The report was prepared in a hurry and there were a number of spelling errors.
Tom is neither rich nor famous.
Everyone was distracted.
Tom's in the criminal records.
I'll be in Boston tomorrow night.
He invited me personally.
I have to go out.
I'm looking for some food.
He can't stop it.
I learned so much about Tom.
I need a job right away.
Everyone's still sleeping.
Dog-shooting.
Tom decided to go home early.
That was our biggest problem.
You're very kind.
I'm deaf too.
I'm so proud of my team.
Sit back.
I don't know where I am.
Tom didn't do anything.
He's very proud of his talent.
Have you ever lived in a long distance relationship?
All the passengers were transported from the plane.
I need a red pen.
He didn't know what to do with the problem.
I'm thirsty now.
My dad's going to work on a bike.
Where's Tommy now?
Don't be so emotional.
I run eight miles a day.
I never understood Tom.
We had to be there.
Tom made breakfast.
He is undoubtedly the smartest student in the class.
You should've called the cops.
I'll keep it a secret.
Tom hasn't flew a plane yet.
You got your coffee out.
I couldn't have done better.
Tom became a member of this club three years ago.
The item on my watch is so small that I can't replace it.
Quickly go home!
I'm not a dilis.
You've found my cat.
I thought Tom was coming.
Anyone who loves flowers can't be a bad person.
Einstein says everything is relative.
The old book was shabby.
Only for adults.
It's about as tall as you.
Honestly, Tom.
It's important to help those in trouble.
You can no longer teach your old dog new tricks.
I have to release the steam.
I love the Occitan language.
I understand what you mean.
There's something to do.
Tell her you love her before it's too late.
Would you lend me the book when you're done with it?
I've already told you this.
It would cause a catastrophic accident in the workplace.
What do you think of my theory?
Give me some time to figure out what's gone wrong.
Tom is not afraid of death.
We don't have enough information.
I'm far from home.
The bus started as well.
It is the largest lake in Turkey.
The radio's broken.
There are no houses on the other side of the road.
Anyway, you have to wait for the line...
I can't speak Turkish.
Tom looked at his pockets.
The rain got even heavier.
Tom's doing it to everyone.
Are you logged in?
We'll change that soon.
I don't want to talk about the weather.
My request has been rejected.
We were surprised to hear the news.
Don't underestimate yourself.
I'm Antonio.
I met my friend here.
I travelled all over Russia.
I like to piss Tom off.
Tom is our son.
He's a stranger.
You can't know the truth.
Tom is also enraged by the lightest critical remark.
Believe it or not, that's the truth.
I went without him.
He loves his brother.
Where else would we go?
If you don't like it, you can leave.
Tom's gonna pay.
I got it.
Tom was just bored.
I don't want to see him.
Serve yourself if you want to eat anything.
Dad's still in bed.
Do you have to work on Sundays?
We're feeling good.
So far we haven't had any problems.
What color is your hair?
In the chair where you're sitting, I was sitting yesterday.
You're not charitable.
I hope Tommy understands.
Do you believe in ghosts?
I thought I could trust you.
The noise woke up.
Compassion is for the poor.
The snow covered the whole city overnight.
I'll explain later.
Honestly, I don't really care.
Autumn is the best holiday season.
Tom's gone?
They called the veterinarian because there was no other doctor in the village.
I know what I want.
Don't let him swim.
Believe in yourself.
You work on Monday?
How much is your commission?
The dean shook hands with the graduates.
I live in Milan.
Tom can come at any time.
I think time will solve this problem.
Why did your T-shirt go down?
I'd rather stay home and watch TV.
Tom's a Christian?
Ask Thomas to explain it.
You broke up.
I slept by an open window because of the heat.
The sun's gone.
He lost his umbrella again.
Let's go to the movies.
I want to fight!
A Nazi killed a Jew.
We don't know exactly.
If you want to get out of here alive, listen to me!
Instead of German, we learned French.
It's wonderful!
Is that what everyone wants?
You're messing with me?
You can't believe a word.
I love the Spanish!
I'm gonna go for a walk to blow my head off.
A little work doesn't hurt anyone.
A chain is as strong as the weakest eye.
You call me often.
I'm going to apply for work today.
I'm trying to keep up-to-date.
Tom said Mary was Canadian.
My father traveled to Greece.
I have a lot of knowledge of Berber.
The king destroyed his enemies.
You're talking!
I want Mary to leave Tom, let him finish it.
I'm exhausted.
We have a big problem.
You're too drunk to drive.
Her eyes were reddened from crying.
You're going there without me.
Tom's going to be hungry.
It's not a secret.
I was wrong about that.
Take it, please.
We'll do it together.
Can you help me, please?
Tom saw Mary smiling.
You're about to get to the eight-hour train.
He was seen as a hero because he saved his friend's life.
Your father would be proud of you, too.
Just a few seconds, please.
I don't understand why I love Tom so much.
Tominak has a sharp vision.
He promised me he'd come at four.
I don't want to miss this game.
The education system is changing.
There they are.
Hey, guys.
Tom ate a dish.
I don't want to wake up.
Thomas thought that Mary had financial problems.
When I hear the news, I'll be skinny. How can there be such a dangerous thing?
He couldn't resist temptation.
Why do we have to deal with what happens after we die?
We need to help each other.
Someday my dream will come true.
He spent all the money I gave him.
We used to be neighbors.
You think I should tell Tom?
What's that for you?
Do you know how to do this?
My dad's a doctor.
How old is your dad?
I don't have a nickname.
Who likes Tom?
Kill Tom!
I think I'm dying.
What's it for?
Tom's got a wrinkle on his forehead.
We're relaxed.
You're smarter than you think.
Did you see my camera?
Tom did a lot of great things.
I was really busy.
Everything has limits.
Don't be smart anymore.
You're gonna pay for that.
It would be nice to have a collection of the last words of famous people at our disposal.
I'm a social worker.
The ceremony was stunning.
I believe your words.
Is it different?
Tom has as many servants as he needs.
Tom wants to be successful.
Nothing's happened.
Were you in the library last afternoon?
I like you better than him.
He wrote 10 books, but none of them were published.
Tom's home with his parents.
I don't really want to eat now.
Tom was happy with his success.
They didn't find anyone.
You can do this for yourself.
It doesn't take much time.
I hate lawyers.
Tom said you hate dancing.
If you have time, why don't you look into his gallery?
At first I was nervous, but then I gradually calmed down.
I don't want to buy this kind of couch.
You have to ask Tom first.
Explain it to me.
I'm aware of the difficulties.
I'm not sick.
Where are you from, Karen?
It was frozen somewhere in the mountains.
Tom went in that direction.
Tom poured milk into his cat's tray.
I feel like something awful is going to happen.
Is that it?
Tom's not married.
There's no one there.
We were enemies.
Tom frightened Mary.
I had no idea you didn't speak French.
I had two dogs.
They have absolutely different opinions than I do.
We can't save everyone.
Tom's sitting.
Where is the moon when it is not in the sky?
This is one of the best places in town.
All I need is a correction.
Tom was supposed to be an actor.
I ignored it.
It broke the barrier, and the water flooded the valley.
You look so slippery.
Bring her in.
I'm helping Thomas.
I made a lot of money in the presence.
I'm gonna tell Tom what to say to Marin.
I haven't eaten yet.
I'll accept your terms.
I'm a good cook.
It's dangerous!
Can I open my eyes now?
The car is blue.
I've been sick, I've been home all day.
Tom was born in Boston.
Can you wait a second?
Spiders have eight legs.
I'm still a kid.
Tom looks down on the women.
That's ugly.
I work as a bus driver.
I think you know him.
That'll be enough.
We didn't have dinner.
I'm finally smashing you.
I'm going to pass the message to Tominak.
Mari was too shy to admit her feelings.
Tom should've done a lot better.
Which songs were sung?
I'm going home to Boston.
Now or not yet?
Mr. Harrison sat on his porch with a lug, with a devil's finger in his thumb, and squeezed the night's whistle.
I don’t like to study French today.
Tom's very messy.
Go, but without me.
I was crazy to trust Tomi.
What kind of beer is it?
That was a secret.
I trust him.
You're lucky to see a star.
Japan has diplomatic relations with China.
My parents are no longer alive.
Not all black and white.
You don't have the right to judge these people.
He's clearly pissed.
Tom and Mary were ordered the same.
That's what we're discussing.
Wouldn't you come shopping with me?
Water is not healthy.
Can you break an egg with one hand?
Tom has a twin brother.
He's here to protect you.
It looked like Tom was very worried.
There's blood in his puck.
There's a book on the table.
It is important that we spread our language in every possible way.
When will the next train start?
Sometimes I don't understand him.
Anytime, you can ask me anything.
I love you.
This isn't your hat, is it?
Tom doesn't have to talk to me if he doesn't want to.
You can go home now.
It's just an empty threat.
In front of our house are two old gingerbread trees.
They screamed.
The snowflakes crawled on long blond hair.
I don't recognize anyone in the picture.
I hope we're not causing you any discomfort.
Let's talk about it outside.
Thomas is studying chemistry.
He keeps his word.
I'm not counting on any special treatment.
His old friends turned away from him.
Tom didn't put enough sugar in my coffee.
I'm sure I won't pass the exam tomorrow.
The sentence's fine.
The new furniture has arrived today.
Lora! Lora!
I've never seen anything like that in my life.
I'll call Tom right now.
I broke up with my girlfriend.
I hope things will be all right.
Paul's clock is accurate.
He replaced the butter with Margarine.
It was popular in the 1990s.
Everybody did.
Are people like goldfish in the aquarium?
I live in a small house not far from here.
Tom risked it.
Excuse me, can I help you?
The paragraph that the teacher asked Sarah to read was not an interesting one.
Tomi and Mari are both good teachers.
Tom gave Marin his number.
Rod lives in front of John.
The lights are very hot.
There is no money to sell it.
Tom would have walked.
Tell Tom to meet with us at the station.
A professional diver.
It's good to see you again.
Tom was a good worker.
Everyone has the right to be a fool, and some people abuse that right.
I just need a little encouragement.
Dani finds out that Linda is dead.
I'm not the person I've ever been.
I'm not Catholic.
Let's rest here.
We're running out of money.
I don't want to walk with you.
I don't understand anything.
What is the price of this hat?
I'm from Trondheim.
Tom doesn't know.
I need more places.
Tom taught me the most of what I could in French.
Do we have a drink?
He keeps his money in the bank.
I don't care if you believe me.
What do you think these are?
It's hard to do everyone's favor.
There's a solution.
How much do you think Tom's making?
Well, there's no such thing.
This world is controlled by evil forces.
He laughed to shake his fear.
I'm in line.
Can I have a pound of thin tuna, please?
Don't freak out.
The story was real.
The wounded cried out of pain after the depressive effect had passed.
That's what I need.
How much money do you have?
Concentrate!
They don't talk at all.
Stop the fire!
He always asks for your opinions.
We use margarine instead of butter.
I am very pleased with this purchase.
When two people do the same thing, it's not the same.
I'm not the one Tom has a problem with.
How much will Tom get?
Is it true that Tom committed suicide?
Serbia borders Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, Bosnia and Montenegro.
You can follow his advice, too.
My name is Ricardo, and yours?
She speaks in Maria's dream.
I don't expect this to ever happen again.
That's yours, Tom!
Get me another beer.
My shoe scissors got into the moving staircase.
What's the taste of ice cream?
Thomas speaks French.
I'm sleeping.
He doesn't understand you.
I'll explain.
Tom retired a few years ago.
We're all safe.
It was a success.
Calm down!
There were two bottles of wine.
Come in tomorrow!
Can we try this one?
The table is green.
Tom should have won the race.
I need it to be written down.
I'm not there yet to give up.
I don't want to know either.
Fate often gives us what we don’t expect.
What's the recipe?
We're competitors.
Give me a painkiller, please.
You're totally wrong.
He was very cold, so he didn't come to school today.
There's something wrong.
They'll be negotiating tomorrow.
The surface of this table is smooth.
Open it!
Do you speak English?
He got up early to see the sunrise.
Tom took part in a webinar.
Do I feel sarcasm?
It's hard to steal a thief.
Tom can never get out of the soda.
Tell me, where's the police?
He was so tired, he fell asleep right away.
I hope that in the near future I will begin to learn your beautiful language.
Tom was so paranoid.
I need tools.
I'll count to three.
Don't talk.
Tomi didn't even know how to say thank you in French.
Where is the nearest pharmacy?
Sing it.
Tom and Mari are as different as fire and water.
Tomi is a good rapporteur.
We have less than three hours.
Tom's parents were hippies.
That's not a mistake.
This car looks like my own.
You're so stupid.
It may be clear to you, but not to me.
Don't try to impersonate.
No one can know everything.
He's a bus driver.
Don't eat!
But that's not the real problem.
What's the title of the book?
Tom loved me.
Are you telling us the truth?
Russia is great.
Who's the woman standing there?
Tom was bankrupt.
Tom was the most influential man in town.
I can't wait to get married.
Is it cold in Germany?
Leave my camera alone.
You gotta go crazy.
Don't ask me to help you any more.
I'm not coming.
Thank you. Thank you.
Let's get a pine tree.
It's not drinking water.
Did you know them personally?
Tom doesn't look too happy, does he?
Please, say it louder.
You have to keep your eyes open.
Tomina has a black cat.
Courage gives birth to heroes and trust in friendships.
Again, it came out with the old story.
Tom bought Mary a box of chocolate.
My fate is in your hands.
Let's talk about something else.
The light went out and we stayed there in the dark.
I'm planning to clean up my room.
The horse stopped and was not willing to go any further.
He accused them of robbery.
I think you're the only one who needs help.
I've decided to join the volunteer firefighters.
Tom stood up, but then sat down again.
I love your dinosaur.
I'd rather not go out today.
That woman sitting there is her current wife.
I got the letter.
I feel a lot better today.
The train arrived exactly.
You can't do anything wrong by learning a language.
Shut up or I'll kick you out.
Is everything ready?
I gotta go.
I'm not yelling.
Nothing proves their existence.
Mathematicians are poets, they just have to prove what their imagination has made.
I'm a collaborator.
He was most afraid of the mess.
No one knows what will happen in the future.
Good morning, honey.
What do you think of modern art?
My name's not Tom.
The heat is cold today.
George is the busiest boy in our class.
Tom's in the tent, right?
Rome was not built in a day.
How old were you when you started studying French?
What happened to the money?
We must protect ourselves from all attempts that take away our freedom.
Seventy-five divided by fifteen.
What did you do last night?
Let's eat a steak.
Tom's intentions were not clear.
Do you have my book?
Please, think about it.
Tom did what he liked to do.
I see the light.
I'm just as guilty as anyone else.
You're worse than me.
Don't mess with me back here.
There's nothing urgent.
Tom won't hurt me.
Vegetable price.
You can't always win.
It's a silver coin.
I feel powerless.
God be with you!
I'm obese.
It's ten o'clock tonight.
The road is full of cats.
What do the newspapers say?
You were lucky.
Can I go home?
If time permits, let's go for a picnic.
I love you, but I'm not in love with you.
- Who's got these rings?
I'm sure I'm going to win this tennis match.
They went to Boston.
One of us is wrong.
I was surprised by what I found out.
Elephants have two ears.
We're boys.
I'll meet him tomorrow.
Can you make me a copy of this?
I need to give you a message.
He said he couldn't.
It's worse than we thought.
You know my secret.
He's hiding his tattoos.
I swear to God, I'll compensate you for that.
He told the boys to follow.
They have 12 children.
My hobby is to read novels.
You'll get used to it quickly.
I don't know why Tommy went to the hospital.
Prices have fallen.
I don't care if you have to wait.
We helped each other.
That was when he was out.
Tom painted the door green.
Just start working on it.
I must be hallucinating.
Tom cleaned Mary's car.
Let's take a look.
You're the most important thing in my life.
However, the proposed changes contradicted each other.
I've planted this tree.
Tom was released.
Can I get your full name?
Uncsi!
I'm sorry to hear what he says.
I told you it wouldn't be good.
Tom gave Mary some chocolate.
Don't complain, don't explain.
Here's your boarding pass.
I saw one.
What's your profession?
Tom Mary's boss.
There's little or no chance they'll find the real plotters.
They left Tom in the gutter.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Tomi disagreed with Mari.
I want to smile at your lips.
Is that a bird?
I met Tom and Mary.
Is that a wolf?
There's a military base nearby.
You have to do this.
I'm having a bad day.
All right, guys, let's go.
Tom went on a trip with his friends.
I heard that Tomi and Mari are getting married in October.
The white ball is as heavy as the red.
I need you here.
Can you go there by car?
I don't think this chair is comfortable.
Tomi poured hot water on his tea.
Tom was trying to cut down on his expenses.
Tomi asked the dog to sit down.
Tomi never comes back, right?
You know that.
It's not appropriate to talk with your mouth full.
Maybe Tominak's gonna need it.
To me, he's like a king.
She looks young.
I'm from Japan.
I saw Dana.
Tom is good for animals.
I'm not registered.
The salt you put in the soup is white, not pink.
I'll always take care of you.
Tom began to clean up.
I go to work every day by train.
You look nervous.
We have to stop him now.
Do you really believe in magic?
I don't know exactly where I was born.
I'm afraid of Tom.
I'm glad we're in agreement.
Then the bear ran to the talisman, dropped the bear's skin and touched it with the magic stick that the witch gave it to him. In a moment, the skin turned into a beautiful, moon-light-woven ballerina, and the talisman turned into a shawl and turned into a shawl.
Don't blame me.
You don't get it right now?
He spends his time on books.
He's tall?
I'll wait for Tomira.
I heard you weren't going home either.
I'm dying to suffocate your complaints.
Young people today are smart.
Police found a body in an unmanned car near the park.
I'm sure he can do it.
The sun is at the center of our solar system.
Persecutors?
Thomas worked all his life.
We walked sixteen miles that day.
Tom can't make him take a babysitter.
Shoot!
Yesterday I cut my hair.
I can finally lie down.
Cathy quit flowering.
The number of traffic accidents is increasing year by year.
You're gonna start living.
It's like you don't want this to come together for me.
The man committed a murder.
A lot of people will die.
The next train arrives at section 2 and continues to Shibuya at 4:35.
You did it?
What are they doing there?
Would you like a cup of tea?
Anything else?
I can't find my other gloves.
Tom's inclined.
Nurses take care of the patient day and night.
People today don’t think it’s strange if a man grows his hair for a long time.
A boy stabbed my wallet when he landed next to me on his bike.
Who do you trust?
Here's my e-mail address.
Can you help me get a cab?
It was an alibi for Tominak.
I know if he's an enemy or not.
Can I do something for you?
You know the whole city.
Somebody's beating me in.
Mary's not so cute.
There were a couple of ink wraps on that bookcase.
He wanted to go.
There is a lack of flexibility in Tom.
I'm going to Australia next year.
Are you Japanese?
He was a poor musician.
Animals are our friends.
I don't like surprises like that.
He was a cruel man.
It's a possibility.
This is Tom's house.
I know you can help us.
I saw it with my own eyes and heard it with my own ears.
Could you excuse us for a second, please?
What's your shoe?
I'm not allowing them to use my Husqvarna chainsaw.
Everything was smuggled up to the ceiling in the bathroom.
I'll read the description to get in.
The surrounding area was full of silence.
They're skiing.
Tom has no idea of the reality.
Hey, listen to me.
Do you live with your parents?
I'm not so naive.
I opened the door with him.
I know you don't like funerals.
Do you have enough time?
In the past, Spanish was the official language of the Philippines.
Emily's home.
My son is looking for more than me.
We've become bronze bags.
I'm old-fashioned.
Tom felt very guilty about what had happened to him.
You went out to eat, didn't you?
I'd like a coke.
Beard.
In every garden of my city, it is forbidden to bloom on flower beds.
Obviously, his colleagues were jealous of his fortune.
There's no rose without a beard.
They're gonna dance.
Learn to dance.
I don't understand the music.
Look at that.

It’s very annoying for most people to have to speak in public.
Go! Go!
When did you work in Boston?
No one knew who did this.
What are you talking about?
How old are you?
We're going to the classroom.
Tom's caring.
There are people who are easily influenced.

I caught Tom on his elbow.
I don't know where Tom's umbrella is.
That's the last straw.

I live in New York.
We're running out of coffee.
Let's suck.
What would you do if your child was like that?
My kids don't lie to me.

This never ends.
They're both laughing.

We'd better go, Tom.
It's likely you'd all get a little sleep.

It's just a matter of time for Tom to get in trouble again.
I got on the plane.
Are you home?
