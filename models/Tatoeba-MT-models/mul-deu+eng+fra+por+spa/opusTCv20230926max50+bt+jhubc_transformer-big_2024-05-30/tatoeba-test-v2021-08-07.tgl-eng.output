Your prediction is far away.
Your zipper is open.
Your letter is just like me.
You need a painting of your house.
Your name is on the list.
Your parents didn't come, did they?
Your parents should know that.
Your problem is just like me.
Your success is the result of your frustration.
You say "ditto", but it's not the same as "I love you".
You must always do the right thing.
You're asking for forgiveness.
Do it right away.
Stop smoking tobacco.
You have to arrive early.
You need to know how to cook chicken.
You don't have to go to school.
You don't have to rely on other people's help.
You should go to sleep.

What you're saying, my friend.
You're going to start.
You have time to think about it.
When you talk, you think you know everything.
Try it.
You're both really nice.
Your hair is long, isn't it?

You've done the right thing.
You leave your ID at home, so you can't get in.
You've ruined your coffee.
You're hiding.
