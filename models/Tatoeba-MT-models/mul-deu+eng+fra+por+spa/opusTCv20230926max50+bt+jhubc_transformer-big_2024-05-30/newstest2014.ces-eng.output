A black box in your car?
While U.S. road designers are striving to find money for repairs to disintegrating highway networks, many are beginning to see a solution in a small black box that easily fits into your car’s device board.
The devices that track every mile a driver travels and that transmit this information to the authorities are at the heart of Washington’s controversial efforts and state planning authorities to renew the outdated U.S. main road financing system.
Typically, the tedious design of motorways suddenly sparked intense debate and the formation of various associations.
The Libertarians met with groups of ecologists and lobbied for the government to use these small cabinets to record miles and perhaps even where you’re going – and then use this information to compile a tax measure.
The tea party is frightened.
The U.S. Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and has mentioned a number of privacy issues.
And while Congress cannot agree on whether to continue, some states are not expecting anything.
They explore how they can move over the next decade to the system in which the driver pays for the kilometer of the road he goes through.
Thousands of motorists have already taken black boxes, some of which have GPS tracking, for testing.
This is a real necessity for our nation.
“It’s not a matter of choice,” Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California State Administration Association, said in a statement, which plans to start tracking the miles taken by each California driver in 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
This technology is used for this.
The incentive is the fact that the Road Trust fund financed by taxes that Americans pay at gas stations is at the bottom.
Americans don’t buy as much gas as they used to.
Cars run a lot more kilometres per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in the past 20 years.
Due to the current high price of gasoline, politicians are afraid to raise the tax by only one cent.
“The gasoline tax is simply not sustainable,” said Lee Munnich, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently placed tracking devices up to 500 cars to test this pay-per-kilometre system.
“In the long run, this seems to be the most logical alternative,” he said.
Experts call it a user fee based on the number of kilometres captured.
It is no surprise that this idea is liked by urban liberals, as taxes can be used to change driver behavior patterns, which, for example, can help reduce traffic jams and greenhouse gases.
California designers look at this system when planning strategies that are designed to meet the goals set out in the ambitious global warming laws.
But Republican Bill Shuster, chairman of the Transportation Committee, said he saw it as the most functional long-term alternative.
Free market representatives from the Reason Foundation are also inclined to think that drivers will pay for the missed mileage.
“It’s not a tax that disappears in a black hole,” said Adrian Moore, vice president of strategy at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The initiative is also supported by two former U.S. Ministers of Transportation, who in 2011 challenged Congress to move towards payments per kilometre.
Last year, the U.S. Senate approved a <0x24>90 million pilot project, which was supposed to include around 10,000 cars.
However, the leadership of the House of Representatives rejected the proposal and did so because of the concerns of rural legislators representing the constituents of the population, whose daily life often means insulting many kilometers of work outside the city.
However, several states and cities are moving forward on their own.
Oregon, which included 5,000 drivers in the country’s largest experiment, is the most inspiring.
These drivers will soon start paying the state a tax on stolen kilometres, instead of a tax on gasoline.
Nevada has completed the pilot project.
New York is exploring the project.
Illinois is trying to do this to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 state ministries of transport, along with coastal states in the east (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida) is studying how they can implement this change.
However, this concept does not have only supporters.
In Nevada, where the facility was recently equipped with about 50 volunteer cars, drivers were concerned that the government was able to monitor each of their movements.
“Concerns about Big Brother monitoring and similar issues were a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, head of management strategy and operations at the Nevada Ministry of Transport.
It wasn't something people wanted.
As the pilot project continued, the American Union of Civil Liberties in Nevada warned on its website: “It would be very easy to turn these devices into full-fledged monitoring devices.”
There is no need to build a huge heavy-duty technological infrastructure, which will inevitably expand to record the day-to-day departures and arrivals of individuals.
Nevada is one of the few states that are trying to find available technology that would allow the state to track how many miles the car will travel, but not exactly when and where.
If you can, Khan said, the public will be quieter.
He brought some state-owned agencies to a small company in California called True Mileage (true distance).
This company was initially not involved in the action to assist the government in taxing drivers.
She wanted to break through in the emerging market with legal liability insurance, where drivers would pay based on how much they go.
But this device, which he is testing, attracts the attention of road network designers, as it does not use GPS and delivers only a limited amount of information that is regularly recorded using a modem.
“People will be more willing to go if you don’t follow their speed and location,” said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
In some of these pilot programs, a number of major errors have occurred.
There are a lot cheaper and less inexpensive ways to do this.
In Oregon, designers experiment with giving drivers a choice.
They can choose devices with GPS or without GPS.
Or they do not have to take any facilities and instead decide to pay a flat fee based on the average number of kilometres captured by all the inhabitants of the state.
In other places, they hope that the cautious public will approach this concept if the device will be able to do more, not less.
In New York City, transport officials are trying to develop a tax facility that would be equipped so that parking hours can be paid in addition, to provide insurance based on the mileage taken, and to collect information about the speed of other drivers, so that they can get rid of the motorcycle.
“Motors will be willing to participate in this because of the value of the benefits offered to them,” the city projection document says.
However, some transport designers would like to know if all the discussions about paying for a kilometre are not just a big representational problem.
Officials from the San Francisco Bay Metropolitan Transportation Committee say Congress could solve the problem with the bankrupt Road Trust Fund very simply by raising the gasoline tax.
A one-time or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid or other vehicles that do not need a lot of fuel, so they will pay a fair share.
“There is no need for a radical operation if you are rich enough to take aspirin,” said Randy Rentschler, director of the Legislative and Public Affairs Committee.
If we do, hundreds of millions of drivers will be worried about their privacy and a lot more.
Sobotka is negotiating for <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
Social democracy is raging, people and grandparents talk together and are preparing a common approach.
If social democrats get upset within a few weeks, they will sit at the negotiating table with perfectly played partners who will put on the table a ready list of demands including ministerial posts.
The representatives of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD will either swallow acidic coalition grapes, or call for a ruthless minority government.
Bohuslav Sobotka, after four days carrying a wave of sympathy, first encountered.
Yesterday, he failed to control the political gremium and, above all, to persuade convicted liars to resign.
Only him and the other members of the team will be admitted to the party until after the key meeting of the Central Executive Committee (CSC).
I apologized to the members of the Gremium and now to the citizens.
He does not lie, either in his personal life or in public.
"It was a mistake," Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek said after the meeting of the lowest social-democracy leader.
He added that he was not in the position of first vice president.
"I will announce my decision on November 10 at <0xC3><0x9A>VVV," Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
Similarly, <0xC4><0x8C>SSD Vice-President Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k <0xC5><0xA0>kromach and the head of the parliamentary club Jerony Tejc spoke.
However, he said he was elected just two days ago.
The two MPs then declared that they would do everything to make the 50-member club of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD sound with one vote.
The absurd theater was crowned by Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek with a sentence: "I have been a member of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD for fifteen years, I have always been loyal to its brand and I have respected the decision of the party authorities."
Or another lie in the live stream.
Or did he forget, in his call for Sobotk’s resignation and expulsion from the negotiating team, that the August UVV was 57 percent convinced that Bohuslav Sobotka was the party’s candidate for prime minister?
However, the head of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, by summoning the <0xC3><0x9A>VVV, did not produce a powerful army of enemies until the next Sunday.
Its opponents have ten days to flood the e-mails of 192 members of this body and the media with a cover of the most diverse drab and fam, possibly recalling the real mistakes of Sobotk’s political career.
He will wash dirty clothes heavily, there will be signs of dark alliances between the Baron Zdenek Bakal and the Sobotk Wing.
The friendly relationship between Bohuslav Sobotka and the influential lawyer Radk Pokromnoy will be discussed.
Controversies are sparking in the South Moravian or Moravian SSD organization.
The words of the mayor of Oslo and Sobotk's ally Peter Kajnar are wary: "I have signed charter 77 so that the country is not ruled by idiots."
If <0xC3><0x9A>VVV were to go down this weekend, liars would probably be forced to ritually sacrifice their duties.
The traitors sweep their heads with ash and stay.
And the current winner of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD will then end with the nickname Bohuslav Pyrrha.
Martin Doctor on OH problems in Sochi: Communication with Russia is challenging
The corners of his mouth will indicate a negligible smile and then only deep breaths: "It's tough."
Cooperation with the organizational team of the 2014 Olympics in Sochi is a bit more complicated, according to Martin Doktor.
We can forget what happened at the last Olympics.
"Nothing works the same way," says the head of the Czech Olympic mission.
What exactly is going on?
A lot of things work slower and not so accurately.
It's so confusing.
In terms of invoices, they are relatively fast, in terms of providing information about the essentials as much as they are no longer.
For example, for three months, we have been asking them to provide us with the official label of each village, so that we can do a whole range of things accordingly.
We're still waiting, and they're still saying they're communicating.
They're still communicating a lot of things.
Is there at least an Olympic Village?
But it is no longer a disastrous state.
A month ago, we were walking through empty rooms.
Fortunately, the houses are standing.
What does it mean to be empty?
Do you need finished flooring?
Just basic concrete, so that was the state a month ago.
But they still have time.
Although there is a danger that we will be there on January 26 as a forward, the glue will still feel there.
And if they didn't, what would happen?
Do you think President Putin is going to put an army there?
That's how I think it's gonna work.
Just so it's not that Olympic village <0x3D> Potemkin's village.
Rather, they threaten not to reach, for example, the adjustment of the roads, they do not complete the details.
Maybe they'll have the roads in such a state that we'll have to bring the hollows from the London games with us.
But I think they're going to put it in the bucket somehow.
How many Czech athletes could go to Sochi?
There are now about 78 of them, although the number changes depending on the nomination criteria.
Maybe the skaters are going to go in the trio they came out of.
No one has to doubt the speed wrestler Martin<0xC4><0x9B> Sáblíková either, but otherwise it is in development.
Are you still on your way to Sochi?
No, if nothing happens, I should fly there until January 26.
We know what the houses in the Olympic Village will look like.
We even measured some things ourselves with a meter so that we didn’t believe only drawings.
We also prepare a number of other things, including transportation.
And what does the head of the mission do a hundred days before the Olympics?
I am preparing for the annual evaluation of individual Olympic sports plus I am making a regular agenda in terms of communication with the organizational committee in So<0xC4><0x8D>a.
Putin promised an ecological Olympics, his plan hits giant secret debris
Fans of winter sports are already cutting a meter to start the Olympic Games in Sochi, others are looking at their preparation with ever-increasing concerns.
The Russian Olympics, which will only begin in February, will face another scandal.
The Russians are not able to fulfill the promise that the preparation and conduct of the games will not disturb the nature of the Krasnodar region at the foot of the Caucasus, where in four months thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors will be targeted.
By the way, after the Olympics in Vancouver, the Russians had a very high pitch, and the Canadian games were recorded as the most environmentally friendly in the history of the Olympics.
However, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s commitment to organise games with “zero waste” seems to have long been his.
Reporters from AP last week discovered a massive construction material depot in the village of Ach<0xC5><0xA1>tyr near So<0xC4><0x8D>i.
So the landfill filled with building materials, tyres, canisters and insulation foams were found already in August by ecologists, which they immediately reported.
The Russian authorities have removed the boilers and the debris.
But just for a moment.
Last week, reporters were given a look at the landfill of the size of three football pitches.
It’s not the only one, there have been several in the area, described the British newspaper The Times.
The Russian Railways, a state monopoly, are working on the site, which is building a roughly 60-kilometer road between Sochi Airport and the sports resort.
The company, which had already shed 280 billion rubles, was led by one of Putin’s close associates, Vladimir Jakunin.
In August, the railways were prevented from setting up a depot by one of the subcontractors.
The locals are already desperate.
According to the population of Achstyr, trucks full of waste have been running around for three months, both day and night.
According to experts, the waste threatens to contaminate the local Mzymtu river, other streams and finally the Black Sea.
"Water from here is contaminating volcanic springs over the next ten to fifteen years," said Vladimir Kimaev, an ecological non-profit organization of the EWNC, to the British newspaper.
Illegal deposits are not the only problem of the Russian organizational committee and the government.
The most expensive Olympics in history, according to the opposition, are one large tunnel.
For comparison, games in Sochi will cost <0x24>51 billion, while the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing amounted to <0x24>43 billion.
Last year’s games in London cost only 19 billion and the mentioned Vancouver nine billion.
In addition to corruption scandals, project delays and fears that there will be enough snow in the end, there have also been reports that human rights are not being respected when working on the exhibition venues and infrastructure.
Last month, one of the workers slipped his mouth to protest that he had not been paid for two months.
Many are also concerned about how Russian organizers are matching the new law that prohibits the promotion of homosexuality during the games.
Some visitors are preparing to support Russian gays at the Olympics.
Young couple matured to live with their parents, the new house offers privacy for both generations
Japanese studio Tai and Associates was commissioned to design a house on a plot located at the corner of two streets, with the land itself narrowing slightly.
In addition, the requirement was that there will be two generations living in the house that would want to live together, but at the same time each should have its own distinct space.
The younger couple also needed a small office.
The house stands on the corner of two streets and on a slightly sloping land.
The architects therefore decided to place each household in one of the floors of the house.
"In making the proposal, we respected the family ties, history and memories associated with the place."
"Three different functions of the house are connected by several paths through the exterior of the object, so that everyone is aware of the presence of others, but at the same time they have their privacy," the designers explain.
The family of parents is at the level of the garden with an old pine tree, to which family traditions and memories are attached.
Individual parts of the house are easily recognizable from the outside, because they differ in different final layout of the facades.
While the main segment of the building is made of concrete, the surface of which was created using panels of boards, the part where the office is, is melted white and the remaining elements remained in a clean concrete finish without further modification.
Many walls of the house are completely glazed, thanks to which the interior of the house is very attached to the exterior.
The home of the parents, more precisely the kitchen, dining room and living room, surrounds a small garden with a tree that is of great importance to the family.
Connecting the interior with the exterior emphasizes the side wall, which starts in the garden and continues to the living room.
Kitchen space in the home of a young couple.
The young couple enters the house by the main entrance to the hall and then climbs the stairs into their spaces.
The stairs are the main dominant interior of the house.
Their design allows a lot of natural light to pass through them in a cascading way.
It was in this way that the architects tried to differentiate the house from the others and print something unique to it.
The household of a young couple is treated as one open space with a kitchen area, dining room and living room together.
From the terrace it is separated only by a glass wall with sliding doors.
Living area with dining and kitchen area in the home of a young couple.
The second floor is composed as one large open space, which freely passes on the terrace, from where there is a nice view of Tokyo Bay.
The office itself on the top floor is crafted in a clean combination of white and black.
The staircase is a dominant element of the interior of the house.
The young couple enters the house by the main entrance, finds themselves in the entrance hall and then climbs up the stairs from there.
Defend academic freedoms, it applies to Zeman and ODS.
In recent months, I have repeatedly called on students, pedagogues and high school leaders in several regions to defend academic freedoms from the election campaign conducted by President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman at the schools.
I have met with more or less success.
The Rector of Masaryk University in Brno, who refused the lecture of the Honorary President of SPOZ - Zemanovci in the pre-election period, even received revenge in the form of a non-invitation to the celebration of the national holiday of the Czech Republic.
Here is a list of school representatives who were no longer so brave and allowed the visit of Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman: Higher technical education in Brno, Hladnov Gymnasium in Ostrava, Business School in Ostrava, Business Academy in Cologne, J.E. University in Purkyn na <0xC3><0x9A>.
Now we are in Pardubice with the continuation of the promotion of politics in higher education.
Simeon Karamazov, the newly elected member of the ODS, dean of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics of the University of Pardubice, refuses to step down from his academic position and it seems normal for him.
Mr. Professor, this is not really the same as if you were, for example, the mayor of a small town.
Do you want to rank among the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD hajtmans who simultaneously perform the function of MP and hajtman and as they degrade both professions?
Because you're telling people that they can handle both of these demanding functions on the left side of the back.
I know, we have the example of Michael Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ka, who even manages dozens of functions at once.
This is probably not an example of the person you should be guided by.
We will also find the opposite and positive example of MUDr. <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pánka Fran<0xC5><0x88>ková, who prefers to leave the post of MP so that she can devote herself fully to the leadership of the city of Pardubice.
The main reason for my recommendation, however, to leave the position of dean is that you violate the apolitical nature of the academic grounds of the University of Pardubice during your duties.
The management of the Pardubice ODS sees your current impact on both posts as an advantage for the University.
However, your "your" school will be able to help even without remaining a dean.
I think your students will have a similar opinion as I do and Rector Miroslav Ludwig.
So consider your resignation and keep your face.
Otherwise, it may happen to you that the voters will count for you in the next election.
And that doesn't have to be long.
In Kunovi<0xC4><0x87>'s bubbles of cabbage, chemistry doesn't add to it
More than a thousand tons of sour cabbage will be produced in the coming months in Slovak Fruta Kunovice, which belongs to the Hamé food group.
The season here began in October and lasts about half a year.
Since 1925, it has always been produced in a traditional way, i.e. by dancing in large dances.
In modern industrial times, this is a rarity.
Our employees will find a nearly ten-kilometre route for change.
Fifteen to thirty tons of cabbage will enter each of the ten tanks, one of which takes three shifts to complete," said David Kladroba, director of the Slovak Fruta plant.
Farmers from Ostro<0xC5><0xBE>sk and B<0xC5><0x99>eclavsk mainly drive their heads into the company’s premises directly from their fields.
The Fruta employees then clean the vegetables, remove the bones and throw them into the bowl.
From here, the already cut cabbage falls into pools of six metres deep, in which boots in white clothes and holins work tirelessly.
This eliminates unwanted air.
The last wet layer of the velvet is covered with sail and loaded with water.
"The green circle will then ripen for six to eight weeks for spontaneous milk fertilisation without any addition of fertilizer-promoting substances," Kladroba said.
The natural process corresponds to production in domestic conditions, individual layers of workers absorb salt and pepper.
The zely after evaporation travels to the filling line.
It is packaged in a sweetener into bags or glasses and subjected to sterilization.
Hamé delivers sour cabbage mainly to the domestic and Slovak market.
He is also interested in some other countries, such as the United Kingdom, Ireland and Canada.
Snowden is willing to "cooperate" with Germany in connection with U.S. surveillance
Edward Snowden, a U.S. intelligence officer, said he was willing to go to Berlin to hand over evidence to the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director, Keith Alexander, were unable to provide answers to questions of activity.
German MEP Hans-Christian Sträbele met Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum, and discussed with him the possibility of witnessing in Germany.
A letter from Mr. Snowden, which the MP delivered to the media on Friday in Berlin, said: "Although the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, the government continues to treat the opposition as runaway and attempts to criminalize political manifestations with harsh accusations that do not go unpunished."
To tell the truth is not a crime.
In this letter, Mr. Snowden said he believes that the support of the international community could convince the United States government to withdraw allegations of crimes against him.
The allegations made by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to German officials, we will find a way to make it possible.”
Tensions in U.S.-German relations began to rise as the NSA reportedly listened to Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone.
Thomas Oppermann, a member of parliament who heads the parliamentary panel that oversees the report, said that if there was any opportunity to hear Snowden as a witness "without putting himself in danger and completely destroying relations with the United States," it should do so.
Mr Sträbel, a member of parliament for the German Greens, posted a photo of him and Mr Snowden on his Twitter post.
She was accompanied by two German journalists on her way to Russia.
Mr. Sträbele said that according to a former NSA contract lawyer, Mr. Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left.
If Mr Snowden had witnessed in Germany, he would need assurance that he would be “safe” there, a member of parliament said.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he had faced harsh and persistent campaigns associated with persecution that forced him to leave home.
However, he said the world’s reaction to his “act of political expression” gave him courage.
Citizens across the board and senior officials, including those in the United States, have assessed the discovery of an unwarranted system of public service surveillance.
The letter includes an offer to cooperate with the German authorities, "until the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved."
We're sorry to be killed, but we're innocent, Red Khmer leaders are fighting
Nuon Chea was number two in the Red Khmer hierarchy and Khieu Samphan is the former head of state.
Under the Khmer Rouge government, which fought for a mixture of Maoism and nationalism between 1975 and 1979, more than three million Cambodians, or at least a quarter of the population at that time, lost their lives as a result of exhaustion, hunger, disease, torture and execution.
The S-21 was awarded a life sentence by the International Criminal Tribunal for Cambodia in 2010 to the infamous S-21 prison commander.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are accused of genocide and crimes against humanity including torture, slavery and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan fought each other by believing that they were acting in the best interest of the nation and did not know what the real extent of the killing was.
"It's easy to say that I should have known everything, understood everything, and therefore intervened and corrected the situation," Khieu Samphan said in court on Thursday.
Do you really think I wanted this to happen to my people?
The reality is that I didn’t have any authority,” he added.
Nuon Chea said he had never ordered the Khmer Rouge’s cadets to “treat or kill people to refuse food or commit genocide.”
But he admitted his "moral responsibility" for the dead.
“I would like to sincerely apologize to the public, to the victims, their families, to all the Cambodian people,” he said.
Fifty-five-year-old Bin Sivla, who lost 11 relatives under the Red Khmer regime, told AFP she could not accept an apology from Nuon Che.
"He lied to us."
"He just wants to be released."
"He doesn't care about the other," she said.
"If he didn't give orders, his subordinates wouldn't be killed," she added, adding that Red Khmer leaders are "worse than monsters."
Ieng Sary, the "Minister of Foreign Affairs" of the Red Khmer regime, who died in March.
His wife, Ieng Thirith, the then Minister of Social Affairs, in September 2012, the court found an incompetent trial for dementia.
The leader of the Red Khmers Pol Pot died in 1998.
Frontier Airlines to charge for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to <0x24>100 for the storage of hand luggage on board.
Frontier Airlines plans to impose a fee of up to <0x24>100 for hand luggage and <0x24>2 for coffee or soda, although in its announcement on Wednesday it said passengers would be able to keep the whole can.
The new fee for hand luggage applies to luggage in the upper storage area, so small luggage under the seat will continue to be free.
Frontier says it will charge <0x24>25 if the fee is paid in advance, and <0x24>100 if the passengers with the payment wait until they arrive at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the fee should encourage passengers to take care of the payment in advance.
“We don’t want to pay this fee,” she said.
The airline began charging the first and second baggage in 2008.
Passengers tried to avoid these fees and sneak into hand luggage hidden in the storage area as much as they could, so there was often a missing place in this space.
Fees are one of the ways passengers learn to take less things on board.
O’Malley said that the purpose of this new fee is really not to earn more money.
The fact is that the most loyal Frontier customers have made it very clear that finding a place in the upper storage area is becoming more and more difficult.
Passengers who buy tickets on the company’s website will not pay.
This means that one passenger on the front at Frontier’s gate can bring baggage for which they will pay nothing, while the other passenger on the front will pay <0x24>100 for the same baggage.
O'Malley said that the website and pick-up procedures will be adjusted to ensure that passengers learn about the fee before they arrive at the gate.
The new Frontier fee for hand luggage will not be in effect until the summer, but the date has not yet been fixed.
Travelers often complain about baggage fees and other fees, but airlines love them.
They claim that the handling of the luggage costs money, and passengers who request this service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street see an additional baggage fee as a sign that airlines are trying to pick up enough money to cover air traffic costs after years of losses.
Most of them did not pay for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines was the first to charge hand luggage three years ago and another low-cost company Allegiant Air followed its example later.
The only company that also has such fees is Hungarian Wizz Air, says air traffic adviser Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the additional fees.
In his December 2011 report, he estimated that Spirit’s hand luggage fee would be <0x24>50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently flew with Spirit and wondered what he saw at the gate when passengers faced an unusual Spirit fee for hand luggage.
“Getting on the plane was the most slippery thing I’ve ever seen in my aviation career,” he said.
I waited to see a toothache and a fight at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, “and the start took place in a hurry.”
Frontier will also apply fees for coffee, tea, soda and juice, following the Spirit model.
Frontier said that passengers who get lemonade or juice can keep the whole bottle and coffee will be added free of charge.
Water will continue to be provided free of charge.
In 2008, US Airways briefly tried to impose beverage charges, but after passenger complaints, it resigned seven months later and no other major airline similarly.
The last move of Frontier to charge hand luggage if passengers do not buy a flight directly from this airline is its last attempt to direct customers directly to its website.
Airlines pay online travel vendors, such as Orbitz, between <0x24>10 and <0x24>25 for each ticket sold.
This enabled all airlines to lead passengers to purchase directly from them, rather than to do so through internet travel agencies.
Frontier, however, went the most far in this area.
In September, she began giving customers who had purchased through an online travel agency just half a mile as part of the loyalty program.
On Wednesday, she cut the reward for the miles she flew to 25 percent of the route.
So a journey with Frontier’s 1000 miles purchased through an internet travel agency means a reward of 250 miles.
Customers are also allowed to choose their seat in advance only if they make a purchase directly through the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its hometown of Denver, but its business is starting to thin and lose money.
According to financial results reported on Wednesday by Republic Airways Holdings, sales fell by 9 percent and transport capacity declined by almost 13 percent in the first quarter.
With the sale of this airline, Republic is trying to solve the financial problems of Frontier.
The fall of the NSA website does not blame hackers, but “internal error”
The Secret National Security Agency said last Friday that its website had fallen to a few hours last week due to an internal error, not due to a hacking attack, as some claimed on the internet.
“The NSA.gov sites were not available for several hours this evening due to an internal error that occurred during regular updates,” the spy agency said in an email statement.
The problem will be resolved during this evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a DDoS (distributed denial of service) attack is not true.
Earlier this evening, online servers detected that the NSA websites were not working for at least six hours, and the sites are still unavailable to some users.
NSA spokesman ABC News said the agency’s internal sensitive networks were “not at all” threatened.
The spokesman said no classified information is at risk.
At least one group of hacking activists on the Internet claimed to be responsible for shutting down the NSA’s websites through a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to flood the target website with information until the servers are overloaded and the page falls.
This cyber tactic is relatively simple and the sense of attack is not to penetrate into the internal network of the target system.
The former NSA super-secret agency, once nicknamed No such agency, in recent months has become the center of public attention and the target of abusive criticism of the NSA’s agents and a summary of the NSA’s product.
This growing controversy surrounding the agency prompted earlier speculation that today’s accident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
Bombardier’s profit fell as a result of drops in supplies and orders
Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer Bombardier reported a 15 per cent drop in net profit due to lower orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in the train unit on Thursday.
Bombardier, headquartered in Montreal, has also not released any flight test data for its new CSeries aircraft, nor has it offered up-to-date information as to whether this aircraft will comply with an ambitious plan to launch commercial operations from next.
After the start of the test flight about a month and a half ago, the aircraft flew only three times and the question arose whether the test phase was going well.
The results did not meet the estimates, and stocks on the Toronto Stock Exchange fell by 8%.
State bank analyst Cameron Doerksen on Thursday lowered ratings from “higher profitability” to “sector performance” with expectations that the stock exchange will experience limited growth in the next quarter or two.
“While smaller aircraft deliveries were mostly expected, the profit margins in the transport sector have greatly disappointed us,” Doerksen said in the report.
As the test program continues, we believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for CSeries aircraft.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we assume that the market skepticism of this program will grow.
Bombardier expects CSeries aircraft to penetrate the lower market areas now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and the first flight took place in September after a delay of several months.
However, the number of mandatory CSeries orders reaches a modest 177, as potential buyers are awaiting the test flight results to verify the company’s claim to low consumption and cost savings.
Currently, there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.
CEO Pierre Beaudoin expected Bombardier to reach its target of 300 compulsory orders when the first aircraft was put into commercial use.
On Thursday, the executives also assured analysts and the media that the program is proceeding according to the plan.
"The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected," Beaudoin said in a conference call, noting that ground testing and software updates were scheduled during the plane's downtime.
Every manufacturer plans them differently.
We decided to take the first flight and then focus on the updates and we did.
This will take place throughout the flight program.
According to Bombardier, the second of the five test aircraft is expected to take off in the coming weeks and the rest shortly thereafter.
Analysts are still skeptical that the first customer could start operating the CSeries 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier claims that it has evaluated its plan to put the aircraft into service and will provide up-to-date information in the following months.
“This slow pace of flight tests – albeit in line with Bombardier’s internal plan – seems to reinforce our view that the launch will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
From <0x24>172 million or <0x24>9 cents per share in the previous year, Bombardier’s net profit fell to <0x24>147 million in the third quarter ended September 30, or <0x24>8 cents per share.
The adjusted returns per share remained unchanged to 9 cents.
Turnover fell marginally from <0x24>4.2 billion to <0x24>4.1 billion.
According to Thomson Reuters’s IBES system, analysts expected a return of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion.
The fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer said that compared to 57 aircraft a year earlier, it only added 45 aircraft during the quarter.
Pure orders dropped from 83 aircraft to 26.
Unfulfilled contracts in the aviation division amounted to 32.9 billion by September 30, which is not changed by December 31.
“The results in aviation were in line with our outlook, but the low order revenue and overall market condition disappointed us,” Beaudoin said.
Income in the aviation industry dropped 13% to <0x24>2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest train manufacturer, said revenue in the division had risen by almost 11 percent to <0x24>2.1 billion.
Unfulfilled transport contracts amounted to 32.6 billion as of September 30, which is marginal growth compared to December 31.
The profit margin in the transport division was affected by problems with the execution of several large contracts.
The executives said that new perspectives will be provided in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier's shares, which also announced the arrival of Google's chief financial officer Patrick Picchette, declined during trading Thursday afternoon by 8.5 percent to <0x24>4.83.
Brazil’s Embraer SA, the third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and closest competitor to Bombardier, announced a 10 percent decline in quarterly profits on Thursday.
Cocaine-dependent lawyer who warned mafia against police investigation is in jail
Basharat Ditta (42) was supposed to pass the information to the King of the Underworld Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer was worried that his drug addiction would become apparent.
The Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years in prison.
A top lawyer who informed the drug mafia of a major police investigation, fearing that his drug addiction would be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, was suspected of using cocaine to hand over sensitive information to Neil Scarbrough, the head of the underworld, about investigating his drug smuggling activities.
The lawyer, nicknamed “Bash” (the party) and who was celebrated as the criminals’ best lawyer, was arrested at his home in 2011 following Scarborough’s police surveillance, which he represented in previous drug proceedings.
The police saw Sarborough, 32, leaving three bags of cocaine at a law firm in Blackburn, Lancashire, which was just having dinner with his colleagues from the Law Society.
Based on tests that found traces of cocaine in his hair, wallet, and credit cards, the investigation showed that Ditta was a regular A-class drug user.
During the eight-month period, from January to August 2011, he tried diligently to obtain information about the arrest of two men in favor of Scarborough and his companion.
All four suspects were monitored at the time as part of a major investigation into the trafficking in heroin and cocaine in the areas of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
After the police detained heroin and cocaine worth about <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million during a series of raids, along with <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 in cash, another 32 people ended up in jail with them.
Ditta, 42, was passing on information to criminals for fear of his addiction to cocaine.
Today, Ditta, who works for Blackburn-based Forbes Solicitors Law firm, experienced a sad moment before the Liverpool Crown Court, after a three-week trial, when he was found guilty of obstructing the execution of justice in two cases.
During the previous hearing, he admitted to holding cocaine.
The lawyer’s fall occurred after Scarborough police investigation found he was in regular contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two detectives watched the suspect, recorded his arrival at Ditt's house, and watched him put the 60 percent purity drug under the lawyer's basket in a black golf glove.
Subsequently, Scarborough and Ditta, who had dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park, had a regular telephone conversation.
The lawyer returned home, where he found drugs, and nine interviews took place between the two men.
In court, it was reported that traces of A-class drugs were found in his hair, wallet and credit cards, and that Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied cocaine use, and said he spoke to a suspect dealer because he was his client, arguing that their conversation falls into "confidential communication".
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to extract several credit cards from it, but all were detained and his hair samples were taken.
During the police interrogation, he said that he operated the office both at his home address and at the workplace, and that his clients visited him at home for work.
However, the court heard that after key arrests, he contacted key players in the drug supply chain, some of whom he previously represented to tell them what the detectives knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: “Who else is more aware of the fact that he must not violate the law than a lawyer in criminal law.”
Mr. Ditta is accused of misusing his position as a legal representative and of getting in too close contact with a particular client.
The relationship we're talking about here isn't just a drug dealer, it's a drug dealer who supplies his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his interviews were undoubtedly legitimate because he was his lawyer.
But it went far beyond the normal relationship between a lawyer and a client.
The police inquiry aimed at enabling them to continue their criminal activities as much as they could.
Mr. Ditta did not bring a good reputation to his profession, on the contrary, he detested it.
He got too close to certain of his clients, especially Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be disrupted.
Ditta denied the offence and declared, "If I were a corrupt lawyer who I am not, and I wanted to pass on information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, but I would do it immediately."
Police Inspector Lee Halstead of Lancashire said, “Mr. Ditta became a criminal himself from a criminal prosecutor at the time he started getting drugs from organised criminals.”
His dependence on cocaine has made him hopelessly weakened and vulnerable to the intentions of leading organised crime groups, who were tasked with collecting valuable information about the police investigation.
Legal representatives must adhere to the highest principles of integrity and must inspire public confidence and the sense that they can rely on them.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind the cloak of his profession.
The Lancashire Serious and Organized Crime Unit has conducted an investigation against Mr. Ditt, which also convicted him of three cases of detention of cocaine and now for preventing the execution of justice, demonstrating our commitment to bring criminals to court.
This case should serve as a warning to all criminals that no one is out of the reach of the law.
We will find you and stand before our courts.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being convicted of conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine, and cannabis.
Another thirty-five people involved in trafficking were imprisoned for a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta organized an online interview about himself, in which he said that his dream job would be to legally represent clients from the Death Cell Block in America, as a guest at dinner, and as a motivation for the work mentioned inequality.
He was negotiating the government with Klaus and <0xC5><0xA0>pidla.
Now the people of Jan Kasal have sent against Grandma.
The people won 14 MEPs, only a third of the number of social democrats or representatives YES.
However, they enter into negotiations about the government with at least one advantage.
In the team, which has already begun to agree on the outlines of a possible coalition, they have Jan Kasala - a man who set the conditions for government participation in 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2006.
Neither the Social Democrats nor Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> have such a killer on their side.
This will probably be a reminder of the first negotiations in 1992, when the ODS was also a completely new party.
“The experience was minimal at the time,” Kasal estimates, as the talks will develop this year.
Kenyan Press Rejects Controversial Media Act
“It’s a frightening report and it’s worth asking what will prevent parliament from simply disrupting the independence of the judiciary tomorrow,” the paper said, deeming the bill to be unconstitutional.
“This law is strict and very repressive and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group, which also includes CapitalFM, one of the most recognized independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media tribunal would “always be pre-connected because it is an extended hand of the government” and that restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya’s position in the global economy.
"I hope the president will hear us, and we will ask him to reject this bill and return it to the MPs," he said.
According to the Star newspaper, the bill actually hands over "full control over the media" to the government, and the Standard newspaper says that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya "has sustained a hard wound" and criticises the bill as "strict".
The bill comes in the middle of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security immediately after the September attack by an Islamic gunman at the Westgate shopping mall.
The Kenyan media turned its anger when it aired a security camera recording on which soldiers sent to the scene allegedly robbed the luxury goods trade.
The police director responded by letting two journalists and the head of the media worker be called in for an interrogation, but the call was later withdrawn after pressure from the media.
According to the new bill, media companies can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to one million along with the risk of being “out of the list” or they can be denied official journalistic accreditation.
The court also has the right to confiscate the property of the offender if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “one fine is enough to eliminate most radio stations.”
It is also stated that these measures may have a liquidation impact on what is called the Kenyan "live blogosphere".
Politicians know that when the media is silent, they can do whatever they want with impunity.
“You never know what can happen,” wrote Nation reporter Mutum Mathiu, describing Kenyan media as a key source of a system of mutual control and balance in public life.
“If we leave it to the politicians, they will bring the country to bankruptcy and throw us back to hunting and collecting,” he wrote.
Legislators in Kenya have been the target of public criticism in the past.
In May, they voted for the abolition of the cuts ordered by the National Wage Agency and for the renewal of their greasy wages of around 532,000 untaxed shillings a month, which ranks among the highest in the world.
You have to deal with it, young Czechs know.
Most of them don’t even know with what interest.
More and more Czechs are giving up their money.
However, they do not reach the champions in savings in the region.
Most of the money is deposited by Raku<0xC5><0xA1>anas, who save an average of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>181 per month.
Much more than the Czechs save people in Slovakia.
This is the result of a survey of the Erste Savings Barometer group in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
It also found that the mood of the publishers is improving, and two-thirds of the respondents are planning to give their side more money.
While the Czechs are roughly in the middle of a row of stackers, in Romania and Serbia people who consume products still use very little.
For example, almost every second Serb, according to the survey, will save at home "under a pillow".
In the country this year, the number of people who save higher amounts per month has increased.
Last year, 26 per cent of the respondents put aside between CZK 2,500 and CZK 2,500 per month for the most diverse types of savings, up from 5% this year.
The average monthly share in the interannual comparison, however, fell slightly to 2078 krone.
The biggest hit among the savings products is retirement insurance.
This is preferred by 54% of Czechs, while three years ago it was the most popular way to evaluate savings for only 36% of people.
On the contrary, the likelihood of building savings is declining, and interest in investment funds has also declined significantly compared to last year.
Only 16% of respondents used it, compared to almost a quarter of the respondents last year.
The survey also found that although people consider it important to save, most of them do not know what income they are making on individual products.
Especially young people under the age of 30 do not know how much their money is charged.
On the contrary, the oldest group of people over the age of 50 has the best awareness of the profitability of their saved money, and 73 percent of people over the age of 50 know that.
In the international comparison of the group Erste Czechoslovakia, 44% of people use online banking regularly.
They are followed by the Slovaks and the Raku<0xC5><0xA1>ane with a 12 percent deviation.
The United Nations celebrates new goals to fight poverty
The United Nations is starting to work immediately on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were established 12 years ago in order to address global poverty.
Before the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began overnight in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in enforcing the “sustainable development goals” to replace the MDGs, which will expire in 2015.
They were included in the final concept of the document, which will be approved by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, during the summit.
U.N. Secretary-General Pan Ki-mun said overnight at the summit that it was time to “recognize national interests.”
“I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and take on a process to implement the general objectives of sustainable development – the SDGs,” he said.
The SDGs will build on progress achieved under the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the development programme after 2015.
I will make every effort to fulfill the mandate given to me by the Member States and to realize our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals that build on the success of the MDGs.
Security concerns in Mozambique escalate due to conflict of strong personalities
Under the patronage of Mozambique’s founding president, Samory Machely, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputa to protest peacefully at a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, executive director of the investment company.
For fear of the future of her country, she exchanged business clothes for a t-shirt adorned with the inscription “request security” in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday at the Independence Square in the capital.
After two weeks, almost daily reports of conflicts between government forces and the Renamo side, one of the worst strikes since the peace deal more than 20 years ago, were lost.
Renamo was once an unfamiliar insurgent movement, originally supported by the White government in Rhodesia and then the apartheid government in South Africa in an effort to destabilize the independent government of the country.
After a peace deal in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts are convinced that it is unlikely that an open conflict will erupt in the country again, but recent events have been shaken by foreign investors and locals.
The fast-growing economy is at stake, as the discoveries of extensive coastal oil and coal reserves in the northwest may bring in over the next few years by companies such as Brazilian Rio Tinto and Vale, Italian Eni and American Anadarko, investments of up to 50 billion dollars in value.
The ruling party Frelimo, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions that have arisen.
The Renamo Party claims that the government sparked the last conflicts by launching an attack on its members on September 17 in the province of Sofala, the party's traditional bastion.
Violent attacks by former rebels culminated when government forces attacked Renamo’s base and attempted to kill group leader Afons Dhlakam, Renamo Fernando Mazanga, spokesman for the Financial Times.
The government accuses Renamo of triggering conflicts for allegedly attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza tried to ease concerns about instability.
Mr. Guebusa told AFP on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama sees himself as a "distortioner" who wanted to use "everything that remained of his power to try to prove that he can order his own decisions to the government."
Both Frelimo and Renamo say they want to avoid war.
However, concerns grew when Mazangy’s words were quoted as saying that Renamo was withdrawing from the 1992 peace deal.
FT said it meant that the Frelimo party was no longer respecting the deal.
“Our goal is to get back to the negotiations, but seriously,” Mazanga said.
Previous talks between these parties have done little to alleviate tensions between these parties, shattered by a series of clashes this year.
It is a battle between two great personalities (Guebuza and Dhlakama), said the lecturer at the Open University and expert at Mozambique Joseph Hanlon.
None of them is a good negotiator and none of them is ready to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo party, which sought electoral changes, has already said it would boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by the exterminating movement to obtain benefits and financial gains from the government.
Renamo’s share of votes has been declining since 1992, while the newer Mozambique Democratic Movement (DHM), which was founded by a former member of Renamo, is expected to improve its position in the elections.
Mr. Mazanga says that Mr. Guebuza – whose second term ends next year – wants to destroy the democracy of this country.
“He doesn’t want a democratic system of more parties, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to let the presidential office go,” Mazanga said.
It is unclear what options the Renamo party has, but has carried out devastating terrorist attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key road between the north and the south.
Most of the riots took place in the province of Sofala, a few hundred kilometres away from the capital Maputo, but where Beira, a port on which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, rely on coal exports.
In June, Rio suspended its use of the railway for about a week, when Renamo threatened to attack the line.
Mr. Mazanga did not want to comment on the question of whether Renamo would repeat his threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that the situation in Mozambique is not good,” Mazanga said.
The instability has increased frustration from the government, says Fernando Lima, head of independent media company Mediacoop, and many people are also worried about corruption, slow development and recent flooding of kidnappings.
“People think that the responsibility for the country’s future lies solely with the government and the president, and that he should be the one who finds the solution to the problems,” he says.
Demonstrant Omar Sultuane says people just want stability.
“No one cares, neither Renamo nor Frelimo, people just want peace, they want free access to the roads,” he says.
Children should learn myths and legends as “models for a way of life,” the author says.
Stories about Thor can show that “the raw force cannot be equal to the smart hardness,” while Arthurian legends reveal how important it is to have a dream.
A large part of the myths would be “too wild, too scandalous, and in some cases too obscene for school teaching,” said Crossley-Holland, who advocates careful selection of works at an appropriate age.
“I think it’s great that myths and folk art are already part of education,” he said.
I have been upholding this plan for 20 years.
He added that “openly-teaching” authors and teachers are in the fascinating story with a “spoiler” message for children as a “switch”.
Crossley-Holland, who translated the epic of Beowulf from English and who also writes the Norwegian Penguin Book and the British National Cemetery, says, “You can have good intentions, but you do better when you keep them for yourself.”
Probably the biggest difference between an adult writer writing for adults and an adult writer writing for children is the need for some sense of hope.
It may not be that everything has to be simplified or end up happy, but there must be a natural sense of good and evil.
And this one must be subconscious; revealed through a story, not openly established.
The old truth is that it is better to show than to describe.
Brno’s constellation takes visitors to space in new digital space
At first glance, it is obvious that the hall of the great planetary has changed in the last six months.
There is a new scene, visitors can dive into new comfortable seats, and above their heads a 17-metre-diameter projection area in the shape of a dome from the American company Spitz has been added.
In the middle of the hall is its most important part, the new projector from Japan.
To make the picture perfect, there are other smaller projectors in the hall.
Another important part of the entire facility is hidden behind the walls of the hall.
"It's twenty-one computers that generate the image," said Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Du<0xC5><0xA1>ek, director of the Brno Observatory.
Computers will ensure that the image from several projectors does not overlap, but gives an overall impression.
“The size of computers is thirty to forty times higher than that of conventional personal computers,” said Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Hladík, a technician at the Observatory.
The digital camera can embody an extremely realistic and plastic model of the night sky, the human body or the bottom of the ocean.
The spectators are so excited right in the middle of the universe or the human brain.
Another similar facility is closest in Warsaw or Hamburg.
The management of the constellation plans to show the purchased shows in the hall as well as their own creation.
There have been two shows on the program since Saturday.
The first is called Astronaut and is intended for adults.
In it, people will learn about the training of astronauts, go to space, turn to centrifugal, and then see in visual examples how astronauts face the demanding conditions in space.
The second show is for children and is called The Magical Tree - Kaluoka'hina.
It tells the story of a cave whose colorful inhabitants lived a quiet life until the moment when a nearby volcano erupted.
The entire digitarium cost about 50 million kroner, which was paid mainly by the Ministry of Education.
The city of Brno and the constellation contributed less from its budget.
The projection area was ten million crowns, the projector twelve million.
"The rest of the audiovisual technology and computers have been combined," Du<0xC5><0xA1>ek explained.
The digital installation followed the reconstruction of the entire building, which the constellation underwent two years ago.
According to director Du<0xC5><0xA1>ka, between 25,000 and 30,000 visitors could come by the end of the year.
We've studied 11 PERSONAL INSERTS!
We know where they want you to work!
In November last year, the analysis captured more than 11,000 job-providing ads, of which 4,300 were published in the daily press and 6,800 (62 percent) on the internet.
The Internet is thus becoming the most important medium for the publication of job offers.
In 2005, when the survey was conducted for the first time, its share was 26%.
In the last two surveys (2007 and 2010), it stood at about 60 percent.
Advertising of job opportunities in itself, according to the analysis, largely reflects the current situation in the labour market.
An example can be a simple comparison of the number of published advertisements in the period of economic prosperity and in the period of economic crisis.
For example, in 2007, nearly 25,900 advertisements were published in the same period, less than half in 2012.
The offer of jobs on the Internet is oriented towards a narrower, in particular a more qualified group of professions.
On the other hand, the offer of jobs in the daily press covers a broader spectrum of professions, including those of workers, said the author of the analysis Pavlín <0xC5><0xA0>tastnová.
The level of representation of selected professional groups is different in both media.
On the Internet, leading positions were placed by ads from search managers and executives, business representatives, programmers and financial experts.
The position of programmers or managers of small businesses only figured on the Internet.
In the daily press, the proportion of these professional professions is considerably lower, and on the contrary, large representations belong mainly to service and labor professions.
Of course, education is one of the most frequently mentioned requirements that employers express through an ad offer.
Other areas of study included the knowledge of foreign languages, especially English.
In the daily press, the requirement for knowledge of a foreign language was stated in three percent of the ads, on the Internet in 37 percent.
In only 2% of the adverts, employers demanded an active knowledge of two foreign languages.
Claims for 'computer literacy' appeared in 40 percent of the ads (in the daily press at 11 percent, on the Internet at 57 percent).
Practice in the field was required in 54 percent of the advertisements.
The requirements for the practice are universally associated with qualified professions.
They are mainly the production managers and other managers.
Worker professions are mainly mechanics and repairers or manufacturers and processors of food products or repairers of electrical appliances, the study author Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Tillner added.
Employers also indicate the characteristics and skills of potential applicants in half of their ads.
As the most frequently requested skills, communication skills have been appearing in the advertisement in the first place for a long time.
Employers also demand flexibility, adaptability and dynamics, autonomy, accountability, organizational abilities and reliability.
Ben Greenman: 10th Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: New Yorker
It could be argued that New York City is the place where solo comedic performances were born in America: almost a hundred years ago, varied artist Frank Fray, who worked as the chairman of the ceremony at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell the people gathered about the method.
Fay's innovation has expanded over the years, most recently through the New York Comedy Festival.
Founded and directed by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the solo comedy institution Carolinas, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year – together with more than sixty performances in small clubs and large theaters.
"Most of these titles appeared in Carolinas and became successful to the point that they are too big to play at the club," Hirsch said.
We have created this festival as an opportunity to continue working with them.
This year's event includes the performances of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as "Stand Up for Heroes", an annual musical comedy-benefit performance at Madison Square Garden, where Waterby, Roswart, Stece Jonnste and others will perform.
As the festival expanded, the world of comedy expanded.
Several comedians attending this year’s festival came from non-traditional channels, such as a show in smaller radio or television companies, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll has evolved with his sitcom (joyed the spicy "League" on a fantasy-football theme on FXX) and now has his own comedy show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was a member of both "Saturday night live" and "Parks and recreation", but she was most famous for the rapidly spreading video series "Marcel the shell with shoes on".
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with clearly recognizable voices (Surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, riding, racially oriented W. Kamau Bell), are the product of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest highlights of the festival will be the interview: David Steinberg will talk to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a solo comedian, but became a successful television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a TV Land show called "Sit down comedy with David Steinberg".
The meeting takes place at the Town Hall in downtown Manhattan.
“This city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry’s entire work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that when he's here, he sometimes walks through the street between two buildings and says, "Man, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here."
The price of oil fell to <0x24>96 per barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday as concerns about high stockpiles were balanced by a report showing a strengthening of China’s energy laundering industry.
The U.S. oil indicator for December deliveries late in the morning fell in European e-commerce on the New York Stock Exchange by 14 cents to <0x24>96.24 per barrel.
On Thursday it fell by 39 cents and fell by 5.8 percent for the month of October.
The rich oil stocks have been burdening the price in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said on Wednesday that U.S. stockpiles increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
In five weeks, stocks increased by more than 25 million barrels.
However, on Friday, two reports on Chinese production prompted increased demand, which showed growth in activity.
This suggests that China’s economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth, which has risen to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after the previous two weak decades.
Oil Brent, an index for international oil also used by US refineries, fell on the International Trade Exchange in London by 26 cents to <0x24>108.58 per barrel.
That's not it, Mr. Haske.
We have a unique way to show politicians that they don’t.
It is necessary to exert such pressure that Martin Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek is deprived of all political functions and leaves the parliamentary mandate.
Any other solution will reduce the level of political culture, which is already so ugly.
Martin Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek is obsessed with the promise he made, but everyone and politicians in particular must be aware of the consequences of the promise and consider what can be promised.
Trust is the only capital that a politician has (Mr. Babi<0xC5><0xA1> also has the material one, but the question is whether he is a politician).
A self-righteous program promoted by a liar is untrustworthy.
He doesn’t apologize in politics, he retreats in politics.
Mr. Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ku, if you mean it well with this country (and your frequent statements confirm me in that, so if you just lied - here you see how complicated it is to lie), you will leave politics alone as a man.
Then people will accept your apology as the expression of a man who made a mistake and is responsible for it.
Otherwise, you will be perceived as an inflexible weakness whose words and deeds cannot be trusted.
Either you want to be proud, either a missing person or a lifelong sketch.
You may find it unfair that I address only you, but you are the leader and they are just the wrong sheep.
And you're a leader, and you've always wanted to be.
I understand that now you're trying to fold your ears for a moment, regroup your forces, settle that shame, and then attack again, but that's how partisans or stalkers behave.
You are, I repeat, in your eyes the leader, the alpha male, so behave like that.

The federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a court order requiring changes to the arrest and search program at the New York Police Department and appealed the case to the judge.
The second U.S. Federal Court of Appeal said that Shira Scheindlin’s decision would be postponed until the city’s appeal decision.
In August, the judge ruled that the city violated the Constitution by implementing its program of arrest and interrogation.
The city of its conclusions and its amending regulation thought, including a decision to assign supervision to the police department to change its procedures and its training program associated with them.
The Court of Appeal on Tuesday heard the arguments for the requested postponement.
The appellate court said that the judge must be appealed from the case because she entered into conflict with the rules of conduct for the judge, by not acting as a judge in accordance with the request to avoid the appearance of entrepreneurship, in part because of a series of interviews with the media, which she responded to and for the public.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people when they misdirected blacks and Hispanics as part of their arrest and search program.
It established an independent oversight to oversee major changes, including reforms in procedures, training and supervision, and ordered the launch of a pilot program to test the cameras carried on the body in some areas where people are most frequently stopped.
In August, New York City agreed to terminate the method of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases were denied after a police investigation.
The oral justification for the city’s appeal is scheduled for some time after 14 March 2014.
The tactics of arresting and searching people have been criticized by a number of civil rights defenders.
In some form, people have been stopped and searched for a number of decades, but recorded surveys under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg have dramatically increased to a record number of 684,330 in 2011, in most cases blacks and Hispanics.
In 2004, four men, all of whom belong to minorities, filed a lawsuit that became a case of group lawsuit.
Proponents of changes to the stopping and screening program carried out by the police department in NY claim that the changes will put an end to unfair practices, increase the credibility and effectiveness of the police force, and may affect how these practices are used by other police departments.
Opponents claim that the changes will reduce police morale, but not crime, and that it will squander money, but it will not solve the wider problem when the police force is under pressure after its numbers have decreased by several thousand in the last decade.
The judge noted that she did not end the practice of arresting and searching people who are constitutional, but reformed the way the police department’s inspections were introduced.
Fifty-five shopping malls face low visits
This is based on real estate consulting firms Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.
In Prague Bohnic, the Cracow Shopping Centre will be opened to the public and will be the 19th Prague shopping centre.
There are now a total of 90 major shopping centers in the Czech Republic.
Unsatisfactory performance affects about 20 percent of medium-sized and large centers.
The main problems are an inadequately large centre against the location and poor layout, i.e. too much flooring or complicated and opaque arrangement of passages, or dead sites of the centre," said Michal Soták of Cushman & Wakefield.
According to Jones Lang LaSalle Sylvie Samadi, head of retail real estate, about one-fifth of the shopping malls are facing low visits.
The main reasons include poor accessibility of transport, low income categories of locals or market oversaturation in a given location.
Some projects opened almost entirely, but their results were largely unsatisfactory at first.
Nowadays, customers are somewhat conservative and do not like to change their shopping habits.
The new shopping centers need to make more efforts to attract their customers to new brands in the market, entertainment, services and marketing events,” Samadi added.
The occupancy of shopping malls is generally stable, according to Soták, even in some centers it is rising, because tenants were willing in the crisis to discount from rent and hire some units.
"But it is true that some projects have recently opened, which are not fully occupied and thus reduce the average occupancy (e.g. Breda & Weinstein in Opava, <0xC5><0xA0>antovka in Olomouc)," Soták added.
According to Sylvia Samadi, the shopping malls opened in the last two years are moving very slowly on the market.
There is a place on the market for new projects.
The number of places suitable for the construction of a successful project is very limited.
For example, in Prague we see a space for the construction of a project that would serve the inhabitants of Prague 6.
There is certainly room on the market for the construction of smaller local projects, so-called 'confinence centers', focused on shopping and daily services for the population living in the immediate vicinity," Samadi said.
Also, according to Soták there is a place for further shopping centers in the domestic market.
And both for small ‘service’ centers, for large projects in Prague, or medium-sized projects, or expansion in regional cities.
"Cities like Kladno, <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice, Brno or Plze<0xC5><0x88> have room for further growth," Soták added.
In Prague, they see the space for a ready-made shopping center on Victory Square, and according to him, they have a clear potential of the street Na P<0xC5><0x99>íkopá and Wenceslas Square.
"Intensively, the expansion of retail parks is developing, allowing traders to cover and expand into increasingly smaller cities at favorable rental and operating costs, space is also still in some locations for smaller local or residential shopping malls," which have been built by the retailers, respectively.
There are currently 90 modern shopping centres in the Czech Republic with a total of more than 2.2 million square meters of gross leasable land.
A quarter of all these shopping malls are located in Prague.
Among the 20 largest shopping malls, according to the number of tenants, nine are in Prague, according to data from Incoma GfK.
In the number of shopping parks, the Czech Republic is below the EU average, compared to the values from Britain and France, the Czech Republic is about 50 square meters per thousand inhabitants.
Coulson sneaks into his phone to check his tip
Former News of the world (NotW) editor Andy Coulson allegedly used the methods of “putting in the phone, tracking and confrontation” to confirm the tricky tip on the love relationship that was supposed to be involved with then-Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
Attorney Andrew Edis at the Old Bailey Court said News of the World had captured false news in May 2005 that Clarke had been seen with his "attractive special counsel" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper commissioned private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to sneak into Pawlby's voting booth and penetrate her privacy, but the court heard that Coulson also called her and left her voice messages.
"The Attorney General suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not a man who stands in front of the house and hopes that people will catch up outside, but a man who likes to tell people stories to see what they're going to say about it," Mr. Edis said.
He said that the NotW newspapers used three ways to investigate stories: dragging into the phone, tracking, and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows about the second one, the tracking, he must know about her.
What about the first one?
Does she know about getting on the phone?
He says no, we say, "But he certainly knows."
The story of the love relationship in which Clarke is involved was first captured by the NotW Newspaper Reporting Department when a source who was sexually interested in Mrs. Pawlby was told, “You’re wasting time, that’s with Charles.”
The recording with voice messages taken from her phone on at least three occasions, was obtained at Mulcairo's house in August 2006.
Investigators also found records on a private investigator's computer where Mrs. Pawlby and her sister were labeled "Projects".
During the time Mrs. Pawlby was investigated, her grandparents received anonymous phone calls asking for information about Pawlby, Mr. Edis said.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup were monitoring the movement of Mrs. Pawlby.
Coulson left her a voice message on June 18, 2005, stating, "I got a story we're going to tell tomorrow and I'd love to talk to Charles about."
Mr. Edis says Coulson's involvement in the story was based on the same model as that of other prominent figures, including former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
In court on Thursday, it appeared that Coulson was confronting Mr. Blunkett for a loving relationship with a married woman, while he himself was seeing the fiancée Rebecca Brooks, who was then married.
Coulson and Brooks refused to merge with other persons in order to dig into phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup confessed to drowning in the phone.
The NSA’s Disclosure Increases State Social Paranoia Monitoring
One peaceful day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew over the U.S. consular office in Frankfurt, the capital of the German economy.
Under the direction of the Federal Bureau for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German domestic intelligence agency, the mission was to take photographs of the roof of the U.S. patrol, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media say the BfV hoped it would be able to identify the presence of the hearing antennas, and the action triggered an exchange of views between the US and the German foreign minister in Berlin.
US National Intelligence Director James Clapper once again insisted in September that the United States does not use its foreign intelligence capabilities to “steal the trade secrets of foreign companies for the benefit of American companies and thus strengthen their profitability from their international or competitiveness.”
But since Edward Snowden, who became an informant, has begun to reveal his valuable collection of secret surveillance by the United States, European governments and leading entrepreneurs, they no longer know if they should believe the CEO’s words.
According to reports that the U.S. National Security Agency was spying on Brazilian oil companies and gaining access to the data available to U.S. cloud providers including Google and Yahoo, the general paranoia of state surveillance has reached new dimensions.
The last drop came with a revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone may have been listened to for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be the target, then they are also the potential target for leading entrepreneurs.
Snowden has seen intensive cooperation between U.S. intelligence services and companies.
I would say that it is possible that these data are used for mutual benefit.
“Germany has to wake up,” said Oliver Grün, president of BITM, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
According to a survey published in July by the EY advisory service, German companies are convinced that when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, the U.S. presents as much risk as China.
However, there is so far no evidence in the entire documentation revealed by Mr. Snowden that the United States has passed on the trade secrets of foreign companies to their own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and Internet capabilities, and said it should try to limit its dependence on the US:
The leading entrepreneurs are skeptical about this.
There are votes from the German parliament that we should make a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
That’s not the way, says Hasso Plattner, president of German software company SAP.
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, he shouldn’t have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany goes from coal to cars and farmers.
All but the IT industry.
The scale and technicality of the U.S. espionage agencies revealed by Snowden is shocking to some companies who have so far thought China was the biggest threat from surveillance.
There is a big turnaround in cloud computing, where European officials have become more aware that data stored in the U.S. falls under the jurisdiction of the U.S. and are therefore potentially offensive.
According to a survey conducted by the business community of the Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 percent of non-American members have cancelled plans to use a U.S.-based cloud provider after unveiling the US Prism data mining program.
Jim Snabe, one of SAP’s CEOs, says, “We have this new question for customers who weren’t here a year ago – where are my data stored and can you guarantee that they will stay in this jurisdiction physically?”
Many German high-profile figures argue that the latest reports are just a confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to reveal their most precious secrets and that these data must be protected at all costs.
That economic espionage is being carried out, it is no surprise.
It's always been the case.
“It’s been a crucial topic for many years and it hasn’t changed significantly during the current discussion,” says Kurt Bock, CEO of BASF’s agrochemicals.
The Americans are spying on us at the commercial and industrial level, just as we are spying on them because it is in our national interest to defend our businesses.
Business managers generally do not want to boast too much of the countermeasures they have taken so as not to give the attacker an advantage.
In the case of large companies, it has long been remembered that taking a free USB drive at the fair or keeping an unprotected laptop in a hotel room is minimally unreasonable.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of Audi’s board of directors, says it’s been a common practice for many years to collect mobile phones before a board meeting so that they can’t be used as a hearing aid.
The German BfV advises executives to consider whether to use simple prepaid mobile phones on foreign trips due to the risk that smartphones can be mistrusted.
Prepaid mobile phones will then be discarded.
However, there is a concern that small and medium-sized enterprises will continue to be vulnerable to hacking and tracking.
In Germany, many of these companies in their specific areas are the leading representatives of the global market.
“Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrecy from unauthorized access,” BfV warns in its report.
The U.S. is warning its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post, the U.S. National Intelligence Estimate reported in February France next to Russia and Israel in the second row of perpetrators involved in hacking for economic reporters, immediately behind China.
A member of the board of the German risk-free company concluded that, when it comes to economic espionage, “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, said in one of the interviews this month: “Services know very well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
Parents of a minor boy from Georgia, who died in a strange accident, believe he was murdered
The parents of a minor boy from Georgia, whose body was found inside his high school gym, believe their son was murdered, a family lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta, Georgia, was found trapped in a flattened stool behind the tribunes of a gymnasium high school where he attended on January 11.
Sheriff investigators from Lowndes County concluded that Johnson died by accident, but the family of the seventeen-year-old refuses.
“They are clearly convinced that their son has been murdered,” Benjamin Crump, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never believed that he died as the sheriff said.
“They are convinced that it contradicts logic, physics laws, and also common sense,” Crump said.
They believe that this is to induce what really happened to protect the person responsible for the death of their son.
“As usual, they sent their son to school and he returned to them in a bag for the dead,” he said.
State Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday he was conducting a regular investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore said at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll keep an eye on the facts, no matter where they take me.
My goal is to find out the truth.
“I believe there is sufficient basis for a regular investigation,” he said.
Moore told reporters that the original potion indicated that Johnson had died as a result of a "positional suffocation".
However, the second drink, according to Moore, indicated a different cause of death.
“There are a few questions that need to be answered or confirmed,” he said.
Moore added that if, in the case of Johnson's death, he reveals enough evidence to order an investigation into a crime or civil rights violation, he will request the FBI and its execution.
A spokesman for the Sheriff's office in Lowndes County was not immediately available for any comments on Thursday.
A judge from South Georgia on Wednesday ordered authorities to make available all of the video from the surveillance cameras that the investigators viewed.
The teen’s parents hope that the video will contain a clue leading to the discovery of how their son died.
CDC Center Issues Schools Guidelines on Allergy in Children
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) issued a set of guidelines to help children with food allergies at school.
This is the first set of such directives issued by the U.S. government, because the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is increasing.
One in 20 children in the United States is allergic to food.
The CDC Center found that the incidence of food allergies in children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines provide for schools with information on how teachers and staff are aware of child food allergies and how to respond to an allergic reaction, if any.
Schools are also advised to have adrenaline available – the EpiPen automatic injector is most often used – in order to be able to respond to potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity.
The state legislature recently updated rules that allow schools to store adrenaline more easily.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms that appear in conversations with children who have an allergic reaction.
The child can say, “It’s like someone is pissing my tongue,” “I feel like I have hair on my tongue,” or “I’m sick of my tongue.”
Parents of Intersex Kids May Choose “Indeterminate Gender”
Germany became the first European nation to recognize the third gender in children born with ambiguous genital mutilation.
Newborns will no longer be classified only to either male or female gender.
The new law does not require parents to list any gender for such children, and allows them to list gender on their birth certificates as “undefined” or “unspecified”.
The aim of the law is to stop pushing parents to make a fascinating decision on their child’s surgery to determine the gender, and to fight against the discrimination of intersexuals.
One intersex person told the BBC, “I’m neither a man nor a woman.”
I'll remain a salad made by a doctor, curled up and curled up.
An estimated 2,000 children are born each year, not a boy or a girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 facts that fall into the diagnosis of sexual development disorders, covering the term for those who have atypical chromosomes, sex glands (ovals or varicose veins) or unusually developed genitals.
The intersex could have been Wallis Simpson.
Gender identification is not fully understood yet, but most experts in the United States say that if it is not possible to determine the gender, it is better to use the best available information and to determine it, rather than to wait and monitor the psychological and physical development of the child until the time of surgery.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in sex problems, said the new German law "seems like a good thing."
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma.
“Some people are in a life-threatening condition that requires surgery, but most children do not,” he said.
Determination of sex can be done without surgery, and then you can wait for the identity to develop.
Knowing how sexuality develops in a child is not too accurate.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It’s a mystery why some people are gay.
A report submitted to the European Committee in 2011 described intersex persons as different from transgender or transgender people because their status is not linked to gender, but to their biological structure, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically consists of both of them, and not just her.
These traits can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle volume, hair growth, pussy and figure, in primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
This report also provides an overview of the discrimination experienced by intersex and transsexual people in the workplace, as well as the levels of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys who don't match any gender now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed adults to identify male, female or “third gender” in official documents.
Norrie May-Welby, 52, Australia, became the world’s first recognized “sexless” person in June when she won a court appeal to be able to retain her “unspecified” gender status for the rest of her life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German passports will also have a third name, X, for intersex persons except M (male) and F (female).
In neighbouring France, according to a report on France 24, the gender issue is still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from this heavily Catholic country signed a petition to remove “gender theory” from school textbooks.
The American website Catholic online also outlined German law and wrote: “With the world being drawn to a new state, where gender is a matter of choice, but sexual activity is not, we’re breaking down two more pillars of civilization.”
A newborn mother from Maryland also told the Baby Zone that she would rather see her children be assigned sex at birth.
“Parenting itself is stressful and without further restrictions, especially if you don’t know your child’s gender,” she said on the parenting website.
Kids need stability and security.
Historically, children with both male and female genders were called hermaphrodites, according to the beautiful Greek, which had a double gender.
And about a decade ago, the medical community thought that sex was something like a board that could be erased and re-drawn.
But now many are questioning the ethical basis of the operation with the fact that sexuality is a complex matter and doctors can sometimes make the wrong decisions because they do not know how children will feel about their gender when they grow up.
“In the mid-20th century, it was called psychiatric emergency,” Drescher said.
When these children were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist, but a surgeon.
The ongoing theory of how to treat children with ambiguous sex was presented by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who held that sex is submissive.
He created a new concept of “sexual belonging” and argued that the social causes and influences of the environment – how parents raised their child – influenced the child’s genes and hormones and formed the child regardless of whether it was identified as a man or a woman.
But in one case in 1966, known as "John/John", his theory became controversial.
Parents of a boy whose penis was damaged due to a poorly performed scissor, he recommended that their child be completely castrated, removed and raised as a girl.
“The media presented this case as a successful case of transformation, but the reality was different,” Drescher said.
When the boy was 15, he was allowed to have surgery back on the boy and married a woman.
At the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors “use this model” to this day.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these operations appeared "discontent with the result".
This was also the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old Montana writer who was born with male chromosomes but ambiguous genital system.
Doctors were unsure whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that as a man he could never live a “satisfactory life.”
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce was surgically removed from the outer organs and scalp and was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask.
At the age of 18, he was sent to vaginal plastic.
But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was terrifying.
When I was born, I was sterilized and no one ever told me anything.
Bruce was born with a sexual development disorder (DSD), which prevented the body from producing enough testosterone to properly develop its genital system.
After he learned the truth, he turned back to a man, took testosterone doses, and let himself get rid of the pulp,
The surgery caused his infertility.
Today, she represents others in the organization called Interface Project and is trying to normalize the perception of those who are intersex.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, director of the legal group Advocates for informed choice based in California, fears that German law “demonstrates chess and stigmatizes”.
“Many activists fear that German law will achieve that it encourages parents to make quick decisions and choose ‘uncertain’ for the child,” she said.
We're afraid it'll call for intervention.
We think it is better to assign a male or female gender and then wait.
But we don't know how the law will end up, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law because it “allows adults to choose to be included in the third gender.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about legally valid sex,” she said.
German law is about to be assigned to it at birth.
This is a battle that a small child should not be seduced at this moment.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh breast radiographer who has a daughter with a sexual developmental disorder and helps hundreds of others in the support group, said German law "gifts powers" to both parents and children.
Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Because its androgen receptors are defective, Katie's female traits have evolved.
She has a vagina, but she has no uterus and ovaries.
Katie, 29, is now married and works as an intern in children’s psychiatry as part of her studies at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or a substitute motherhood.
“The law gives parents some room to fail to make their decision,” Baratz said.
It gives them time to take certain tests and think about them and gives them time to write “man” or “woman”.
In this regard, everything is fine – you raise your child and love him.
You have an amazing baby and you're enjoying it.
You don’t have to rush with an operation that is irreversible.
“This brings the opportunity to involve the child in decision-making and takes away the anxiety that binds parents because they are not sure they are doing the right thing,” she said.
In the end, the child decides which gender he/she identifies with more – and that’s a great thing.
It gives children the power to make their own decisions.
The drunken man pounded the whole house with gasoline: He threatened to burn it with his own family!
The tension increased, the fear increased.
The man started threatening to set the house on fire.
Therefore, all available police patrols in the area, as well as a fire brigade from Mladá Boleslav and a unit of the Voluntary Firefighters Corps, came to the site.
There was also a police negotiator who tried to excuse the man’s irrational behavior.
The man continued to threaten to set the house on fire.
So an intervention unit had to enter the house, which dismantled the man and stabbed him.
The aggressor then ended up being examined at the Malaboleslav Hospital, from where he was transferred to an anti-alcoholic arrest station.
The firefighters eventually put the gasoline polished house to bed with sorbent, which they later cleaned.
In addition, all pets were rescued from the house, in addition to people.
He didn't give the man to the police negotiator, so a command was given to him.
Obama’s campaign considers swapping Biden for Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama’s closest adviser, according to the New York Times, secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden’s 2012 nominee for Hillary Clinton.
This revelation is the most significant sensation of the impatiently anticipated 2012 campaign book by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann "Double down: Game Change 2012."
The Times received a copy of the upcoming book and announced on Thursday evening that the president's top collaborators would hold intensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011 to estimate whether getting rid of Biden would help revive the Obama campaign.
According to the national-political correspondent for the Times, Jonathan Martin, the book offers a thorough record of the efforts of senior officials inside the campaign and in the White House, namely, the former White House office chief of staff, Bill Daley's office, should be re-elected to the polling station.
The potential change was strictly kept secret within the Chicago Campaign Infrastructure and within the Oval Workshop.
Only a few of the president’s closest advisers – including Daley, former Obama campaign boss Jim Messina and former White House chief advisors David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew that the change was being considered.
The book “Double down” claims that Daley was the representative of an attempt to replace Biden, despite their close personal relationship, until they finally decided not to carry out this move, when the data showed that adding Clinton to the candidate would “not be Obama’s chances.”
In an interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration was really considering replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I've been intensively exploring a number of things, and this was one of them," Daley said.
You must not forget that at that time the president had a terrible outlook, so we were like, "Christian, what are we supposed to do?"
While Daley characterised the research as "important care," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign had spent a small amount of investment to find out if this move would pay off in the election.
“At campaigns, such money is not spent on election and qualitative research unless something is seriously considered,” Martin told AC360.
It is unclear, however, whether Obama knew that his team was considering this exchange.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his then boss knew about this potential card mixing.
While Daley said he didn’t think the president was “aware” of potential changes, the former head of the office admitted that it was “possible” that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that the book "Double down" definitely doesn't answer the question of whether the political probe reached Obama on the table.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama didn’t know about the research on Biden’s removal from the nomination.
“Perhaps,” Martin replied.
Fantastic ice cream that shines in the dark?
The British businessman made the first ice cream that glows in the dark – using honey.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this sea animal and developed a luminous dwarf.
He came up with the idea when he read his expert paper on medusas, and convinced scientists in China to chemically produce the protein that causes lighting.
This ice cream reacts with the language of consumption – it increases the pH level in the protein and subsequently causes its radiation.
Chris says ice cream shines when it reacts with the warmth of your mouth, and so the more you lie, the brighter it shines.
Charlie, the founder of Lick me I'm delicious ice cream company, says, "It's a great substance, but when it comes to production, we're at the beginning, so for <0xC2><0xA3>200 you get about 2 g of this substance."
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at a neutral pH.
So as your mouth warms up the protein, your pH level increases and the ice begins to glow.
We’ve been testing it over the last few months and it seems to be a great idea to celebrate Halloween because it causes this fantastic radiant effect.
It’s probably the most expensive ice cream I’ve ever made, because lighting a honeycomb is four times more expensive than gold.
So, every penny costs me about <0xC2><0xA3>140.
But it tastes great.
Charlie's Bristol-based experimental company is known for its unconventional tastes of beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
The next product is going to be even more ambitious.
He says, "I'd really like to make an invisible ice cream."
In essence, this is impossible because of the light fracture caused by the ice crystals that make up ice, but I'm counting on finding some way to do it.
Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of medusas, artificially produced by Chinese scientists.
Halloween 2013: According to the numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were able to eat sweets, stay up for a long time, and show the neighbors in a suit.
Today I feel like I've become a caregiver.
After two years, there was no sugar in my apartment and this year it will probably be no different.
Statistics show that I am the black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
According to the State Retail Federation (NRF) this year, the majority of Americans – in fact 158 million of them – will celebrate Halloween and spend a total of <0x24>6.9 billion on sweets, costumes and ornaments.
What I look forward to every Halloween is trends.
According to the NRF, out of the <0x24>6.9 billion spent, 1.2 billion is expected to go to costumes.
This year is the last shot of sexy inanimate objects.
Sexy is no longer just women; sexy can be foods like pizza, hamburger, and carrots.
As far as men are concerned, I expect to see a lot of zombies through the dead channel, and I bet the spacemen from Daft Punk will hit it on our Instagram channels this year.
According to Google, the most sought after costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with going according to tradition.
Last year we dressed our dogs in costumes and to my surprise, we weren’t the only ones.
In fact, according to the NRF, Americans will spend <0x24>330 million this year on pet suits.
So he'll see a lot of funny dogs.
When it comes to sweetness, we don’t waste time.
According to Nielsen, Americans will spend <0x24>1.9 billion.
That's about 300 million pounds of Hershey tablets, lysate, sweets Milk Duds and Twizzlers and a Clark bar.
This is a great news for the 41 million college students who, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, are planning to invade our neighborhood.
In fact, during Halloween, we buy, and believe it, 45 million pounds of chocolate.
The only thing we don’t want is corn candy, and yet, according to the National Candy Association, almost 16,000 tons of candy are sold around Halloween.
That's about 9 billion individual corn cans.
That's a secret that I've never disappointed.
Nothing is more typical for Halloween than scary houses.
They have the best titles, such as "Terror behind the walls", "Howl-O-Scream" and "The house of shock".
In fact, there are in the United States as many as 1,200 officially dedicated horror houses, which according to the company, American horror houses have a profit of <0x24>500 million, and that includes the amazing photos that you're staring at, and that's what your friend's giving you, and that's what you're scaring for, and you're not licking them from, and that's what you're doing.
And finally, a little bit about cigars.
When we were little, Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin, and cutting the bulb candlelight is like decorating a Christmas tree – we’ve been doing it since childhood.
Fortunately for us, the trend of “child in a barn” started with the Pinterest app only last year, so most of us grew up on the fact that we cut the stick instead of sitting in it.
This year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans will spend about <0x24>106 million on pigeons.
The chimney chandelier with a sparkling flame on your front porch probably comes from Illinois, where 245,000 tons of chimney grew this year.
If you're looking for something extra, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon from Napa, California, and try cutting off their barns weighing almost one ton.
Land Rover Racing Series Announced
The interior has racing seats and six-point safety belts as well as intercommunication equipment.
The choice includes enhanced brakes, service packages providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and vehicle storage between races.
Drew Bowler, Bowler Motorsport’s chief technical officer, said: “The race participants who come to Bowler have changed.”
Not everyone is an experienced racer, but they are people who want excitement and adventure and also an achievable road to world-class races.
We are pleased to offer them this journey in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to experience different racing disciplines in the UK and overseas, and that it will prepare competitors for the toughness and reality of the Rally Raid races.
We really enjoyed the development of the Defender Challenge – it will be a really exciting competition.
In addition, Defender Challenge will offer a training and testing day in February, as well as the opportunity to compete in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Schwarzenberg: We have an early election in two years
TOP 09 President Karel Schwarzenberg is looking forward to another early election.
A week after the latter in an interview for Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz he said that there is no other way out, and every government coming out of the vote last Friday and Saturday is an impossible blind man.
"It can't last long," said Karel Schwarzenberg, estimating the lifespan of the beginning of the election period in two years.
Opposing that voters will barely make a completely different choice next time, he disagrees: "I think it will be a bit more balanced decision."
At the same time, the president of the TOP 09 will not admit that his party could still lose voters in the next elections like this year (about 300,000 votes were lost in 2010).
Schwarzenberg estimates that if it was clear within two months that the early elections would be held, it would be reinforced by Andreje Babi<0xC5><0xA1>’s 2011 YES movement.
Otherwise, according to Schwarzenberg, Babi<0xC5><0xA1> will lose.
The turbulent situation in the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, where President Bohuslav Sobotka, after a secret lane meeting of part of the party’s leadership, declared that he or Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek would remain in the leadership of social democracy, comments Schwarzenberg after his:
"The leading officials of the democratic party as little boys go after the head of state to allow them to overthrow the party."
"I thought Mr. Hashek was smarter and smarter."
"Because I've never seen anything so unexpectedly stupid done in my life," TOP 09 said.
And heading to President Zeman (with whom he clashed in the fight for the presidency), he said: "The role of the head of state is clear: He wants to take control of that party."
The first laws have already been submitted TOP 09.
What was the biggest surprise of the election for you?
TOP 09 has already formally submitted its first bills in the House, including the Faroe Register of Treaties, which was discussed by parliamentary committees before the elections, but fell under the table with the early elections.
The president of the TOP 09 in an interview for Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz claims that such speed is given by the fact that "these laws are necessary".
At the same time, however, TOP 09 obviously wants to forward similar experiments from other sides.
For example, the leader of the ANO movement Martin Komárek accused TOP 09 in the pre-election fight of the idea of introducing a contract registry "stealing" the ANO movement's program.
TOP 09 has now taken advantage of the leap - it has simply outlined a proposal that had been tilted to the second reading of the House.
Firefighters arrive to rescue lost puppy who was trapped 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous swamp in a quarry
Ruby escaped after a small car accident.
Three days later, her prisoner in a quarry looked at the man who slapped the dog.
Firefighters roamed the rock wall to save the dog from certain death.
The puppy was liberated by fire brigades who came to liberate him after being somehow imprisoned on a dangerous swamp in a quarry 15 meters above the ground.
The nine-month-old Ruby escaped after a small car accident on Sunday afternoon, and survived three days on his own until being released from a quarry on Wednesday.
Its owners, Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, were at the Flappit stone mill in Denholm, West Yorkshire to meet Ruby again and thank the fire and rescue service from West Yorkshire.
After he escaped, when he got into a small accident, the feverishly searching for his lost dog and placing challenges on social networks.
At about 14:15 on Wednesday, a blind-eyed puppy saw Ruby trapped in a stool 15 meters above the ground.
On the spot, a technical rescue team from Cleckheaton fire station hurried down to free Ruby, using an animal transport bag to pick him up from the rock.
Andy Clayton, chief of the technical rescue team, said the dog was in a dangerous situation.
It was right in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and bottom.
At the rescue, he did not lift his eyebrows – he was completely frozen.
But now he's fine.
Then he got the cookies.
It was a very unusual exit.
The fact that someone looked at the dog is unbelievable.
Peter Lau, the chief of the technical rescue team, said: “Ruby was very fortunate during his escape.”
There was a possibility that he would be seriously injured or even worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for an examination, and besides exhaustion and dehydration, he was fine.
Miss Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, “I was scared when I looked at the rescue.”
First of all, I couldn’t believe how he got there.
It was wonderful to hold him in his arms again.
The veterinarian said that if he got too exhausted and collapsed, he would probably fall.
The firefighters did a great job.
What they did was very courageous.
We're so grateful to them, they were all just awesome.
Mr. Alderson of Keighley added, "We thought he might fall, but he stayed there."
The firefighters were great.
We still don't understand how he got there.
Mick Jagger claims that 18-year-old Katy Perry hasn’t been out since.
During an interview for an Australian radio show, the pop star said this week that she was singing accompanying vocals for Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard".
Perry said that when she was 18, she had dinner with this rock veteran and he went after her.
And she added, “It was a long time ago and now it’s very nice to me.”
In a statement Thursday, Jagger's 70-year-old spokesman said he categorically refused to ever make Katy Perry's proposals.
The representative said, “Maybe you’re confusing him with someone else.”
Perry was one of the guest singers who appeared on the Rolling Stones concert line this year.
Her new album "Prism" debuted in first place this week.
George Kerevan: Divided Europe gives Scots a choice
Next day, another frightening story about independence.
This time, there is a warning that the condition for an independent Scotland to join the EU would be its accession to Schengen.
This gave rise to the stories about passport controls in Berwick and the thread along the Hadrian Valley.
The truth is that Strathclyde newspapers have mentioned the possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but – as expected – it has not been reflected in the headlines of the newspapers.
No one has mentioned that EU Member States spend a lot of time adapting their official laws, if they are in a position to do so.
Since Scotland is not currently in Schengen, an offer of continuing non-compliance would be a cheap concession for Brussels in return for whatever they really want from the Scottish people.
So it's a pretty weak story.
And besides, he's so old that he's become an excavator, a journalistic cage, that "independence means passport control," I heard at least 40 years ago.
However, there is an interesting idea in this witty storytelling.
Why should we expect independent Scotland to listen to Europe at all?
Why exchange the London passport for the Brussels passport, especially now?
This is a true European story: the great post-war plan to unify Europe has finally come to an end.
As a result of the euro crisis, the so-called Project Europe is officially dead.
Throughout Europe, they gain the influence of a party dedicated to the opposition to the EU or the abolition of the euro as a common currency.
Even in Germany, the Euroskeptic party Alternative for Germany – founded this year – came from nowhere and already won almost five million votes in the September federal election, which essentially “expulsed” Liberal Democrats from the Bundestag.
On domestic soil, there has always been resistance to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has become a decisive moment.
The austerity dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank, together with the lockdown Kazakh in the national economy through the use of a single currency, has led many people to believe that the project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments are managing a high budget deficit – that was true only in the case of Greece.
Rather, it is the euro system that blocks its members at exchange rates favourable to German exporters – and that is what German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluation of domestic currencies, southern Europe has a disadvantage in domestic production compared to Germany.
The only way is to cut revenue and public spending – which is what Germany is calling for.
The current problems with the budget and the currency are the deeper causes of European malfunction.
As a result of the “green” energy policy supported by Brussels – the code to support French and German companies at consumer costs – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gasoline as it does in the United States.
This is a paralyzing disadvantage in the area of costs, as we have already seen in the case of Grangemouth.
Not even all the freezing of wages in the world would reverse the collapse of the European petrochemical industry with cheap barley oil from the US.
The result is a cigar revolt, especially in France, once enthusiastic supporters of the EU.
After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as a tool that would keep Germany at bay and allow Paris to stand in the world at the level of Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs and promotes its own economic policy in Europe as a proof of political legitimacy, leaving the French economy to its destiny.
The result: The right wing of Marine Le Pen, the anti-European National Front, has just won a major additional election and pushed the ruling Socialists to third place.
The front is now with 24% of the votes the most popular party in France – a timely warning to British workers that they cannot conceive that the crackdown on the right will automatically manifest itself positively on the left.
How does Le Pen deal with its newly acquired popularity among the White working class?
Next year’s European elections would like to take advantage of the creation of an anti-European bloc against the single currency across the European Parliament.
If anti-European parties do well in these elections, which is likely, such a bloc can dominate the European Parliament for the first time in its history.
At the same time, I am concerned that in the near future, the growing anti-European sentiment and attitude towards the single currency will merge and the euro will disappear.
The EU will not disappear, but rather transform itself into something more free in the sense of "Europe of (sovereign) nations", General de Gaulle has already preferred.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I expect that the United Kingdom will distance itself from this project and join the United States.
However, Washington’s increased interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left to the Atlantic cold.
Where's Scotland?
We can choose to be an area (in principle) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including the possibility of letting Berlin and Brussels know when to leave us alone.
I am assuming that Scotland would be doing well in a relaxed European arrangement, provided that it retains its own currency.
Cooperation with other similarly thinking countries would be easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should take the example of Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – surprisingly – the most successful political movement in Europe, which has won a large majority in 2011 due to the opposition stance against the cuts planned (and implemented) by the Labour Liberal Chancellor and Darling Democrat.
It would be ridiculous if Scotland now voted for independence only to take the austerity measures dictated by Berlin and Brussels.
Premature puberty: Adults before
Research has shown that African-Americans and Hispanics reach puberty earlier than their white layers.
Physical changes don’t mean puberty is approaching.
There is no evidence that there are hormones or other chemicals behind it.
Experts claim that one of the triggers of early puberty may be an obesity epidemic.
The trend of early puberty is not so obvious in boys.
Former CNN reporter Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in children’s health and family issues.
Should a mother be frightened when her daughters begin to grow breasts and hair on the shoulders at the age of 7 or 8?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics in Orlando, Florida this week, paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these physical changes are relatively common among American girls and represent a new standard.
“I spent a lot of time ensuring my parents that this is not usually a sign of rapid development toward full puberty,” Kaplowitz said.
Visible signs of development, such as breast growth, hair loss on the thighs and underarms and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
In the last 40 years, however, there has been only a small shift in the age at which the first menstruation occurs.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, compared to 12.75 years in 1970.
“When breasts begin to develop, at least two to three years before the first menstruation,” said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of the book “Early puberty in girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem.”
The most reliable test of how puberty will continue is time.
It is discussed about what activates the actual beginning of puberty, but if breast growth is accompanied by growth spurt before the age of 8, the girl is considered "prematurely mature".
In most cases, the process slows down or stops – which pediatricians can carefully monitor.
Faster growth can be a reason for an endocrinologist to perform tests to rule out serious problems such as a tumor or cyst.
There are treatments that delay early menstruation and prevent further consequences: premature aging of the bones, which can eventually lead to stopping growth and twisting in adulthood.
Recommendations regarding medication and hormonal treatment depend on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosociological aspects are also important.
With regard to the use of drugs, Kaplowitz is cautious, but acknowledges that “repressing puberty can alleviate problems with a girl’s behavior and her feelings of being different from her peers.”
Of course, there’s another big problem: Parents simply don’t want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
“They’re worried she might get pregnant or how she’ll handle hygiene,” Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls one woman whose daughter began to have menstruation at the age of 10.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she was not prepared emotionally.
She came home from school frightened and angry that she was the first of her friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
However, there is still no relevant set of evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media are at fault.
Boys – like girls – reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz argues that the most serious cause is the epidemic of obesity.
In 2001, he helped conduct a study on girls aged 6 to 9, which associates body fat with puberty timing.
Further findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-Americans and Hispanics tend to reach puberty sooner than their white counterparts.
Explanations are different.
Globally, it seems that early puberty patterns are influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Although hair loss is already occurring in boys at a young age, the trend towards the full flowering of early puberty is not as obvious as it is in girls.
Other doctors attending the conference of the American Association of Pediatricians (AAP) added further complexity to the topic.
Acne and hair loss is common even in infants and infants.
“We need to be careful about how we identify the actual onset of puberty,” said Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to get instructions from their pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
“It can mean you need to talk to your child before you think,” Kaplowitz advised.
If you stay calm, your child will likely react well.
Girls who develop earlier need assurance that even if this happens prematurely, this process is a common part of life.
Nadia Konvalinková in the economic role.
Does he have a new job?
Actress Nad<0xC4><0x9B>a Konvalinková (62) appeared behind the scenes in the economic role and it worked for her.
That a favorite Czech actress would plan to change her profession and go into business at the pub?
Nadia Konvalink appeared at the James Joyce Irish pub and turned beer there.
I did it for the first time in my life, and I got it right away.
Even my boss offered me to hire me, and I could eat beer.
But I refused, I'd rather stay with what I'm doing today, with acting," said Konvalink, who was a guest on the 20th anniversary of the Irish brewery.
"I like Irish beer and I'm going to have Irish whiskey here," the actress said.
Nadi, a longtime friend and colleague Pavel Nov<0xC3><0xBD>, also appeared at the event.
I am after death, and in the present new life I must not cool.
I’m allowed one beer or one cup a day, and I’m trying to keep it,” the actor added.
Manufacturers of aircraft with seat width bars, large orders are at stake
The airline’s leading airliners had a dispute over the width of second-class seats on long-haul flights, which this month sparked a bitter exchange of views at the Dubai air show.
The content of the dispute is the width of seats provided for long-haul flights for the economy class – not exactly the one that the airlines would normally precede, but whose allocated space is key to the efficacy claims for the last aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
Airbus has called for industry standards this week to offer at least 46 cm wide economic-class seats, but Boeing's main rival says it's up to the airlines to decide.
The dispute arose at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing in the sale of the largest version of their two-engine long-range aircraft with a potential record number of orders expected during the event from 17 to 21 November.
The way in which the rear of the aircraft is deployed – especially if there are 9 or 10 seats next to it – is the basis of economic performance claims for the design of new mini-jumbo aircraft.
Boeing says the improved 777X will transport 406 people in economical seats with a width of more than 43 cm spread by 10 in each row.
Airbus says a competitive version of its A350 will transport 350 people in 46 cm wide economic seats spread over nine.
Giant planes often attack each other on technical issues through ads in the professional media.
Airbus is now appealing directly to the public before the air show in Dubai, where the 777X is expected to take over with more than 100 orders.
Recently, he previewed what could be the start of a new advertising war when he showed a picture of three people stuck in a restaurant with the title “Would you like it?”
“Boeing promotes long-haul flights in seating smaller than regional turbojets,” said John Leahy, Airbus’ chief sales officer.
As the diet changes, people are bigger, but the seats on planes have not changed radically.
From the beginning of the 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-haul air transport, by the turn of the century, the weight of an average American between the ages of 40 and 49 increased by 10 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Health.
According to American health statistics, the average American in the 21st century is 100 cm in pass.
Airbus claims that its rival adheres to the concept of seats from the 1950s, when the average seat width of the newly-baptized aircraft was lower.
Airbus says it has carried out research that suggests that extending the seat by 2.5 cm will improve sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing has rejected Airbus’ seat size and says it is not in the power of aircraft manufacturers to decide how the airline exports fees and equipment.
The company also says that research shows that the experience in the cabin depends on more issues than just the width of the seat.
“It’s really about giving airlines flexibility and allowing them to do things they believe they have to do to make them successful,” said cabin space expert Kent Craver.
They don't want us to dictate what profits they get.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers there is essentially more space for elbows, but for suppliers it is a growing problem that can affect revenues.
Behind this dispute, the race in aircraft orders with an estimated trade in the next decades is worth at least <0x24>700 billion in catalog prices, enough to evade the weight of American and European exports.
As Reuters said in July, the distribution of seats is exactly what drives the battle between the last planes.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim that their latest designs of two-engine long-haul aircraft are 20 percent more efficient than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
The performance requirements of Boeing depend in part on the comparison of the design of the 777X with 10 seats in a row and the concept of the 777 with 9 seats in a row.
Profit in unit costs is weakened compared to the 10-seater concept.
“The reason why Boeing is doing this is to accelerate more seats and make its aircraft more competitive than our products,” said Kevin Keniston, Airbus Europe’s chief passenger comfort officer.
On the other hand, analysts say cabins with 10 seats in a row for existing 777 models are consistent with the fact that many passengers are for a denser layout that can go hand in hand with lower fees.
“A 45-cm-wide seat would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from a business standpoint, Airbus’ design is motivated by the threat of the 777,” said Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not deliver seats, but offer airlines a supplier catalog to choose from.
Travelling airliners even carry a measuring strip with them to check the competition arrangements.
While enjoying comfort, all manufacturers also offer high-density aircraft for low-cost airlines and regional travellers.
Airbus offers an A350 with 10 seats in a row, but says it hasn’t sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus has underlined the need for more cabin adjustments by offering wider seats in the streets for some of its aircraft.
Experts say that without the support of a single other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, the call for new industry standards will remain unheard of, but can deter the 777X wave of sales.
Number of people infected with HIV exceeds 1,000 in Prague
In the Czech Republic, the number of infected people increases annually.
For example, in 2002, tests confirmed the infection in 50 people, five years later there were 121, and in 2010 there were 180.
Last year, 212 people were infected and it was a record number.
"There is no doubt that the total number of newly diagnosed cases this year exceeds 200 this year," said AIDS expert Miroslav Hlavaty, who has led the Prague House of Light for patients for years.
According to him, from January to September last year, there were 165 HIV patients in the country, 176 in the same period this year.
From the beginning of the follow-up to the end of September this year, HIV tests confirmed 1,710 men and 353 women, with the most infected being in Prague.
Their number reached 1005 in September.
In Central China, there were 206 infected people.
The diagnosis was also heard by 156 people from the South Moravian region, 130 from Moravian Lesser or 116 from <0xC3><0x9A>steck<0xC3><0xBD>.
At least 19 of the infected came from the Highlands.
A total of 88 percent of patients were infected with sex.
Fourteen people have been infected with blood transfusions in the past.
However, such a case has not occurred in the Czech Republic since the beginning of the testing, i.e. in more than a quarter of a century.
Six children were also born with the HIV virus, he passed on to them from his mother.
The nonsense in Gravity is, but watching it is beautiful, experts say
A fantastic film from the space Gravitation sold out in the Czech cinema some time after its premiere.
In October, it was seen by the Union of Film Distributors by nearly 150,000 viewers and earned over 26 million kroner.
Most reviews reviewed the picture positively.
However, there are some irregularities in it.
Server Lidovky.cz asked experts from a number of astronomers and astrophysicists how they liked the film and whether they noticed any nonsense that appeared in the film.
Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Du<0xC5><0xA1>ek (Director of Star and Planetary Brno): I love science fiction films, which I consider to be modern, dream stories.
The film does not exclude Gravity, although it is seen as a "physically real" performance.
It's not, but it doesn't mean he's bad.
I enjoyed it so much.
You may notice, for example, Sandra Bullock’s hair, which does not appear in a state of weightlessness.
Hubb's space telescope and the International Space Station are moving in significantly different orbits, so they cannot be seen in one shot.
Some viewers of the film calculate the unrealistic effect and the entire behavior of the fire in the state of loadlessness.
Skafandry would not have sustained such injuries either.
Heroes in the film Gravity often get into a collision with various objects and clothes without any major problems will endure everything.
Criticism has not been spared the plot.
Such a massive tragedy on Earth’s orbit is, according to some debaters, unrealistic.
In addition, it is wondering why the doctor was sent to space to repair the technique.
People in the forums are also arguing about the "unreal" behavior of the lan.
It looks like it’s meant for bungee jumping.
Marcel Grün (Director of the Star and Planetary Society of Prague): I have seen him only on a wide canvas so far, but I can say clearly, I was charmed.
I'm glad it wasn't a documentary, but science fiction.
And in such a story, the author has the right (almost an obligation) not to adhere consistently to the reality.
"More than the irregularities you mentioned, I was touched by how the three-fold space station with the degrading levels of technology (the last Chinese) is shown."
"Chinese will still be in the late decade and will probably look better than it is in the movie."
Vladimír Karas (Director of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): In computer-generated scenes, the authors are very successfully trying not to violate the physical laws, and thus the naturally oriented viewer will appreciate that in various cosmic collisions and collisions, the spectators will be greatly appreciated.
Inequalities will certainly be found in a more detailed examination.
In addition, when reading the comments, for example, I found that in some scenes the preferred direction of the orbital circulation of various cosmic garbage appears to be reversed than it actually should be (from the west to the east).
Ji<0xC5><0x99>í <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pán (employee of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): Some things have been adapted by the creators to their needs, but no fundamental and invoking sin against the logic or the natural laws of the story I have not recorded in the film, and in comparison with the film, I have not recorded and compared it to the film.
From the moments that make no sense, it is worth mentioning the fact that Hubble's cosmic telescope orbits differently inclined orbits than the ISS.
As a result, the speed is significantly different from each other and the rescue operation could not actually take place as it was shown in the film.
Furthermore, at the time of the Kowalski (Clooney) and Stone (Bullock) division, I did not notice that the entire ISS would rot, so there is no clear origin of the force acting on Kowalski, which forces both actors to release when they no longer move against each other.
New nicotine vaccine can take away the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed a vaccine against nicotine that can remove the pleasure of smoking cigarettes.
A single dose of the vaccine has been able to protect the mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
It is necessary to carry out further tests that will take several years before human tests, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell School of Medicine in New York City says the first signs are good.
"We firmly hope that this kind of vaccination strategy can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to quit and exhausted all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their dependence on nicotine is so strong that it overcomes all current approaches," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been compiled to carry genetic information to create anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to create a fluid stream of these antibodies.
Antibodies track all nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they get into the brain, thereby preventing a smoker from getting a nicotine attack.
In the tests, the vaccinated mice, to which nicotine was added, continued their regular activities.
But mice that weren’t vaccinated “relaxed,” the researchers said, a sign that nicotine got into their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
Injections had to be given as often as possible to maintain sufficient antibodies, so they turned out to be expensive and impractical.
The cost of a new vaccine should be much lower as it converts liver cells into antibodies factories.
Professor Crystal said that if future vaccines were to be completely safe for humans, they could be given to children before they would like to try a cigarette, thus avoiding nicotine addiction.
However, it is much more likely that smokers would use it to stop it.
“They’ll know that if they start smoking again, they won’t enjoy it because of the nicotine vaccine, and that will help them get rid of this bad habit,” he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but they warn that further research is needed.
Tripod denies that it will affect both of them
The former Labour minister of New South Wales (Australia) will be investigated by the State Committee on Vigilance of Corruption.
Former New South Wales minister Joe Tripod denies that he would change coastal lease policy at the request of his political adviser Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties on government-controlled land.
The Independent Anti-Corruption Committee (ICAC) on Friday expanded its quest to see whether Mr. Obeid lobbied at several state ministers to lease him to the Circular Quay, where Obeid owned two restaurants and a cafe, restored without having to sneak out in 2005 after his expulsion.
The Committee is now investigating the claim that Mr. Tripod was aware of Mr. Obeid's hidden interests in these properties, on the basis of evidence presented Thursday by Mr. Tripod's former deputy chairman, Lynne Ashpole.
During the years of talks initiated in 2005, the government pressed for leases to go to public competitions.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer-term contract terms.
In 2009, rents for businesses in Circular Quay, which brought <0x24>2.5 million a year to both companies, were renewed without the need to participate in public competitions.
Mr Tripodi, who served as Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally a supporter of public competitions.
But he denied that the changes were made at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, as Mr. Tripod admitted, insisted on a shift in government leasing policy.
A transcript of the calls presented at the ICAC showed calls from August to September 2007 between Mr. Obeid and Tripod and Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to the harbour resort after working under Mr Obeid in the Fisheries Department.
"Was the topic of conversations during these phone calls the development of commercial leasing policy?" asked Dr. Anthony Whealy, Assistant Commissioner of the Lease, Mr Tripod.
"No," replied Mr. Tripod.
I can't remember what we were talking about, but definitely not about this.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Both.
Israel’s military aircraft attacked target in Syria, according to the official
Israeli military aircraft hit a target in the Syrian port of Laziya on Thursday night, a senior administration official told Fox News.
This responsible agent did not specifically say what the goal was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reported that the target was the SA-125 missiles of Russian production.
At least twice earlier this year, Israel carried out an air strike on missile deliveries in Syria.
A lot of things have moved, and it's different.
For example, the commentator Pe<0xC4><0x8D>inka spoke in such a way that he could agree with it, while the President of <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>ch was dismayed.
Heytman Chovanec was suspicious of me as soon as he was elected to the presidency, and he confirmed it.
President Sobotka has always been, and continues to be, a symbol of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD poverty.
The rest of the gentlemen showed their weaknesses.
Senator Dienstbier is principled and readable and unusable, and Vice-President Zaorálek was disqualified by the most talk on television.
On this basis, I do not see a better option than that the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD proposes for the prime minister to Vice-President Gajd<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xA1>kova, the only one who would not have an initial handicap and I think it would carry out a standard performance.
It's such a good solution that someone in the leadership hardly supports him.
I add that this solution is the only way to forget what was done, and continue without breaking the side.
Alena Gajd<0xC5><0xBE>o<0xC5><0xA1>ková could, without fear, form a minority government with only the blessing of President Babi<0xC5><0xA1> and without the people, but with the People’s Minister of Health Hovorka, who is actually a believing Social Democrat.
This minority government would have great stability because it would promote a proper referendum law and thereby commit itself to support the President of the Dawn of Okamura.
President Babi<0xC5><0xA1> would eventually reconcile with the progress of the tax, as he is smart and will see that without it, it is not possible.
People would not bring trouble, because the Speaker is the bearer of the best they have, and they would not be in government otherwise.
The same goes for YES, a valuable minister would also be found here, but if they reasonably do not want to enter into risky government participation, but they will provide support, too, well.
Let's give the courage to Alena Gajdo<0xC5><0xA1>ková!
Foreign workers with visa authorization may undergo a ‘authority test’
With the government’s plans to extend police action, the “eligibility” test is considered for foreign workers with visa authorisation 457.
The test, if accepted, will be applied through criteria in order to prevent program 457 from being used to fill unskilled jobs, or as a backdoor for relocating family and friends to Australia.
When a government discussion article was published today, former Labour MP Maxine McKew condemned the government’s rhetoric about foreign workers with the words that it could offend Australian neighbors.
“The voting statements ‘foreigners at the end of the front’ and ‘working first for Australians’ are a very unpleasant remnant of the time when unions demanded a protected labour market,” she told the Australian-Indian Institute.
Historically, this meant that the White workforce should be protected – and I wouldn’t be surprised if anyone in this region recorded the sound of this historical artifact.
The article discusses 12 measures previously considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was yesterday in Sri Lanka, where he is talking with officials for smuggling people, implemented five of the recommended changes and the rest remains to be considered.
If the eligibility criteria are accepted, visa applicants may be examined in detail whether ‘the nomination is eligible in a situation where the candidate is in a relationship or in a personal relationship with the owner or relevant person of the sponsoring undertaking’.
According to previous experience with companies that intended to sponsor a small number of employees but then employed hundreds of them, the number of visa holders 457 may also be required from companies.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan man seeking asylum died of a heart attack after arriving on a Christmas Island asylum ship this week.
A nine-year-old man’s frightened son traveled to Australia with him and was comforted by an adult cousin who was also on board after his father’s death on Wednesday.
The Australian authorities rushed the man to a hospital on the Christmas Islands where he died.
The UK government has announced a study aimed at increasing the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
HS2’s work suggests that high-speed services for Scotland and Northern England will begin as soon as the first phase is launched in 2026.
Minister of Transport Baroness Kramer said the project would “connect Britain together.”
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was "satisfied" with the British government's cooperation on the plan.
The first phase will consist of a new high-speed train line between London and the West Midlands.
Upon completion of Phase two, the line will lead from Manchester to Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and northern England from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6 billion.
The British government, which conducted talks with the national transport agency Transport Scotland, commissioned HS2 to find out further rail capacity and the possibility of improving travel times for northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of possible travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London corresponding to three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that better connects Britain and its cities.”
We gave SH2 green because the benefit it brings is huge.
Without it, we are facing a crisis in the capacity of our railway network.
However, it is also about connecting – HS2 will make 18 cities better connected across the UK, including Glasgow and Edinburgh.
Scottish Minister Alistair Carmichael added: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
Under the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Carmichael to "unambiguously" support Scottish inclusion in the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: “The high-speed rail has the potential to bring Scotland immense economic benefits, but it also adds to the economic weight of Scotland in the overall case of the high-speed rail across the UK.”
We are therefore excited to cooperate with the British Government to explore the possibility of bringing high-speed rail to Scotland and thus bringing benefits to everyone and complement the Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish Government is planning to do.
I look forward to reviewing the report on this study together with the UK ministers next year, and to making a joint decision on the next steps.
Inspection and analysis of anti-corruption police arrested together with Bárta
Information on the arrest of Víta Bárta began to spread on Thursday evening, when the message was brought by the server Prvnízpravy.cz.
MF DNES attacks found that the case was taken over by the General Inspectorate of Security Corps (GIBS), its people were to arrest Bart in central Prague.
It took place in front of the Four Seasons hotel.
The Inspectorate handles cases where there are police officers among the accused, but its powers also apply to civilians.
According to MF DNES, one of the anti-corruption police officers - Jan Petr<0xC5><0xBE>ílek, chief analyst and computer scientist, is also among the detainees.
He worked for the Security Intelligence Service in the past.
Anti-corruption police spokesman Jaroslav Ibehej, however, refused to comment on the information, adding that the media must address the GIBS in this regard.
Even her spokeswoman, Radka Sandorova, did not want to say anything about the case, she turned to the City State Prosecutor’s Office in Prague.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of secret facts," spokeswoman <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pánka Zenklová said.
It can also be deduced from this inconcrete reaction that the event took place, but it is in a secrecy mode that does not allow speakers to say anything concrete.
In a similar situation, Bart’s lawyer Old<0xC5><0x99>ich Chudoba is also present.
He told the media that he was representing Bart "and in this case", but since it is classified information, he cannot confirm or reverse Bart's arrest.
Some media initially speculated that Bártov's arrest may have been linked to former police president Petr Lessy.
This was promoted to office by Bart, together with former VV President Radk John, who was head of the Ministry of the Interior.
The dispute, which was disputed as a result between Prime Minister Petr Neczaem and VV, had even to be resolved by then President Václav Klaus.
I don’t know where this connection came from.
No one contacted me, I was not interrogated.
"I really don't know anything about things," said iDNES.cz Lessy.
In January 2011, Lessy became the police chief.
He was officially promoted by Radek John, the real leader of the party, but was Bart at the time.
Bart is now running for election for the morning movement, his parliamentary mandate has narrowly escaped - by 175 votes.
Tomio Okamura, the leader of the Dawn, said he had no idea what it was.
"Vit Bárta was one of the many candidates of many parties to our candidate and, as I have repeatedly said before the elections, he was not even a member of the Direct Democracy Dawn Tomia Okamura," he distanced himself from Bárta Okamura, who said before the elections that he had given Bárta the opportunity to run for office.
Vít Bárta was in court in 2012 with his former partner from VV Jaroslav <0xC5><0xA0>kárka.
Rules on the use of electronic devices in the aircraft will remain in force in Australia for the time being
Passengers of Australian airlines will still have to turn off their tablets and smartphones during takeoff and landing, regardless of changes in the U.S. in order to mitigate the regulations on these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given U.S. airlines space to change their practices so that passengers will be able to read e-books on their devices, watch videos or play games during critical flight phases if the device remains in "flying" mode.
Passengers can already do this during most of the flight, but many people are upset that they cannot access their e-books during start-up and landing.
Australian carriers are investigating this decision, which requires a great deal of work from U.S. carriers to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they do not plan to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) also said it had investigated the notification, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases are still in place in Australia.
“CASA currently does not have any specific regulations regulating the use of electronic devices on an aircraft,” he said.
This issue is covered by regulations requiring aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained at all times and that passengers are acting in accordance with the safety instructions they receive from crew members.
Virgin, which had already talked to CASA about expanding the use of its on-board wi-fi entertainment system, was inclined to change, but announced that it would be subject to the decision of the regulator.
“We would be pleased if CASA conducted an analysis of the authorization to use electronic devices, because we really think that now that we have (wireless on-board entertainment), it would improve the customer experience,” the spokesman said.
Qantas has announced that it will comply with current regulations for the time being.
“Our current policy is that electronic devices should not be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to change it in the near future,” he said.
The FAA regulations apply to U.S. airlines.
However, we are constantly interested in developments in the regulatory area, which may be useful for our passengers, and certainly we are thoroughly studying the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
In the case of U.S. air carriers, the impact of the regulations will vary from one airline to another and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from mobile phones, and also revise manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs and passenger information.
“As soon as the airline confirms the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable and lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, electronic readers and smartphones at any altitude,” the FAA said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew orders passengers to turn off during the landing of the facility.
The group also recommended that the heavier equipment during take-off and take-off be safely stored under the seats or in a storage area above the head.
With the growing poverty of the middle class, stoppers in Singapore bloom
In a shopping mall in Bendemeer, Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga stops her gold bracelet, ring and earrings so she can pay her daughter's tuition.
“I just bought a house with my husband and I put all my money on it,” says Mrs. Amirthalinga.
Although she earns <0x24>2,400 each month as an administrator and her husband also works, family monthly income is insufficient, she says.
Demand across regions in Southeast Asia – where domestic debt is rising – is in fact such that ValueMax, where a woman conducts her transaction, has become the third stop on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Stopping jewelry is not only a quick way to borrow cash – 1300 SGD in the case of Mrs Amirthalinga – but it is also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Singapore’s retailers typically apply an annual interest rate of 17 per cent, just above the 15.4 per cent rate offered by United Overseas Bank, a local bank headquartered in the same shopping center.
However, stampers have the advantage of not requiring verification of the person (payment history) or proof of income, and can provide a loan faster than banks.
And that’s why, as families feel pressured by rising cost of living and growing household and consumer debt, millions of people across the region turn to stalls.
After five years of massive growth since the global financial crisis and low-cost loans backed by monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families turn to stalls to deal with the deteriorating financial situation.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor’s cited the increasing use of credit in households mainly due to rising rents as a risk factor for Asian banks’ creditworthiness.
She said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest domestic debt in Asia in terms of gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the forefront of the 80 percent share of GDP, up from 60 percent in 2008.
Economists also feared high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which just got out of the technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed continued weak exports and a weakening of consumer demand.
“It’s important that with rising costs, people from medium to low [income scale] will try to supplement their income wherever they can,” said Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB Malaysian bank.
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have contributed to people happily stopping their personal property and taking advantage of the opportunity to exchange for the cash of their family jewelry.
Approximately 70 percent of the items stopped in 200 city flags make up gold.
People say, the price of gold looks good, we'll stop Grandma's gold necklace and get it back next month.
EasyMoney, Thailand’s largest shuttle operator, has seen a 20 percent increase in the number of customers using its shuttle in recent months.
The growth in the stagnation industry is so great that ValueMax, the branch operator at Bendemeer and 15 similar companies in Singapore, is planning to expand not only to neighboring Malaysia – where it has four branches – but also outside Asia, says CEO Chiue Leng.
The company will finance it using 60 percent of the 66 million SGD it earned on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
While some discounted creditors are under fire of criticism because of high interest rates, Ms. Yeah says the bailout offers not only lower rates than other creditors, but it also does not directly increase debt.
“Customers stop items they already own, and the monetization of personal assets does not increase household debt,” he says.
In the company, the ban on assets is increasingly being accepted as a means of securing short-term, secured financing.
Moreover, among those who use banners, there are not only people in financial distress.
Wealthy people from Singapore also use ValueMax branches when they stop gold bars or Rolex watches, so they can get up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Our customers are in every possible way.
“These include wealthy individuals who need to borrow for a short period of time because of their bold trades or investments, or small businesses who need help solving problems in their cash flow,” she says.
Sometimes they just need the money as quickly as possible.
Rescue package worth <0x24>325 million for Tasmanian healthcare
The federal government is insisting that the <0x24>325 million bailout package for Tasmania’s endangered health services contain tough conditions to ensure that the state government does not break the funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek said the Australian Union is taking "quick measures" to reverse the crisis caused by the island's aging population, increased chronic diseases and systemic disorders.
Financing for four years was decided after consultations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has come with an emergency rescue package, which we believe will solve the specific problems the state faces,” Mrs. Plibersek said today.
The <0x24>325 million package contains <0x24>31 million for surgery at the patient’s request.
A further 2,600 operations, including orthopedic operations and gray sludge operations, will help eliminate debt.
The money is also freely available to clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better postoperative care, training of health professionals, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic medical records systems in local hospitals.
“These investments respond to the ideas that the leading clinical doctors told me they would help the Tasmanian health system in the best way,” said Mrs. Plibersek.
The Minister stressed that the Tasmanian government must demand a strict reporting and accounting obligation.
The state will have to maintain the current level of funding in order to receive the money of the Australian Union, and inform monthly about where additional funding has been spent.
A three-member committee will be set up to ensure that the State provides services as efficiently as possible.
Mr Wilkie said today that <0x24>325 million will be worth nothing “until real reforms follow in order to lay a more sustainable foundation for the Tasmanian public health system.”
However, he commended the government for responding to his urgent request for help, which he first raised in talks with the Prime Minister in early May.
“I believe that the federal aid package can get state public health out of a critical condition,” Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additionally elected procedures will significantly reverse the recent cuts.
Federal opposition spokesman Peter Dutton believes today’s statement is just a “plastic.”
“The reason I’m here is that the Labour government has exempted <0x24>430 million from our healthcare system,” he told ABC TV.
You can’t have a government that will take away almost half a billion dollars, and an Australian union that’s donating 300 million dollars, and pretending it’s good news.
Mr Dutton called on Mrs Plibersek to ensure that not a single dollar from the bailout will be spent on higher bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux adapted Denise Diderot's novel, which brings an exceptional film expedition and the creation of time, but is also more boring than it should be.
It takes place in the 1960s in 18th century France and tells the tale of Suzanne, a young noblewoman who is sent to the monastery by her family.
When she rebels, she experiences extreme cruel treatment from the punishablely degraded mother presented, and for another she becomes the object of sexual passion.
The film never slips to the whimsy or senselessness, and that’s his problem.
The ceremonial impact of this story leads to the fact that even spectators will experience the likes of wearing a grey shirt.

Syria Has Destroyed Its Chemical Weapons, Supervisory Authority Says
Syria has destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition with toxic gas, the Global Monitoring Committee on Chemical Weapons said on Thursday, while fierce conflicts broke out in the north of the country, not far from one of the places where chemical weapons are presumed to be used.
On Thursday, the Syrian activist group said more than 120,000 people had been killed since the start of the civil war almost three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came the day before 1 November.
the deadline set by the Hague-based organisation to destroy or disable the operation of all chemical weapons and mixing equipment for the production of toxic gas and ammunition.
The completion of this initial phase of destruction is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable that aims to destroy all of Damascus’s chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the equipment means that Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still has to begin the destruction of existing weapons and supplies.
It is estimated that the country has about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons, including yperite and sarin nerve gas.
The announcement came at a time when on Thursday the fighting in the city of Safira, which experts speak of as the headquarters of a chemical weapons factory and warehouse, said the United Kingdom-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
A group of activists, which monitored the total number of casualties through a network of activists in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
There are 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
The government side has 29,954 members of the Assad Bashar al-Assad armed forces, 18,678 pro-government fighters and 187 armed men from Lebanon’s Hezbollah.
Among the dead are also 2,202 government scouts and approximately 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On July 25, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
This number has not been updated since then.
The conflict forced about 2 million people to leave the country.
Assad's units have been fighting in Safira against insurgents, many of whom are linked to al-Qaeda, for weeks.
The observer said Thursday that the losses were on both sides, but she did not have specific figures.
The fights have underlined the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors, who have to deal with tight deadlines in their mission, when they have to get rid of the chemical arsenal in the midst of the ongoing Syrian civil war.
In a statement from the OPCW office, which is working closely with the UN, it said that its team is now “satisfied that it has verified – and watched the destruction – of Syria’s declared essential equipment for production and mixing/filling.”
He added that "at the moment no further control activities are planned."
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first round of verification work when they visited 21 of the 23 places declared by Damascus.
The inspectors said they were unable to visit two places because of security concerns.
On Thursday, the OPCW said the two sites had been “abandoned and ... items of the chemical weapons program contained were moved to two other declared sites that had been checked.”
It was not immediately clear whether the facility in Safira was one of those places that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has agreed on a plan to completely destroy its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPCW executive committee next month.
“I swear by the courage and courage you have shown in fulfilling this most demanding mission this organization has ever had,” observer director Ahmet Uzumcu said in his comments issued by the OPCW.
Now, in its third year, Sunni Muslim rebels are fighting against each other in the civil war, and the Assad government with its security forces, which are full members of the Alawit sect, is taking Shiite Islam.
On further developments, Rami Abdul Rahman, chief of the Observatory, said on Wednesday that there was a strong explosion inside the air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Laziya.
He said the cause of the explosion was unknown.
Anger over the verdict of the founder of the bombing in Bali
Survivors and relatives of 202 people killed in the Bali bombing in 2002 responded sharply to the verdict issued against the last of the founders who had been brought to justice, saying Umar Patek was to be executed.
Patek, who spent almost 10 years on the run as one of the most sought after persons in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for building an explosive device used in the bombing.
In 15 years, he could be paroled.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder in an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, after which 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty of several other terrorism-related allegations, including a series of bombings on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecution demanded life, although it may insist that a man with the nickname "Demolition man" (the driller) receive the death penalty due to his reputation as an explosives-producing expert.
This decision revived the painful memories of June Corteen, a Perth mother who lost her 39-year-old twins Jane and Jenny in the devastating attack launched by Patek and other founders nearly ten years ago.
With tears in her eyes, she said that Patek was to be sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the others.
Mrs. Corteen told AAP, “He should be put in front of the executioner.”
Every day I have to live with no more grandchildren and my daughters.
The Sari Club was compared to the ground when a powerful load was ignited on the outside of a parked van shortly after 23:00 on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddy Bar, where a suicide bomber exploded a bag full of explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
As a result of the blast, he fell into a coma for a month, and while he was kept alive, doctors “died” three times.
Mr. Hughes said Patek should face the same fate as the other three members of the Islamic Jama'i terrorist cell responsible for the massacre – Amrozi, Muchlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed four years ago.
This guy should get the death penalty like no one else.
Keeping him alive... there's no reason to keep him alive, it's just not.
Getting 20 years for killing 202 people and wounding hundreds of others isn't that much.
Patek stood in court as the last of the Bali assassins.
The detention was avoided for almost a decade, but he was eventually attacked in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent said in his testimony that intelligence reports revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an attempt to reconnect terrorist groups from Southeast Asia with al-Qaeda.
“He did not give up voluntarily,” said Mrs. Corteen.
To this day, he did not feel sorry for how much sorrow he caused to others.
The verdict comes before the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be held later this year and will include a ceremony in Bali and Australia.
"We'll see a lot of tears this year," said Mrs. Corteen.
Patek can still appeal the verdict.
FAA: Aviation passengers can now use technological advances in aircraft (but not call from their mobile phones)
Passengers of airlines will be able to use their electronic devices “from door to door” – in addition to calling from their mobile phones – to read, play games, watch movies and listen to music on the basis of the eagerly awaited new rules issued by the Federal Administration on Thursday.
However, passengers do not expect changes to occur immediately.
How quickly the change will be introduced will vary from one airline to another, FAA administrator Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
The airline will have to state to the FAA administration how many of their aircraft comply with the new rules and that they have updated the training manuals for the crew and the warehousing guidelines to comply with the new rules.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Among the companies that have already submitted the plans are Delta and JetBlue.
“Depending on the status of such a plan, we can improve the extended use of electronic devices very quickly,” the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft’s doors are closed.
They can't turn them on until the plane reaches a height of 3 kilometers and the captain gives permission.
Passengers are expected to turn their devices off again when the plane lands to land, and they will not turn them on until the plane is on the ground.
Under the new rules, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference can allow their passengers to use their devices during take-off, landing and departure, FAA said.
Most of the new transport aircraft and other aircraft, which have been adapted to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes, are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Stewards, welcomed the changes.
“As soon as the new rules are safely introduced – and we will work closely with the transport companies – it will be a success,” Glading said in a statement.
To be honest, we are tired of looking like “watchers.”
However, surfing the internet, sending emails and texting or downloading data will continue to be banned under 3 kilometres above sea level, the agency said.
Passengers will be notified to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to flight mode.
So still no Words with friends, an online scrabble game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011, when he was, as is well known, thrown out of the plane of American Airlines because he refused to turn off his device when the plane was parked.
And heavier devices like laptops will have to continue to be stored because of fears they could hurt someone if they flew through the cabin.
Mobile phone calls will continue to be banned on board.
The rules for the use of mobile phones are not determined by the FAA, but by the U.S. Federal Telecommunications Committee.
The FAA may cancel the ban on some electronic devices during take-off and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the State Transportation Safety Committee, a national transport security expert at CBS News, said mobile phones are still considered a risk.
“Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially create interference with navigation devices, but from FCC data we also know that they can cause interference towers in the air,” Rosenker said.
The Sectoral Advisory Committee set up by the FAA to investigate the issue last month proposed that the government allow the wider use of electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure has been put on the FAA to mitigate restrictions on their use.
Critics, such as Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from Missouri, claim that there is no legitimate security reason for the ban.
Restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce, as the use of such devices is omnipresent.
Some studies suggest that up to a third of passengers forget about the obligation to turn off their devices or ignore them.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to disruptions in navigation and communication equipment when passengers began carrying FM radios, technical advances of the time.
The new airlines are much more reliant on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also constructed, and approved by the FAA administration to be resistant to electronic interference.
For several years, airlines have been offering passengers the use of Wi-Fi at travelling altitudes.
Plans adapted for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airlines should be adapted under the new rules for greater use of electronic devices, Huert said.
Current electronic devices generally emit far less intensive radio broadcasts than they did with previous generations of devices.
For example, electronic readers only issue minimal broadcasts when turning the page.
But broadcasting is stronger when devices download or send data.
Among those who are pushing to release restrictions on the use of these devices by passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, the company’s representatives loaded the transport aircraft with their Kindle electronic readers and conducted a test flight, but no problem was detected.
The members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed opinions as to whether these facilities present any risks.
Douglas Kidd of the National Airline Passengers Association said he was convinced that disruptions from these facilities are real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the Committee stated that there are only exhaustive reports from pilots to support the fact that such devices can cause disruptions to aviation systems, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that FAA pilots be allowed to order passengers to shut down the facility during flight under low visibility devices.
The Travel Industry Group welcomes these changes and considers it a reasonable procedure for the passenger public, which uses technology to a large extent.
“We are pleased that the FAA has recognized that a pleasant travel experience is not in conflict with security,” said Roger Dow, Executive Director of the American Travel Association.
The bird was transported by air from a drilling platform in the North Sea and released back into nature.
The bird was transported to the coast after being found exhausted on an oil platform in the Black Sea, and released back into the wild.
A cruiser was transported by helicopter to Aberdeen last month after it was previously treated by the Scottish company SPCA in a rescue centre until it recovered.
Operations Center Colin Seddon said, “This squirrel probably migrated from northern Europe when a strong wind caught it over the North Sea.”
He seems to have lost his strength and found refuge on the oil platform.
Mr. Seddon added: “He was unable to take off again, so we were contacted for help.”
When he was released, he was in good condition and in good health.
Is the European elite ready to trade with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise to merge businesses and define what changes in relations with the EU want British entrepreneurs and job-creating companies to see.
To this end, we provided the largest and most comprehensive survey in which we asked leading UK entrepreneurs about their views on the UK, trade and the EU.
YouGov interviewed 1,000 leading entrepreneurs representing UK companies of different sizes and from different sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will come as a surprise to many.
We have found that the overwhelming majority of companies are now trying to export outside of Europe and focus on countries that are modernising and growing while EU countries are stagnating.
They want to see the government prefer new trade ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than scrambling into a long and energetic process of reforming the mysterious European institutions.
When we asked about their views on specific policy areas – from monopoly regulations to product laws –, most entrepreneurs expressed the view that control of these key competencies should be returned to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, and entrepreneurs said that the costs of the Brussels regulation now outweigh the benefits of being part of the European trade area – consent was expressed by even 40% of large enterprises, i.e. traditionally the most pro-European companies.
And finally, our survey of leading companies has revealed the most outspoken knowledge, namely that the unambiguous majority wants Britain to seek a change in the treaty and the relationship with the EU that should be based on trade, not politics.
The findings reveal that companies of different sizes and major business groups have been identified and that the business sector is pressing for a “significant change” that will bring the impact back to Britain.
There’s a lot at stake – achieving a change in the treaty and a better deal for Britain could mean a gain of up to 16% in voting in a referendum to stay in the EU.
The prime minister should not hesitate: this survey shows that Britain’s trade supports its plan to update the terms of UK membership in the EU.
This also shows that the business sector expects this innovation to mark a significant shift from the current balance of forces back to the UK.
A better deal for Britain is possible and, given how the euro area is embarking on a journey towards a closer economic and fiscal union, it is even more necessary.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, and as the results of our survey show, for business this means re-focusing on trade and a fundamental change in the regulatory approach to Brussels.
John Kerry: Spying has gone too far!
The United States has sometimes gone “too far” in espionage, U.S. diplomacy chief John Kerry admitted during a video conference between Washington and London.
However, according to the minister, the collection of information was used to discourage terrorist attacks.
The "First Confession from Washington," according to AFP, sounded amid intense controversy on both sides of the Atlantic because of the scandalous disclosure of mass surveillance by the US National Security Agency (NSA), which was targeted by US allies.
"In some cases, I admit, as President Barack Obama has done, some of these actions have gone too far and we make sure it won't happen in the future," Kerry said.
In the interview, however, he advocated the practice so far.
In his view, the collection of information is necessary to combat terrorism and prevent attacks such as the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, the attacks in Madrid in March 2004 or London in July 2005.
"We prevented aircraft from falling, buildings exploded and people were killed because we were able to be informed about the stockpiles in time," Kerry said.
However, he once again admitted that the collection of information "has gone disproportionately far in some cases".
The affair around U.S. intelligence, which allegedly tracked thousands of phone calls, broke out in Europe this month.
Among other things, it turned out that the Americans also followed the phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
European leaders did not hide their outrage, and some of them called on the European Union to try to reach an agreement with the United States that would predict or significantly limit surveillance.
Alexei Miller from Gazprom says pipeline in Bulgaria is starting a new gas era
The construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria means the launch of one of Europe’s largest energy projects, Gazprom said.
"Today we are witnessing a border: Construction on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun," Gazprom President Alexei Miller said in a statement.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
The South Stream pipeline should add diversity to Russian export routes across Europe.
The contract dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which brings most of Russia’s gas to Europe, adds to the risk of conventional routes, officials say.
Miller says direct connections to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, mean that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are “always” eliminated.
As soon as the entire project starts operating in 2015, Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the South Stream pipeline at a discounted price.
Gazprom says the construction is due to begin in other countries in the direction of the flow at the end of this year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Hezbollah has sent thousands of warriors to Syria.
Awaiting a decisive battle.
The Lebanese Hezbollah movement deployed 15,000 of its fighters north of Damascus in preparation for the decisive battle for the Kalamun Mountains.
Israel reportedly destroyed the missiles intended for Hezbollah on Wednesday in two locations in western Syria.
This Lebanese Shiite organization is fighting in Syria on the side of the army there.
Its agenda is also to fight against Israel, which does not interfere in the Syrian conflict, but has clearly said it will prevent the transfer of weapons to Hezbollah’s hands to Lebanon.
Reports of Wednesday’s Israeli attacks on arms warehouses in western Syria are only getting more accurate.
Israel did not comment on the attack, but was confirmed by U.S. sources.
According to the Syrian website Dampress.com, rockets fired from the Mediterranean area have attacked the Syrian missile base Snúbar Dzabla south of Latakia.
Al-Arabiya news station says two warehouses were hit, in which the missiles were ready to be transported to Lebanon.
According to her sources, it was a Russian-made SA-8 missile.
Israel refused to comment on the report, but military analyst Ron ben Jishai said Syria is constantly trying to supply Hezbollah with rockets and the Syrian air force is teaching members of Hezbollah’s armed section how to handle missiles.
The SA-8 is an outdated missile that the Syrian army has had since the 1980s.
They are located on a movable chassis.
Although relatively primitive, thanks to mobility and small dimensions, it is easy to hide.
They are equipped with a radar, but it turns off after the bullet is fired, so it's hard to target them.
Latakia is located in western Syria, in a region inhabited by ruling alawites.
It is a well-kept area and in the past Hezbollah participated in the fighting in western Syria.
They say they are helping to protect the Syrian Shia community to which they belong.
Now 15,000 of its warriors are reportedly ready to help the army regain Kalamun.
Together with Hezbollah, the Syrian army is also reinforcing its troops there.
Kalamun lies between Damascus and Homs, the third largest city in the country.
According to al-Arabiya sources, the battle is due to be avenged for the recent attack by the opposition on the command of the Syrian Shiite Brigade, Abu Fadl Abbas, in the Shiite part of Damascus.
This year, Hezbollah helped the Syrian army fight back the city of Kusajr on the Lebanese border.
Many insurgents from Kusajr have just gone to Kalamun.
Recently, it seemed that the majority of citizens in the Czech Republic wished for early elections.
The reasons for this have been corruption, money laundering for excessive purchases and public procurement, tax increases and, last but not least, government scandals.
According to the results of the election, it can be concluded that the majority of the citizens were satisfied with this status.
That they didn’t really care about it and with the state that was there (the robbery and debt of this state), they were actually satisfied.
Otherwise, I cannot explain that 3,413,497 voters did not vote, 596,357 voters voted TOP 09,384,174 voters voted ODS total 4,394,028 actually supported the original government coalition, representing 52.16% of all eligible votes.
Which is the majority of the majority.
If the above-mentioned parties are allocated 1,016,829 voters to the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, then with the old order (because all the above-mentioned parties participated in the "stealing" and indebtedness of this state), then 64.23% of the eligible voters actually agreed with this status.
In fact, the majority of voters have said that they are not for the punishment of the culprits theft and indebtedness of this state.
Or do you think that the members of the CSSD who participated in it are based on appropriate laws?
Is he helping us at all?

The Royal Commission learned that two employees of the Christian Young Men’s Association (YMCA) were charged with the charges against Jonathan Lord.
The Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children learned that before charges were filed against child educator Jonathan Lord from Caringbah in 2011, two employees of the Christian Association of Young Men (YMCA) would be found guilty of child abuse in New Zealand.
But before the commission, it was reported that in its opening statement to the commission, the association stated that the case of child sexual abuse had never been resolved in its organization.
Chief Executive Phillip Hare was questioned about the case where one of YMCA's employees was accused of child pornography offences, and the other, when a Caringbah gymnast from YMCA was convicted in 1991 of sexual harassment.
Mr. Hare told Gail Furness, the commission's advisor, that he knew about the first case, but not about the second.
He admitted that YMCA’s introductory statement was also inaccurate when it stated that external audits were carried out in YMCA, which valued YMCA as a leading advocate for children’s rights.
Evidence submitted by the Commission indicates that YMCA has been warned that in the August audit of the Ministry of Education and the Company, it received the second lowest of four possible assessments.
Mr. Hare, who started working with YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that driving from him in the same direction failed when Mr. Lord accepted, without making sure that staff were aware of the obligation to report violations of child safety rules.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual harassment by 12 boys, who he admitted during two years working for YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
Mr. Hare, however, rejected the claim that the YMCA had a cultural problem, which prevented staff from reporting child safety violations by Mr. Lord.
Staff members provided evidence that they had witnessed such violations, including that the Lord was with the children alone, guarding them privately, letting them sit on his knees, telling them he liked them, and letting them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was Lord's subordinate and asked for child safety training because she was worried about his behavior, testified that Jacqui Barnat, the head of children's services at the YMCA in Caringbah, who was Lord's supervisor, was afraid of her "and was afraid of her."
The CEO said he did not accept evidence from staff that they felt unconscious if they were to contact their superiors and report their actions.
Instead, he said that their friendship with Lord obscured their judgment, and therefore they did not report the problem.
Mr. Hare said that he had informed the YMCA Council in New South Wales that the lesson from the organization's "case of Jonathan Lord" was that the staff "did not send any message" and the council agreed with it.
Mr. Hare said the decision to let staff sign a confidentiality agreement shortly after the allegations were made was made by YMCA’s general manager for children’s services, Liam Whitley.
He said the aim was to avoid distortion of evidence, but it was "too hot" and misrepresented.
Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, a child sexual abuse expert, told the committee that YMCA in New South Wales was not a child-safe organization between 2009 and 2011.
He said there were serious problems in recruiting, verifying, employing, training and managing staff.
The hearing was postponed to 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would take the opportunity to return to the post of prime minister, but admitted that the return was unlikely.
In a nightly interview on the occasion of his fifth anniversary of his resignation, 59-year-old politician expressed his views on various areas of domestic policy.
From June 2007, when he resigned from the leadership position after ten years, Mr. Blair mostly avoided talks about British politics and confined his comments to foreign affairs and his role as the ambassador of the Peace Quartet in the Middle East.
When asked if he would return to the post of Prime Minister, his response to London’s Evening Standard newspaper was as follows: “Yes, of course, but it’s probably hard to do that, so...”
While teams of experts gathered in Cardiff to showcase horses to fight for the Horse of the Year prize, it was clear to everyone that the competition would not be easy.
No one was ready for Fenton Kirkland.
Although he is not yet going to school and only a few months ago he took the first steps, this boy and his pet, Shetland Pony Toffee, smoothly swung through three wheels to finally win the main prize and leave behind 30 wrestling dolls.
This inseparable pair – with the same height – was praised at the annual competition run by Sunnybank’s equestrian centre in the village of Rudry near Cardiff for its appearance, behavior and style.
He stood against men and ladies in elegant hats, tipped his bareback in a happy corner and let his two-year-old Toffee walk around the circle.
Fenton was praised by the jury for his natural ability to control the horse far beyond his age.
And Toffee got the highest marks for insight and personality.
Fenton Toffee was given in March for his third birthday and has been practicing with this Shetland pony every day since then.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: “Fenton and Toffee work great together.”
They didn't have much hope, but eventually they left with a golden cup and a flower.
It was only the second time he competed with Toffee, and when he won, we were thrilled.
Everyone considered him phenomenal, and completely strangers wanted to take a picture with him.
A boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale in South Wales walks in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for more than 10 years.
Mrs Howells says: “There was an exciting atmosphere and everyone was encouraged and applauded.”
He ran through the sand throughout the length of the arena, and although he acted so tinyly, he gave a great performance.
Fenton is obsessed with animals – he loves horses, tractors and a farm and has taken care of two chickens.
Given how he started, he'll be back at the Horse of the Year competition soon and I'm sure he'll be doing well.
Speaking at the annual horse show competition, he said, “Fenton is only three, but he already knows how to control a pony.”
Together they form a great team.
The jury picked up Fenton and Toffee for their excellent speech and the way they performed at the competition circuit.
They always watch how good teamwork is between the pony and the one who leads him – and Fenton and Toffee were the best at the oval.
I'm sure that Fenton also helped with the delightful clothes, he really fell there with him.
Too curious newspapers to be investigated
Chinese newspapers, which on the title page asked for the release of the journalist accused of blasphemy, will be thoroughly investigated, the administrator told the press.
New Express newspapers based in Guangzhou have made a rare public request for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he had taken payments to invent stories about a partially state-owned company.
The manager said New Express newspapers will now carry out a “full repair.”
The “repair” order came from the State Administration for Press and Publication, Radio, Film and Television in Kuang-tung Province.
Preliminary investigations showed that between September 2012 and August 2013, New Express newspapers from the Yangcheng group Evening News published several false reports about Zoomlion.
“The editorial board of the New Express newspaper was unsuccessful,” the administrator said in a statement.
He said he had to decide to “approve Chen Yongzhou’s administrative penalty in the form of cancellation of a journalist’s license.”
He also “ordered the Yangcheng Evening News group to make an overall correction to the New Express, and recommended that they investigate the relevant responsible persons in New Express and immediately change the leadership of the New Express.”
Mr. Chen has written several articles for New Express dealing with financial irregularities in a company with a building equipment called Zoomlion.
After he was detained, his newspapers issued two applications for his release on the title page and claimed that he was behind his journalistic work.
Mr. Chen then appeared on state television and confessed to publishing false stories in return.
“In this case, I have harmed Zoomlion and the entire media industry and its ability to gain public trust,” he told CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was striving for money and fame.
I realize I've been acting badly.
After Mr. Chen's apology, he issued a New Express letter on the title page of the apology, stating that he failed to perform adequate checks on his reports.
Recently, several closely watched suspects have been admitted on television.
Experts say that confessions are still being enforced on a regular basis, regardless of the change in this year’s law, which prohibits authorities from forcing anyone to blame themselves.
A drug smuggling tunnel between the United States and Mexico was found on its own railroad.
One of the most ingenious drug smuggling tunnels between the United States and Mexico has emerged, complemented by its own lighting, ventilation and electric railway.
U.S. authorities have described the tunnel as one of the most ingenious secret corridors they have ever discovered.
The tunnel, which spans almost six football pitches, connects the warehouse near Tijuana in Mexico and San Diego in the United States.
This area is full of indeterminate warehouses, where it is easy to hide trucks before they are loaded with drugs.
Authorities said the tunnel had been closed before it could have been unnoticed for drug trafficking.
Along with the discovery of the tunnel, authorities also reportedly detained eight and a half tons of marijuana and about 150 kilograms of cocaine.
Three men who have worked as drivers have been charged with holding marijuana and cocaine to distribute them.
In case of conviction, he faces sentences of imprisonment from 10 years to life.
In the city of Nogales, Arizona, smugglers penetrate extensive drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth largest corridor discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered in October after the harvest of marijuana in central Mexico, which poses a problem in front of drug cartels on how to get their product to consumers as quickly as possible.
In 2010, authorities found a hallway about 650 meters long equipped with rails that led from the kitchen of one house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
The economy and the center connect management.
They offer, for example, a joint advertisement
The new integrated newsroom of Economia in Prague.
Economia took the next step to transform the holding of the Center into its media house.
Since Friday, the Economics and Center has shared top management.
"The unification of the organizational structure and the staff of the Union is essential for the integration of both publishers into the joint media house," comments the changes made by Vice-President of the Board of Economy and Deputy Director General Kamil <0xC4><0x8C>ermák.
<0xC4><0x8C>ermáka, who will be the chairman of the Unified Management, will be supplemented by Andreas Demuth, Managing Director of the Holdings Center.
Pavel Vopa<0xC5><0x99>il was appointed as the new joint director of the store, which is also under the control of the ad director of the two companies, Zuzana Tylcherová.
<0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pán Burda became the new head of information technology.
Vladimír Piská<0xC4><0x8D>ek is the co-director of the editorial board, whose team is also the director of transformation Jakub Unger.
Adela Pitts was commissioned as newly established marketing director.
V<0xC4><0x9B>ra Lhotská is newly managed by the separate body of corporate communication.
The joint financial director is Karel <0xC5><0xBD>alud, managing human resources for both publishers led by Petra Slabá.
“The new organizational structure will allow us, among other things, to come to the market with a common offer of advertising products, better connect the creation of the content of all issued titles and, last but not least, significantly improve the company’s business management,” added <0xC4><0x8C>ermák.
Economia, owned by Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Bakal, has signed a contract for the acquisition of Centrum Holdings and its Czech subsidiaries at the end of April this year.
The Centrum Holdings portfolio consists of the servers Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz, <0xC5><0xBD>ena.cz, web portals, a large e-mail base under the brands Centrum.cz and Atlas.cz and the SME agency Naisto or a portfolio of at least two dozen other smaller websites.
Economia is the publisher of Economic Newspapers, the news server IHNED.cz, the weekly Respekt and Economist and a number of printed and online B2B titles.
Among Czech publishers, he is the most successful in the long term in selling digital versions of his main titles.
This year, in June, the publishing house moved to newly built modern spaces in Prague.
CME is targeting the television business.
It releases almost a quarter of the people.
The media group CME will release.
By the end of the year, he wants to kill a thousand people.
He intends to sense all the side activities and wants to focus only on his main business, television broadcasting.
The group, which owns Nova TV in the Czech Republic and also operates in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia, employs approximately 4,500 people.
Almost a quarter of people lose their jobs.
The media group operates television in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
CME is part of CET 21, which holds a license for the broadcasting of Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fanda, Smíchov, Telka and the Czech version of MTV.
How much the savings will affect the Czech Republic, where the group employs about 650 people, and what this will mean for the domestic TV channel TV Nova, is not yet clear.
"It's premature and we really can't comment on it," said communication director Josef Koukoli<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
According to MF’s information today, a significant resignation of the Czech Republic will certainly not be avoided, but by far the greatest impact should have on the staff status of CME branches in Romania and other countries.
Both Novy’s new bosses Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who came after longtime CEO Adrian Sarbu, spoke during a conference call Wednesday with analysts about their intention to limit all activities that are not directly related to the television business.
It is therefore quite likely that it will significantly reduce, in particular, the cost of producing its own shows, filmmaking and production activities.
In the industrial site of <0xC4><0x8C>KD in Prague, a cooling tower burned at night
A large-capacity tank burned at the <0xC4><0x8C>KD industrial site in Prague, according to the firefighters, apparently a cooling tower.
“The fire started on Thursday at eleven o’clock in the evening, and the fire was still burning this morning,” Prague firefighters spokeswoman Pavlína Adamcová said.
The amount of pests in the air in the surrounding area, as measured, did not exceed the permissible limits.
The amount of damage and the causes of the fire are not yet known.
Approximately five dozen firefighters arrived at the site on Kolben Street.
"This is a fire of a large-capacity tank, probably a cooling tower," Adamco said.
"There is no functional hydrant network in the area, so we fire using the transport line from the tanks," she added.
According to the server tn.cz, extinguishing a malfunctioning network of hydrants was complicated, therefore the firefighters had to transport water away.
The commander of the firefighters declared the second stage of the fire alarm.
Grades are four in total, in the most serious situations the fourth is declared.
The chemists also went to the site to verify the level of hazardous substances that could get into the air during the fire.
"But they did not measure the amount of pests in the air that would exceed hygiene standards," a firefighter spokeswoman said.
British police have given Assange notice of extradition
British police today delivered a notice of the release of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who found refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had delivered a “notification of extradition” to 40-year-old Australan, asking him to come to the police station and that if he did not, he could be threatened with arrest.
Assange exhausted his options under British law when the Supreme Court annulled his appeal against extradition this month, facing extradition to Sweden on charges of sexual offences.
Fearing that Stockholm would take him to the United States, he sought refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19, where he sought asylum from the South American country.
"Scotland Yard has sent a notice of extradition to a 40-year-old man who asks him to come to the police station at the day and time assigned to him," the spokesman said.
Assange continues to violate bail terms.
The embassy refused to comment on the notification of release.
Assange fears that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States, where he may face charges of espionage, as WikiLeaks has published 250,000 U.S. diplomatic documents on its website.
The driver was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 for driving over 200 km/h with a hot drink between his legs.
The driver was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 for driving up to 210 km/h with a hot drink placed between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was spotted on May 27 in his Mercedes Benz on the A120 in Braintree.
When the police stopped him, they found that he had a cup of water between his thighs.
At the Colchester Police Court, Howie admitted to the charge that he was driving discreetly and indiscreetly.
Seven points were added to his account, as a result of which he received a six-month prosecution.
Howie was also ordered to pay a cost of <0xC2><0xA3>90 and an extra charge for the accused <0xC2><0xA3>100.
Due to the tax on foreign property owners, the London bubble crashes
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the tax on the return of financial assets, but is awaiting the final decision of Mr Osborn, who in the 2012 budget introduced a 7% fee for the transfer of property for buildings at a price of more than 2 million pounds and annual fees for buyers who own a single property as a company.
Income from the real estate transfer fee in the Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea districts, which reached <0xC2><0xA3>708 million in tax year 2012/13, already exceeds the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Northeast, Northwest and Yorkdyshire.
Mr Cook said: “Given the increase in the transfer of property to high-value homes and the introduction of related legislation to prevent tax evasion, it is very difficult to argue that high-value property is little taxed regardless of the effect of the outdated taxation system.”
He added that “this move could cause some foreign investors to hesitate to buy properties in London, or even the existing owners to hesitate to sell them.”
Leading real estate – the top 5% to 10% of the housing market by price – in the rich band, ranging from Fulham to Wimbledon, saw a record 11.8% increase last year.
Prices in central London continue to show year-on-year steady growth of 5.6%, but were shadowed by the booming “domestic market” in which Savills real estate agency surveys experienced southwest, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) growth.
Scientists have more illuminated how tail movements are related to the mood of the dog
Previous research has shown that happy dogs drill the tail more to the right (from the dog’s point of view), while nervous dogs tend to have the tail mostly to the left.
Now, however, scientists say that other dogs are able to record and respond to these subtle differences in tail movement.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neurobiologist at the University of Trento, said: “It is well known in humans that the left and right sides of the brain have different connections to stimuli that trigger positive or negative emotions.”
We've been trying to do the same with other species.
He added that, like in humans, the right side of the brain is responsible for left-handed movements and vice versa, and that these two hemispheres play a different role in emotions.
In an effort to learn more about how dogs react to the disproportionate kicking of other dogs, the researchers monitored animals watching movies about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of these animals and analyzed their behavior.
It will probably not take long for us to understand why their tail sometimes goes on one side, and sometimes on the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We have given dogs movies about dogs – whether in a natural version or in the form of a silhouette – to get rid of any deaf stimuli, and we have also been able to adjust the movement of the tail and portray it more to the right or to the left.”
When the animals saw a differently neat dog moving with a tail to the right (from the dog’s point of view, the tail bent), she remained completely calm.
However, when she recorded the shot of the tail mostly to the left (again from the dog’s point of view), their heart rate increased and the animals were acting uncertain.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think that dogs would consciously communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, it is believed that dogs have learned from experience what movements they need to take and which they do not have to pay attention to.
He said: “If you meet dogs several times and the movement of their tail in one direction is repeatedly associated with rather friendly behavior and the movement of the right produces less friendly behavior, you will react based on this experience.”
Researchers say the findings can help owners of dogs, veterinarians and trainers better understand the emotions of their animals.
Dog behavior expert John Bradshaw, a professor of zoology at the University of Bristol, said it was not the first study to examine whether the left and right sides are important to dogs.
Last year, a team at Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right when they look at a happy dog.
And in another expert interview from Victoria University in Canada, he said: “A dog with a robot was more likely to get acquainted with dogs when he spinned his tail to the left than to the right, when they became rather uncertain – the opposite of an Italian study.”
The difference, he said, is that in these different animal studies, dogs in movies or dog robots did not seem to be quite like dogs.
He explained that it could help study how dogs react to real dogs.
"While there is evidence that many different mammals are used on both sides of the brain for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified - and dogs are no exception," he said.
But given how easy it is to record their behavior, it probably won’t take long for us to understand why their tail sometimes goes on one side and on the other.
Arctic Monkeys postponed concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's illness
The Arctic Monkeys rock band postponed a concert in Glasgow after the lead singer was diagnosed with inflammation of the pancreas.
The Sheffield group was scheduled to perform on Friday at the city complex Hydro.
The illness of lead singer Alex Turner, however, forced her to move the performance.
The group's announcement came after it was similarly forced to postpone Thursday's performance at LG Arena in Birmingham.
In a statement on its official website, the Arctic Monkeys group said: “After deciding to postpone today’s performance at LG Arena in Birmingham and on the basis of a medical recommendation, the Arctic Monkeys group must postpone the performance at the Hydro Dungeon 1 complex in Glagolan.
"Alexi Turner has been diagnosed with inflammation of the pancreas and unfortunately will not be able to get out."
The performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on November 20 and the performance at the Hydro complex in Glasgow on November 21.
All tickets for these performances will remain in effect.
We would like to apologize to everyone who bought tickets for the inconvenience that caused them.

Pope Francis appoints first cardinal in February
The Vatican on Thursday announced that Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals to the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22.
The cardinals have the highest position in the clergy of the Catholic Church immediately after the Pope and are the ones who elect the Pope, so Francis will establish his first group of men who will eventually help to choose his successors.
There are now 201 cardinals.
However, once the cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the pope’s election – the group is reduced to 120 cardinals.
In a statement announcing this report, Pope Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said that a meeting of the present cardinals known as the Consistory would take place before the solemn promotion of the new cardinals.
“Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the February Consistory in advance to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinals likely to fall by February.
He said the pope usually nominates as many cardinals as it takes to raise the number of voters to 120 again, and as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wants.
The consortium will be significant next year because it will be the first after Francis was elected in March of this year, Valero said.
At this point, there is a certain orientation towards Europe and especially Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new Pope appoints cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance,” he said.
Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but only a small number of cardinals.
It will also be the first election of cardinals since Francis established the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world, to find ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything for himself.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said it was "perfectly possible" that these cardinals would be asked by the Pope for advice.
But we haven’t been in this situation before – it’s completely new.
Valero said that the popes traditionally elevated the bishops from great places to the position of cardinals, but Francis is “full of surprise – so we don’t know who he is appointing.”
GM Retrieves New Light Trucks in the U.S. Due to Seat Bracket Repair
General Motors is releasing nearly 19,000 of its new (2014) Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra light trucks to repair a manually tilting bracket failure, according to a U.S. auto safety authority on Friday.
For some of these vehicles, the bending mechanism of the front seats may be defective.
As a result, seat brackets do not comply with federal automotive safety standards for headrests.
The announcement on the website of the State Road Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) says that "if the car gets a rear impact, the headrest does not need to properly protect passengers, which increases the risk of an accident".
The downloaded models were produced between August 1st and September 10th.
GM launched delivery in June, and for this leading U.S. car, it is the most important vehicle launch since the restructuring after the bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the delivery owners of the fault in the first half of October.
NHTSA could not review the notification to owners due to a 16-day government malfunction, which weakened car sales growth in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra, which were revamped for 2014 models, rose by about 20 percent in the first 10 months of this year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra models from its vans.
Stocks on the New York Stock Exchange rose by 1.4 percent on Friday afternoon to <0x24>37.47.
Desperate Scream by Obama voters
I voted for Obama twice – I shared the hope of possible change
He says Obama’s sincere efforts have tightened the Republican Party’s obstruction.
Obstruction policy can’t excuse Obama’s health care website’s passions or drone attacks
Obama’s 2008 campaign memoirs are a sad reminder of what could have happened.
Nathaniel P. Morris studied medicine at Harvard in his second year.
These days, I read a very sad book.
I thought about this book that during the cloudy days of my second year of medical school, it would encourage me and restore a spike of hope in me.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" and is a reminder of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish the patient assessments and go to bed in the evening, the book brings me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and your speeches were breathtaking.
The elections ended with a fierce prevalence, and the television news made us think of the historical value of the moment.
My colleagues were crying out for joy, and my parents were hiding the newspapers they got.
A young team of visionaries headed to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During his inauguration in 2008, Obama had 82 percent support.
And here I close the book.
Going to the present is a rough awakening, like waking up from a dream.
It is difficult to remember these optimistic days – they seem to be distant memories, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years after I put in my first ballot, there really was a change.
It was definitely nothing of what I had imagined.
I recognize that Obama has achieved a number of great and diverse achievements – from the law on available care to the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq and the end of the policy of “nothing to say, nothing to say” after the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
In addition, I am convinced that the party obstructions have reversed so much effort to move our nation forward: this includes immigration reform, the possibility of the public to choose health care and the closure of the Guantanamo base.
But after many situations in which I defended the Obama administration from my colleagues and friends, I have reached an absolute limit in terms of the explanations they can provide.
I was in a place of political hopelessness.
The obstructions of the Republicans cannot explain the consent to the listening of foreign leaders or the raids of unmanned planes that kill innocent children overseas.
They cannot explain the fact that the National Security Agency is collecting data on the private lives of Americans, nor the fact that it is harassing those who are revealing the government’s misconduct.
They cannot be held responsible for the execution of Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen, without a proper court, nor for the limitation of public contributions and expenditures during the presidential campaign.
They cannot justify the findings of a report that says the White House’s attempts to silence the media are “more aggressive ... than the Nixon administration.”
And most recently, they can’t apologize for not being able to create a simple website more than 3 years after the signing of the available care law.
I don't know if something like that could have been expected.
At the age of 18, I had an idea that government power might be at odds with the political campaigns that preceded it.
The elected office obviously has no predictable course, and our public talks will form an opposition political party and incidental events like the Newton massacre.
However, all the examples I have given above seem to be largely the result of the administration’s own decision.
And that's what bothers me the most.
I re-elected Obama in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and undeveloped alternative, and it seemed that he could not consolidate his policy or position.
I had the feeling that the second term of office for Obama, free from the pressure of the next elections, would fill the hopes we once heard of.
Yet the return to 2008 – with Obama’s support falling below 45% this week – is becoming increasingly difficult through this book.
It makes me remember the many promises that have been lost.
This week, I read a chapter in the book about how Obama suffered a brutal defeat with Clinton at the primaries in Pennsylvania.
At an additional meeting during the campaign, he told his staff that he had to get back to the pace and remain faithful to his mission.
"I want our magic back," he said.
We must not forget who we are.
Five years have passed, Mr. President, and I totally agree with you.
The ideas expressed in this commentary are exclusively the opinions of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer Says Prime Minister Tony Abbott Is In Conflict of Interest on Parental Holiday Program
Billionaire and MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest over the parental leave program because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
The mining magnate, who is leading a dispute over the payment of a <0x24>6 million tax on coal, made this claim when he tried to get rid of the question of whether he was in a conflict of interest.
Palmer's United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which play a crucial role in deciding whether to collect coal taxes and mining.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could be in conflict of interest, and added that Abbott’s daughters were in a position where they could benefit from the policy.
"He got into a big conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if any of his daughters were pregnant, he would have a direct interest in whether he would get parental leave," Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Election Commission officially declared Palmer the winner of the Fairfax constituency in the Sunshine Coast with a gain of 53 votes.
Mr Palmer called for a review of the election results to accelerate the process.
Daughter of Tony Abbott Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the closure of the polling stations?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why can’t we have a system where you can come, click details on the computer, vote immediately, and get results at midnight?
Mr Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to label ballots.
Is it possible to get the results if someone doesn’t like them?
In these days and at this time, the use of pencils seems incredible.
The Electoral Commission has studied the possibilities of electronic voting and recently made a joint contribution to the discussion with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59, said his political agenda also applies to Sunshine Coast airports and that he would take his new job “very seriously.”
The public service is the public service.
“We are not committed to any reward except that we can serve society at this critical time,” he said.
Do you wash your hands?
Scientists have come to realize that washing your hands will change you and your nose.
The experiment was attended by 98 people, divided into three groups.
The first two were tasked with solving an indestructible task.
Of course, they both failed.
But the group, which failed to wash their hands, had a much more optimistic impression than the one where its participants did not wash their hands.
The "hand-washed" group also performed better in the next test than the other.
However, those who washed their hands achieved worse results in other tests than those who did not wash them.
The results of the "dead" were at the level of the third group, the participants of which had not recorded any previous failures.
The results of the test, according to psychologists, suggest that physical purity actually removes negative feelings after failure.
At the same time, however, the motivation decreases, the tests have to be much more concentrated in further trials.
If we were to transfer the results of the research to the Czech Republic, we would probably be most optimistic after returning from the toilet.
After using the toilet, not only one percent of Czechs and Czechs do not wash their hands, but it is already five percent after the road by urban transport.
Hygiene is also common after work in the garden or in a workshop where 85% of people wash their hands.
The consumption of pets motivates 78.7 percent of people to wash their hands.
Recent research has revealed that there is a difference in the perception of Czechs and Slovaks, how much it is necessary to wash your hands after giving the hand to a stranger.
In this situation, 28.8% of Czechs and 40.3 percent of Slovaks wash their hands.
The study found that both nations wash their hands about ten times a day.
“Although it would be in place, I’m afraid the reality is different and people are trying to make it a little better,” commented dermatologist Klaudia Komárková.
RBS Suspends Two Foreign Currency Traders
According to two persons familiar with the situation, the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) suspends two traders in its foreign currency division, which is another indication that the global investigation by the supervisory authorities concerning suspected currency market machining is increasingly frequent.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are working with competent authorities to investigate the world’s largest financial market, where <0x24>5.3 trillion is exchanged each day.
The two merchants would be the first RBS employees to be suspended as part of an expanding investigation that will respond to the LIBOR (London Interbank Interbank Rate) manipulation scandal.
The bank refused to comment on the suspension, but confirmed that it had received a request for information from the authorities this month.
“Our unwavering quest for the matter continues and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other authorities,” the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the event said that RBS had delivered to the British Financial Behaviour Authority records of emails and instant messages sent from the accounts and to the accounts of the former trader.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is thought to have been released from his current position as European Foreign Exchange President at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, Citi’s European cash trading president, took a leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, former head of currency trading at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these merchants were charged with any offence.
Mr. Usher’s quick-message group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, people dedicated to the event said.
UBS said this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator Finma announced that it had investigated suspected foreign currency machining in several Swiss banks.
At least six offices around the world – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss antitrust agency Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are investigating the claims that these bankers have merged to move with the currency market.
In addition, people familiar with the situation said that HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse had initiated an internal investigation or received a request for information from the competent authorities.
Banks have been browsing for years old fast messages and e-mails to find cases of some violations.
Investigations have alarmed traders in the area, which has been one of the biggest engines for earnings in investment bank closures in recent years, but has been disrupted by the slight instability of currencies that has limited opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to reduce the severity of the situation by claiming that with a large and highly liquid foreign currency market it is essentially impossible to manipulate, but high-ranking traders say that this may not necessarily be true.
A high-ranking trader said that despite the significant volume of day-to-day foreign exchange trading, liquidity spikes between different trading platforms and banks increasing the use of their own internal platforms mean that “you can start to influence the market at relatively low rates.”
The report came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had released a trader from its equity trading department this week, which caused a loss of nearly <0x24>6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank shall immediately notify the competent authorities and shall cooperate with their supervisory authorities.
“We are convinced that this merchant acted on his own and that this problem has been solved,” said Credit Suisse.
The number of people infected with HIV in Prague exceeds 1,000
Doctors in Prague have seen more than a thousand people with HIV.
From the beginning of the observation in 1986 to the end of the third quarter of this year, tests confirmed the disease in a total of 1005 people from the metropolis.
This is based on statistics from the National Reference Laboratory for AIDS of the State Health Institute.
According to her, 2,063 people have been infected throughout the Czech Republic so far.
In 396 cases, immune failure has already erupted.
198 people died.
The number of infections in the Czech Republic has increased annually over the past decade.
In 2002, tests confirmed the infection in 50 people, five years later there were 121.
In 2009, 156 new infections were detected and in 2010, 180 were detected.
The proposed number fell to 153, but last year it was a record high.
According to the lab, there were 212.
“There is no doubt that the total number of newly diagnosed cases this year exceeds 200 this year,” says AIDS expert Miroslav Hlavaty, who has led the Prague House of Light for patients for years.
From October to the end of 2011, tests detected the disease in 39 people and last year in 47, Hlavaty said.
In September, doctors reported 21 new patients and three patients.
From the beginning of the follow-up to the end of September, HIV tests confirmed in 1,710 men and 353 women.
AIDS spread in 161 men and 37 women.
The most infected were in Prague.
Anyone who really wants to know a city should go to a cemetery.
His visit will reveal more than a walk through a paved centre with monuments, churches and galleries, more than the beek would reveal.
Many people read from the graves.
Slowly, cemeteries roar and gain an intimate insight into local reality.
They find out what people live here, what nationalities they are, what religions they belong to, how big and cohesive families they are, how old they die here, how rich they are, how important their titles and professions were to them.
How they express their social positions, what they taste.
And from the state of the tomb, they will find out how they will care for their dead.
U.S. Supreme Court Approved Obama’s Health Care Act
The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the health care law signed by Barack Obama is in line with the constitution, which is a key victory for the Obama administration.
With a 5:4 vote, the court ruled that the individual regulation of the Patient Protection and Accessible Care Act – which commands citizens to purchase health insurance by 2014, otherwise threatens to pay a fine – does not challenge the constitution based on government tax jurisdiction.
President John Roberts stood on the side of four more liberal members of the court, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were in opposition.
The court also supported the remainder of the 2,700-page law and further ruled that the legal requirement for health care, which commands states to extend the possibility of obtaining health insurance, would otherwise threaten to eliminate all funding for health insurance, non-insurance insurance and federal insurance.
The lawsuit for blocking this law was filed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Companies.
During the 2012 primaries, the law strongly rejected each of the main Republican candidates, including the supposedly proposed candidate Mitt Romney.
For the words "Mugabe is a bulletproof ass" no longer threatens prison, the court repealed the law
Until now, the Zimbabweans have had to pay close attention to how they speak in public about the ninety-eighth-year-old Mugabe, who has been ruling the country since the beginning of the 1980s and then at its head since the end of 1987.
According to paragraph 33 of the Criminal Code, for defamation of the presidential office, a fine of <0x24>100 to one year of detention was threatened.
"State representatives should not vehemently accuse people who comment on the president in the halls or in other public places," the Constitutional Court said in a statement.
Nine judges unanimously agreed that the law undermines freedom of expression.
It is likely that the government will appeal against the court’s decision, the British BBC reported.
A number of Zimbabweans, including Tendai Dang, who was arrested by police two years ago for allegedly insulting the president while arguing with a policeman at a bar, were vocal against the law.
In May, an opposition activist was imprisoned, sharing Mugabe's public scam with a "bad ass".
In August, the prosecutor accused a 26-year-old man of his intention to use a poster with Robert Mugabe’s face as a toilet paper.
The court also declared an unconstitutional law restricting freedom of the media.
"The state cannot punish people whose statements will later prove to be false," Deputy Justice Minister Luke Malala said.
So far, Zimbabwe’s law has allowed a person who publishes false information to be sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment.
“The existence of a law allowing to criminalize someone for false statements has a freezing effect on the right to freedom of expression,” Malala added.
Despite the fact that Mugabe has ruled the country hard for more than 33 years, Zimbabwe adopted a new constitution with broader civil liberties in March based on a referendum.
A small step in the direction of the dictatorship of one of the country's men took place in 2009, when an agreement between Mugabe and the opposition took Morgan Tsvangira's prime minister's seat.
However, the country continues to suffer from the economic crisis and until 2008 the world’s highest inflation, which exceeded 100,000 percent.
In 2009, the government completely abolished the national currency.
Currently, Zimbabwe is only used in foreign currencies.
The undermined economy is at the helm of Mugabe’s reckless agricultural reform.
In 2000, he redistributed the land of white farmers among his supporters and war veterans.
Most of them, however, had no experience with walking the farm.
Central banks will keep swap lines permanently
Interim and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the U.S. Fed, the Bank of England and the central banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a permanent instrument that will allow banks to access global currencies whenever they need them.
The banks stated this in their joint statement.
"It's a very sensible move," said Julian Callow, the chief international economist at London's Barclays Bank.
“In the meantime, all the transitional instruments of this type have gradually become permanent, so it’s no surprise to me,” adds Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Benda, chief economist at BH Securities.
Central bankers are strengthening the grip that began in 2007 when the international credit market first collapsed.
The agreements of central banks allowed access to euros, dollars and other currencies to anyone who needed them.
The decision of central bankers comes at a time when the U.S. Fed is preparing to end its program of support for the U.S. economy, which could push the price of money on the global market even higher.
A swap contract is normally used to overcome the liquidity shortage of one currency while the liquidity surplus of the other currency is present.
It can be understood as a stock of one currency and a loan of another currency.
The ECB is launching its third attempt to restore confidence in European banks.
The EU has agreed on banking supervision, the ECB will oversee 150 banks.
How Tipsport (not) deletes personal data.
More than a year ago, I registered on Tipsport.cz.
But I didn’t finish here, because there was someone sitting at the branch who couldn’t complete the registration from the internet.
And since I didn't want to ride to another branch, the registration failed, then I moved, and this changed my address and the number of the passport.
When I wanted to complete the registration later, I was told that it is not possible because I have a different OP number, address and that it simply cannot be completed and that I have to request data deletion and make a new registration.
So I did this and on 24.10.2013 I wrote to technical support that I request that all my personal data be deleted from the database according to the applicable data protection law.
A few days ago, technical support wrote me that I had to complete the registration at the branch.
This started the marathon of e-mails to technical support, where finally after the 4th hurricane on 25.10. they wrote that they had deleted personal data on my request.
So one would say that he could make that new registration and here the problems started again first it wrote to me that my username is already occupied (I understand it wasn't deleted - it's not personal data, but in the end they also deleted this).
So I used another username and jumped on me that my personal data have already been stored in order to complete the registration at the branch (how can they have something that they claim to have deleted?), so I contacted technical support again.
At my question how is it possible to deny me that the personal data were actually deleted on 25.10. and to send me an e-mail with that error.
I did this yesterday (about 3:00 p.m.) and today I was denied that I registered on the same day (31.10.2013) at 13.22 and that it is not possible because I used the same name and date of birth.
I’ve been contacting technical support for a week now and I’m trying to make sure that it’s still not working.
And what about that if it was true what it claims (as it is) no one could register with the same name or the same date of birth if this is already registered.
It was only by the way at 13.22 that I actually registered, on the same name and date of birth, but I used a fictional e-mail and phone number and the world was weird, the page appeared to me that they sent me an e-mail link to complete the registration.
But how is this possible if you cannot register for the same name and date of birth?
Probably because Tipsport binds registration to e-mail and phone number and data simply did not specify as they claim.
So I said this again to the technical support that they are just lying (either intentionally or they don’t know what they’re writing) because what they’re writing is not true.
I have documented several screens that the problem with registration was already before 31.10. so "false" registration does not simply affect this.
Tipsport gave me a strict sentence - I'm sorry, but since you're already re-registered, we can't verify your claim.
And the communication ended.
It repeats the same sentence that the registration is linked to the name and date of birth.
They cannot even accept the fact that the registration was not completed by clicking on that link in the e-mail and thus did not actually take place.
So if I summarize it, Tipsport not only deleted the data as they claim, but still lies when they say otherwise.
Worse still, you can easily prove how they lie and try to make it look like the mistake is on the customer’s side.
By the way, after mentioning this matter on my personal blog, things got a little in motion and from Technical Support email came that they pass the matter for verification and I will be informed (after a week of emergencies and advising and alerting for the same error).
Music plays in the subway on the bridge
Transport company hl. m. (DPP) Prague has launched the project Music in the Metro.
The first vestibule, where the instrumental music played continuously during the operation of the metro, is the A-Line Bridge on the exit to Wenceslas Square.
The test operation will take six months.
Michal Hora<0xC4><0x8D>ek has released his new double album, band and three singers.
The lyricist Michal Hora<0xC4><0x8D>ek brought to the hall of the Cologne City Social House not only his completely new two CD Czech Calendar, but above all in the series Between us the singers Lenku Nová, Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ka Segrad and Ondru Rumla accompanied by the excellent Orchestra Bent<0xC4><0x9B>je.
After the opening intro and the acting studio about the late musician, Michal Horá<0xC4><0x8D>ek gradually invited all three singers to the stage, he himself lost a candle in his hand, thus reminding the story of how they last played in Cologne and in the theater and in the whole city.
"Otherwise in Cologne, there were two kinds of cards that I had come into contact with a lot," he recalled.
He also recalled the cousin of President Zeman.
"Perhaps we could do a tour of Zakolane or Dúbravce near Bratislava," he joked about the parents of other presidents.
Several times in the evening, Horá<0xC4><0x8D>ek, who did not leave the stage and if he did not speak, sat at the chair with a glass of wine, touched his new musical performance.
The calendar was also made by Josef Mánes, who put it on the watch, but at that time he did not know anything about ice hockey, how we meet in those squares and scandalize who does not jump, is not Czech.
That’s the name of a song from the Czech calendar, but we’re not playing for you here today.”
Ondra Ruml, however, sings from this record for him to sleep in the daytime, to sing at night and to accompany her on the guitar.
Otherwise, he would not sing, play percussion, and all three singers would then be accompanied by a band consisting of keyboard, violin cello, guitar and bass.
All three vocalists sang together a little chorus to the side of the sit-hearted heart, which immediately dispersed the scene.
"I'm glad you enjoyed the song, which did not surprise me in Kmoch City," Michal Horá<0xC4><0x8D>ek responded.
After the memory of Petr Hapk, in the presentation of Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ka Segrad, in the original by Richard Müller, rewarded with huge applause, Hanu Heger recalled the song Dad liked Líd Baar and with the Horá<0xC4><0x8D>ka explanation of the communist Ma<0xC5><0xA1>kova and the Nazi Bazarka West.
Composer Michael Kocába recalled the song by Sebastián, Segrado then sang the beautiful song of Prague by Jarda Svoboda, a late-summer native and a former Kolín<0xC5><0x88>ák.
But that was the conclusion, the applause in standing and the addition in the form of an optimistic song We live in a wonderful time.
Another add-on was prepared on the playlist, but the fans did not play it anymore.
Almost immediately after the concert, all four of them sat at the table to sign not only the Czech Calendar, but also an older CD, Michal Horá<0xC4><0x8D>ek, his books and even the packaging from the legendary LP and even took a photo with potential interest.
Berdycha with <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pánk complements Rosol and Hajek
In the final of the Davis Cup against Serbia, the non-playing Czech tennis captain Jaroslav Navrátil nominated four players Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Berdych, Radek <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pánek, Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Rosol, Jan Hájek.
The Czech representatives defend the trophy, but go to play on the opponent’s pitch in the Belgrade Arena, where the match will take place on a hard surface from 15 to 17 November.
The Czechs are third in the final in the last five years.
"We know we're going to the hot ground, that it's going to be wild, and we need to focus as always on our performance."
"We're going there with one goal - to get three points and sell the best," said <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pánek, scoring the winning point in last year's final with Spain.
Secret Wars: Syria, Libya and Iran.
Training for Obama on how to bomb Syria.
U.S. Army in Libya.
TOP GUN in the Persian Gulf.
The Israelis have shown exactly what the bombing of Syria should look like.
Without unnecessary humbug, threats, and millions of statements, the planes were sent, they hit the target and returned.
They did not hesitate to formally dismantle chemical weapons in Syria.
They refuse to confirm the whole action and no longer comment on it.
The exact opposite is confused and generous, the unsubstantiated actions of Obama’s Syrian policy.
And the most satisfactory of all the attack was what the Israelis bombed.
Do not let the media be confused with their claims that the “Syrian base” or “supply for Hezbollah” was bombed.
I recently wrote here that while US aid to the secular insurgents in the country remains only on the rhetorical level, Russia is happy to continue delivering weapons to Syria.
And it was the fresh delivery of Russian rockets landed at the port of Latakia that became the target of the Israeli attack.
A clear message.
And note, Israel again bombed the Assad regime, not the insurgents, although according to popular internet theories it should be the opposite.
The U.S. government has awarded two members of space units, probably the Delta Force.
It has not yet been reported that they were awarded during the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi.
It is known the heroic death of two former SEALs who defended the CIA site in the city, I think they were members of a secret CIA command, which is made up of ex-soldiers.
For a long time, it was speculated what the SEALs were doing at the consulate or even elsewhere in CIA residences.
Now it's clearer.
Anyway, the information that the CIA has its office in Libya protected by gun nests (rightly on one of these two SEALs died after the minonet attack) is relatively surprising.
But even more surprising is the information about the two unknown heroes.
They were part of the U.S. command in Tripoli, and as soon as they received the report of the attack in Bengasi, they volunteered to intervene and, along with five private contractors, set off on their way to the CIA site in Bengasi.
The Obama administration is blaming the fact that during that attack the command was not officially deployed and that it was simply hesitant to do what it did.
Commander, without orders, he'll probably release these volunteers.
Anyway, the fact that the U.S. command, CIA agents and private contractors are operating in the country not once, but permanently is quite interesting.
And that’s because until recently, nothing has been officially admitted, and even now it’s just talking about some kind of NATO consultative mission in Libya.
But it is good that the U.S. is trying to halve terrorism in Libya.
Although it would require much more help to solve the state-wide situation.
The last place of the secret and permanent conflict that I want to write about today is the coast of Iran.
It hasn’t been so long since the media almost chanted Iranian air forces for chasing U.S. drones.
However, little is known about how Americans effectively protect their drones.
Of course, if a drone accidentally manages to appear in the airspace, nothing can be done about it.
However, if Iranian drones are discovered in international space, the situation is completely different.
And so it happened that the Iranian F-4 Phantom aircraft was chasing a US drone in international overseas space, when it may have been the first sharp deployment of the US super fighter F-22 Raptor in history.
The Phantom flew down to visually verify his weapon, without the Phantom registering it on the radar or just noticing it, and then when he suddenly appeared to him and asked the Iranian pilot to return home, the Phantom listened unrepeatedly.
It is no wonder that the Phantom is an American-produced aircraft that remembers the Vietnam War.
It can't be compared to the Raptor.
We want to show that Plze<0xC5><0x88> can still win, promises Ryjotar
It's a little paradoxical.
While his team is mostly failing in recent times, the defender or backer Viktoria Pilsen Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Ryjotaral has the form that gave him a return to the team after a year.
He also gets shots, he is active, after the procedure he was ordered a penalty kick in the match in Teplice.
Victoria scored in the last two rounds against Slavia and in Teplice after the victory, but eventually took one point out of these two duels.
Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Ryjotaral believes that his team in a match with Jablonc will break an unpleasant series.
We want to show that we can win.
"I believe we will defeat Jablonec at home," Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Ryjoral promises.
The team is preparing for a difficult match with the North Americans, who play attacking football, carefully.
Everything goes to the game with Jablonc, the coach prepares us well, as we always draw a lot from the video game of the opponent.
"I believe it will be an excellent match on Friday night," the Czech representative at the Doosan Arena.
The final matches did not go as she wished, but Victoria's word of the crisis is rejected.
So it goes in football, sometimes you're in good shape and sometimes you're in worse shape.
But I wouldn't talk about the crisis at all.
"I believe we will win on Friday and it will be good again," the defender said.
Victoria's team will again rely on the support of fans.
"It's playing on Friday night and that's what I want to invite our fans who are great."
"I believe we're going to pay them a win," Ryjotaral added.
Jana Pet<0xC5><0x99>ová: A step back.
So I decided to take a step back, but when I think about it that way, it's not really a step, but a big leap - a leap back a few years, in memory, into my childhood.
It's a reminder of what it was like, not having any worries and just coming from school and washing dishes, luxuriating and doing tasks.
Although these "obligations", it was mostly just a theory, a parent's wish.
The practice was completely different - to get out of school, throw a bag in the corner and run out.
Playing with other children ball games, jumping pot.
Then, during the series Helena and her boys embroidered with a chain stitch a grandma's birthday dress.
And then after a few warnings to finally wash the dishes, luxuriate, in winter, apply wood to tile stones and tasks to do until after the shading under the lamp (or rely on a comrade and instead of the tasks to write the beloved verses addressed school love).
Breakfast homemade strawberry marmalade (from real fruit, not the ones that are sold now, the content of which was not even owned by strawberries) and drink it with tea from dried herbs that my mother and I so loved to collect.
I also remember those magical evenings, when there was a graveyard silence in the room, when my sister and I were recording songs from the radio on tapes that were loudly rotated in the old tape after my mother.
And then we turned the cartridges around on the pencil, and we kept playing the same song, our favorite one, and we drank it with a siphon.
Or we phoned across the table using tins that were tied to each other by a rope - and when we were talking to hear each other better, it was necessary to thoroughly clean our ears, the then earrings were circus <0x2B> watt.
The minimum wage was more than three times lower than it is now and my parents were able to live from it so that we didn’t miss anything.
We didn’t need those iPhones, iPads or even mobile phones and laptops or branded clothes.
Clothing was inherited from generation to generation and the best "towel" in the closet was a baticated T-shirt of domestic production using SAVA.
From the electronics we were satisfied with the mentioned mother’s tape and the Walkman, which we shared with the sister and which, by the way, we used only on the train on a school trip.
We found it more interesting to play with Aunt Klobouchka Hop or Man, don't get angry, or as I mentioned to go "only" out.
When I was a little older, we got a video player under the tree, my parents probably saved it for a long time, but unfortunately it didn’t warm up at our house for a long time.
My younger sister had a stroller in it, saying that she was so beautifully papalizing the cartridges, so she tried to see if the stroller was sleeping.
Unfortunately, he slept, but it was his last bite.
Well, and this has happened to this day, poor man, on dad's plate all the time.
She says that when Lenka was a little girl, she put a dick in the video and thought she was going to play the recipe and she didn't lose, so she can't keep it up to date.
I remember how we were able to communicate with each other, to negotiate without a mobile phone, computer.
My sister and I agreed with the neighbor’s granddaughter on the holidays at Grandma’s, when we would meet again next summer at Grandma’s – and so it was, so it was.
We got together.
Do you promise to meet someone in a year?
I also remember the winter when we ran out with the whole village, built snowflakes, riding on a snowdrop near the church on bags covered in ashes.
Then we had dinner with the whole family and talked about the past few days.
Of course, my sister and I were listening to the notoriously well-known phrase before each dinner: "Begin to wash your hands!"
Yes, it still applies today, but you certainly don’t have soap attached to the tub in the net from lemons.
After dinner, when my father was "working" in the garage with Jarda from the village, my mother and I lay on the floor, hung our feet on the tile, opened the door and knocked on the flames, and listened to the cracking of wood that linned from the stone.
We were closer - really - we didn't count how many friends we had on the social network, we knew how many friends we had, the real ones!
We communicated - we talked - we didn't text each day through different cabins, SMS.
There was no such thing, and yet we knew a lot more about each other.
And that's how I could go on for a long time.
It’s nice to remember, especially if I add to these memories by looking at the albums where black and white photos are carefully glued to black corners.
And if I didn't know how old I was then, there's always a year behind the photo.
I see that although our sister-in-laws didn’t listen much to the pot and we also had two-numbered pants after the brother, no one laughed at us before, it was so normal (not IN).
And I'd rather go back to that step forward - into reality.
Until 2013 and I’ll wait for what the modern age will come up with, for example, once for my children.
What I know for sure is that these memories are now for a young teenage generation so at least somewhere "one hundred years behind the monkey" and I think they're losing a lot that they're not going to experience this "predatory" time either.
I wish they did!
Google, Samsung and Huawei sued for patents by Nortel
The group, which owns thousands of patents lost to Nortel, filed a lawsuit Thursday for patent infringement against mobile phone manufacturers including Google, the company it oversold at the auction in the wake of Nortel's bankruptcy.
The Rockstar consortium, which bought patents for <0x24>4.5 billion from Nortel, sued Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and four other companies in Texas for patent infringement.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
Patents include technology that helps link search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, the lawsuit states, which is at the heart of Google’s search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately reached.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making phones that work on Google’s Android operating system, which is heavily competing with Apple and Microsoft’s mobile products.
In 2011, Google made a <0x24>900 million standard price offer for Nortel’s patents.
Google has increased its offer several times and eventually offered up to <0x24>4.4 billion.
After Nortel was defeated by Rockstar in the battle for patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for <0x24>12.5 billion, which was partly motivated by Motorola's patent group.
“Despite the failure of attempting to obtain patents at auction, which are the subject of the dispute, Google has violated and continues to violate the patents,” the lawsuit said.
Rockstar is seeking increased damages from Google because it says it is committing a patent infringement by Google intentionally, according to the lawsuit.
Miloslava Cejpková: The November Smile
She came from outside, from four degrees Celsius, which we're not used to yet.
First she put a smile on her face, the one she was always putting on as a defense against the pleasures of a friendly environment.
This made her very relieved because it was a mask she decided not to postpone in public.
He was honest at home only when he was a grandmother and had grandchildren Elika or Adik around him.
And of course, when her sons called her.
She remembers the lesson from the endless courses of business skills.
Now they've finally really done it.
Not to disturb your neighbors.
Then he flew into the corner.
Like a dress on a mask.
November, no other moon can do the miracle of smiling really, like when they were on a trip with the one who hasn’t been there for almost three years.
Egypt appoints first freely elected president to the office
Mohammad Mursi made his inaugural oath, but his triumphant day is hardly ending the political unrest in Egypt.
Islamist Muhammad Mursi promised “new Egypt” when he was formally appointed as the country’s first freely elected president, after Husni Mubarak, who had been deposed 16 months earlier.
When he was brought to office before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamic president in the Arab world and the fifth head of state of Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He took an oath before 18 judges dressed in black talars in a building overlooking the Nile that resembled an ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are striving for a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic,” Mursi said at a ceremony broadcast live on state television.
"The Egyptian people today laid the foundation for a new life - absolute freedom, true democracy and stability," said Mursi, a 60-year-old U.S.-trained engineer and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been a single illegal organization for the past 84 years.
When Mursi arrived shortly after 11 a.m. local time in a small car column, hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building.
Only a few hundred supporters met in front of the building to celebrate the president, and unlike Mubarak’s presidency, traffic was only briefly stopped so that the column project could usually be moved along a busy road connecting the city centre with suburbs in the south.
Mursi’s personal prestige, ridiculously referred to as the uncharismatic “reserve tyre” of the Muslim Brotherhood, has grown sharply since his victory and his Friday speech, which aimed to present him not only as a candidate of Islamists, but also to all those who want to join the Mujahideen.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Mursi said, wearing a blue social outfit with a red tie to the judges in a wooden-covered chamber where he swore an oath.
Mursi later traveled to the University of Cairo, where he was to give an inaugural speech.
While he was in observation, he received an official welcome from a military band that played the national anthem.
The military commander was Field Marshal Hussain Tantavi.
His arrival was accompanied by a scandal "the army and the people are one hand" from the mouths of hundreds of people gathered in the university's main lecture hall.
The University of Cairo was founded in 1908 as a center of secular education and later in the 1970s became the backdrop of Islamic student movements.
On Friday, Mursi made a symbolic oath on Tahrir Square, where the revolution was born, which ended the authoritarian government of Mubarak last year, and solemnly promised to recapture the presidential powers taken from his office by the military council, which is out of control.
But by agreeing to make an official oath before the court, rather than before the parliament, as usual, he has submitted to the will of the army, indicating that the struggle for power will continue.
Mursi’s speech on Tahrir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
There will probably be police specialists in the ghettos, they're supposed to ease the tension
Police specialists should be involved in the ghettos in the Czech Republic in the future.
They would spend up to half of their trips here.
They would look at the order and solve problems.
Thanks to their knowledge, the environment should contribute to reducing the tensions between people from poorer places and the inhabitants of the surrounding area.
In its proposal to reduce security risks, the Ministry of the Interior expects to do so.
According to him, the improvement of the situation in the country would mainly help "acceleration of social housing".
The document was discussed by the government.
According to the analysis, there were about 300 poor homes and quarters in the Czech Republic a few years ago.
There were more than 80,000 people, especially the Romans.
Adults in the ghettos were out of work, families were dependent on doses, children were enrolled in "special" schools.
They're dead bodies.
According to experts on the problem sites, in the meantime, it has increased by 100.
Relationships between their residents and others are intensifying.
There were anti-Roman marches in several places.
The extremists were also joined by the people around them.
According to the interior, it is difficult for the police in areas with ghetto security and order to maintain.
The essential condition is the "consistent application of equal access to law enforcement".
However, without a detailed knowledge of the place and people, it is impossible to achieve this.
The specialist would go on tours in the ghetto, where he would spend up to half of his service, the rest he would serve in his district.
He'd be watching the order in the trouble zone.
He would also know the locals, so he could better solve problems or violations.
"Thanks to committed trust, specialists will be able to prevent a number of illegal acts more easily," the statement said.
Ghetto specialists would receive additional fees, namely 500 to 1000 kroner per month.
The deployment of special police officers to the problem areas is to be paid from the Norwegian funds.
The budget is about 600,000 euros (now about 15.5 million kronor).
The Czech Republic pays 15 per cent of the sum, the funds 85 per cent.
The preparations started this year, now a detailed proposal is being prepared.
The project is expected to last until 2016.
The authors were inspired by the neighbors.
This mechanism has been successfully applied in Slovakia for several years, where the problem with socially excluded sites is incomparably higher than in the Czech Republic.
"There are so-called Roma settlements here," the authors of the report said.
How many specialists there should be in the Czech Republic is not yet clear.
The answer should be an analysis that determines the places where a special policeman would be needed.
It will also depend on how much money these members will be able to be released annually by the police after the end of the project.
According to the proposal of the project, first the selected police officers complete an internship in Slovakia.
This training is expected to be carried out annually by five dozen members.
The best candidates will be chosen.
There should also be special training for police officers who will be active in the ghettos.
According to the authors, social housing would mainly help to improve the situation.
It should motivate and lead to integration.
According to the interior, there are three categories.
Minimum standard would meet hostels with precise rules, such as the number of persons per room.
The average standard would be in smaller apartments.
Higher standards should be social apartments that would be comparable to ordinary housing.
The tenants would have to comply with the integration plan, which would be drawn up with them by the social workers.
They should follow the accommodation schedule, take care of their health, send children to school, requalify and actively look for work.
If they tried to integrate, they would move to a higher standard of living.
According to the interior, the system of transparent housing should work for at least 30 years until the next generation grows "in a pro-integration-motivated environment".
The model of social housing is prepared by resorts for local development and work.
They have to design it by the end of the year.
Karel Drabek: Uhlírsk<0xC3><0xBD> vrch - one of our youngest volcanoes.
Uhlírsk<0xC3><0xBD> vrch is a notable hill 3 km southeast of Bruntal.
Along with several others, the evidence of volcanic activity in the Lower Jeseník at the time (from a geological point of view) is recent.
The last eruptions were at the beginning of the quarter.
At the top of Uhlí<0xC5><0x99>sk<0xC3><0xBD> summit is a striking white-embodied Baroque pilgrimage church of the Virgin Mary, built in 1755 - 1765.
He replaced the original wooden chapel.
The host who was standing next to the church did not stay.
Shortly after the completion of the church, the alley was laid off from four rows of lip, about 1 km long.
The crossroads on Uhlí<0xC5><0x99>ské vrtu is already the third version, the original was there after 1916, the second, from 2001 only lasted until 2004.
At fifteen stops are wooden plastics made by the local art carpenter Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Nedomlel.
He used various types of wood from the Lower Autumn area.
Similarly, the substations from the mountains of the area form an interesting geological exhibition.
At each stop, the name of the sponsor is also indicated.
The Carbon Hill is the rest of the young volcano.
Although data from radiometric age measurements vary slightly, the last eruption here was about 1.5 million years ago.
He is therefore younger than the Big Red (3.3 million years old) and older than the Venus volcano (0.8 million years old).
The volcano was born an explosion.
In it she cast a considerable amount of volcanic ash along with fragments of the rocks from the floor, which by burning gained a reddish-brown color.
At the end of this stage, the lava surface was extinguished - today it is a layer of porous brush up to 13 meters strong.
The second eruption threw out red, brown, and black spots of tuff.
Their layer is strong up to 50 meters and part of it is accessible in the wall of the fracture.
In the tufts, visible volcanic bumps are up to 1 meter. Even the second eruption was ended with lava spills.
At the end of the activity, a lava emerged from the volcano, which today forms up to 50 m of a strong layer of struskovi<0xC4><0x87>e <0xC4><0x8C>e<0xC5><0xA1>tí.
Volcanoes that alternate the formation of volcanic ash with lava flows are the most common type of volcanoes.
Because they are actually made up of layers, they got the name stratovolcanoes.
The original volcanic cone was gradually eroded.
However, he was threatened only by mining the mines in the breakdown on the south side.
The most intensive mining was carried out in the years 1953-1962.
Tufs were added to concrete, which was then lighter and had better thermal insulation properties.
The mine was managed to stop under the pressure of experts and the public, thus preserving this unique place.
The problem, however, is the porosity and the small consistency of the mountains, which quickly ventilate, break down and dry downwards.
Lom disappears relatively quickly.
To make the situation even more complicated, a warm, south-oriented slope is an ideal place for some rare species of plants and animals.
The correction is therefore problematic, but over time it will be necessary to select and maintain a characteristic geological profile.
This is nothing new, similar profiles are maintained in a number of important locations.
On Uhlírsk<0xC3><0xBD> vrch you will get to the green tourist mark from Bruntal, or from Slezsk<0xC3><0xBD> Ko<0xC4><0x8D>ov.
Drivers can use unpaid parking at the beginning of Lip avenue, where the short learning trail also begins.
She moved from the villa to the pantry.
Ivana grew up and spent most of her life in an active villa with a garden and swimming pool in one of the most beautiful Prague villas in O<0xC5><0x99>echovce.
The original owners of the house, however, got it back in restitution and the tenants had to move away with a small deviation.
Ivana was looking for a replacement home for herself and her older mother at the time.
From acquaintances she received a tip on apartment 3 <0x2B> kk in an older panel house on the opposite side of Prague.
"At first, it was a shock, but the view from the fourth floor of the large forest park and dam inspired me to the other side," Ivana recalls.
At first, I thought it would be a provisional for three years.
"We live here for more than thirteen years today and I wouldn't change because of the gradual reconstruction," the owner adds.
The mother and daughter then moved from the one hundred and twenty-six-meter apartment to a smaller apartment with an area of 62 m2 and almost all the equipment was distributed.
The action was not simple, things were stored with friends and the gradual arrangement took almost a year.
The new apartment was in relatively good condition, but necessary adjustments had to be undertaken, such as the varnish of the doors or the replacement of the windows.
The previous owner drilled the nucleus, however, the owner most bothered the impractically solved and unnecessary large hall, and vice versa a small bathroom.
The combination of the two rooms created a multifunctional living space.
Architects used to define individual zones and breakdown of the room plasterboard, which allowed a new placement of lights.
The first intervention she decided to do after a few years was to remove the strand in the living room.
This changed the layout of the apartment to 2 <0x2B> kk, but the room got airy and opened panoramic views of the surrounding greenery.
The next step towards partial improvement of the standard was to replace the PVC floor with a laminate.
Ivan didn't know how to use the bathroom.
For years, I took away magazines about housing and looked for inspiration.
In one of them, I recently discovered an interesting realization.
So I contacted the young architect Kamila Doud<0xC4><0x9B>rova on the recommendation.
“It was actually the most important step in the future,” says Ivana.
Thanks to the restructuring of the bathroom, it was also possible to adjust the available hallways.
The architect combined the space of the toilet and the bathroom and replaced two doors with open wings with one sliding, saving space.
The bathroom is timeless and also sufficiently barrier-free.
High-quality linings mimic the sandbox, in the shower there is also a comfortable seat, with a bidet sprinkler.
The successful collaboration with Kamila Doud<0xC4><0x9B>rova continued.
Within the program How to Build a Dream, a quick but essential change took place in the living room, which was also attended by the architect Martin <0xC4><0x8C>enek.
In the space that was created by connecting two smaller rooms, we had to get three functions, dining, living and sleeping, without being helped by the classic principles of optical division, such as semi-finished or Japanese walls.
"As a result, this would violate the openness and unity of space," explains the architect.
Originally it was possible to separate the bedroom and the living room.
It was enough to turn the backs of two sofas and build a custom-made box for springs between them.
The dining area defines the shades of the floor and paint.
On the floor in the kitchen and dining room the architect used quality marmoleum, the sliding door revived the wallpaper with a pattern.
The kitchenette covers sliding panels with wallpaper if necessary.
The new anti-allergic marble floor has a number of advantages compared to the previous laminate: a softer non-slip surface without buckles and better sound insulation.
The system of deflections and blinds made of silk cardboard highlighted in color is an example of how to work with the space in the panel.
I left the colors on the architects, I wished it was happy.
"I like orange, I had the same shade in the previous apartment," says Ivana.
The graffiti cover with a floral magnolia motif is practical and creates a distinctive aesthetic element.
To the warm energy tone, architects chose white, which underlined the modern functional style.
In a small apartment, it was possible to store books, among other things, in the space under the window umbrella.
Everything is within reach, the lamps are conveniently controlled remotely.
In the divided interior, the contrast between the new and the old, for example with a decades-old crystal mirror, and the quality artifacts that Ivana collects all her life.
The last one came to the kitchen.
The cabinets were previously placed on both sides and the owner felt a bit like in the tunnel.
The architect took their number and reorganized the layout.
Furniture in a simple design is custom made, the white surface softens the slightly pearly surface.
They entered the small space thanks to the inventive solution of a washing machine, a dryer and a dishwasher.
The appearance of the small kitchen revived the whole glass ceiling of the walls above the worktop.
Unique graphic glass with a digitally printed motif is attractive, in addition, it is excellently maintained.
Ivana chose magnolia flowers that remind her of her favorite neighborhood where she lived for years.
Now she seems to be happy here too.
In the original bathroom there was a small bathtub and sink, the new owner chose a neutral shade of lining.
The large shower area has a glass door Ronald.
The task was to create a clear, simple space from the given environment, in which the functions and equipment will be in harmony.
We have combined the interior materially and colorfully and tried for its elegant, cozy, not too crowded appearance.
“The next requirement for the entry was a barrier-free solution with a minimum of obstacles and the possibility of easy movement around the furniture and accessibility of everyday items,” adds Kamila Doud<0xC4><0x9B>rová.
The Supreme Court has ruled that they can be prosecuted in no time.
The Supreme Court ruled that former Prime Minister Petr Neczae could also be prosecuted for any crimes that could have been committed before the House of Representatives was dissolved in August.
He was protected only by procedural immunity, which applies to speeches in the House.
In the case of former ODS MEPs Ivan Fuksy, Mark <0xC5><0xA0>najdra and Petr Tlucho<0xC5><0x99>e, on the contrary, decided that they could not be punished for any crimes until they gave up their parliamentary mandate last November, said spokesman of the Supreme Court Petr Knötig.
The court rejected the motion by the state prosecutor Iva I<0xC5><0xA1>tvan, who wanted to continue the criminal proceedings with the Member.
According to him, they accepted a fee in the form of lucrative posts in state firms for giving up their mandate and not having trouble passing laws.
On the contrary, the former prime minister who offered them these posts can be prosecuted.
Vít Bárta also detained an anti-corruption police officer
Bart's lawyer Old<0xC5><0x99>ich Chudoba, who represented her even in the case of alleged corruption of VV MPs, also did not want to express himself too much about the case, but said: "Yes, I represent the client in this case, but in view of the protection of the hidden facts."
According to the Law, the case is handled by the General Inspectorate of Security Corps (GIBS).
The server tn.cz said that Bárta could buy classified information from the police.
According to the server prvnizpravy.cz, the case may have been related to the case of former police president Petr Lessy, whose appointment he allegedly sought as Bart.
The latest information, however, shows that the detention of Vít Bárta is not related to Petr Lessy.
A spokeswoman for the police office, Eva Kropá<0xC4><0x8D>ová, declined to comment on the matter with the Prague City Prosecutor’s Office dealing with the case.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of secret facts," said Pravu spokeswoman of the Municipal Prosecutor's Office in Prague <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pánka Zenklová on Friday.
It is the prosecutor there who is overseeing Bart’s case, and thus its words indirectly show that the file or criminal proceedings are conducted in the secrecy regime.
The reporter Novinek managed to reach the wife of Víta Bárta Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Klasnová in the morning in front of their residence in the Prague Klara.
She was just packing her suitcases in the car and leaving.
She refused to comment on the whole event.
On Friday morning, Tomio Okamura, the leader of the Dawn movement, expressed concern for Bart's detention.
He, in his own words, does not know what the cause is all about.
"Vit Bárta was one of the many candidates of many parties to our candidate, and as I have repeatedly said before the elections, he was not even a member of the Dawn of Direct Democracy Tomia Okamura," he added.
Vít Bárta, who failed to run for Tomia Okamura’s Direct Democracy Movement in the last early elections in the Plze<0xC5><0x88> region, is known for its corrupt cause of paying MEPs for public affairs.
In April 2012, he was inadvertently sentenced to 18 months with a delay of 30 months.
Afterwards, the verdict was changed and Bart was dismissed.
I want a contract in the NHL.
Juice, desire and enthusiasm I still have
For Prospal, her family has always been in the first place, so she wants to be completely submissive to her at the age of 38.
Either he gets a job overseas and continues his career, or he ends up with hockey.
"I want to play the role of father and husband."
"I'm really looking forward to that," says the hockey player, who is still waiting for the offer.
In spite of the fact that he's a self-employed worker who never gets a job.
Despite the fact that he keeps his heart on the ice every time and he can beat his fellow players.
And also despite the fact that he was Columbus' most productive player last season.
"But the desire to show everyone in me is still there," he says decisively.
The New York Rangers, who have not been able to enter the season, may be waiting for him, and they also have two backers injured - attackers Rick Nashe and Ryan Callahan.
What does it look like when you get to the Rangers?
It's just speculation.
Until I have something on paper, it's not worth taking care of.
I know there's an article in the New York Post that should sign me, but that's all.
Nowhere has it been added that this really happened.
Unfortunately, I'd like to announce myself that I have a contract, but it just isn't.
You haven't even been called from the club?
Such communication in the NHL takes place daily.
It’s about getting into a situation where the deal really comes to an end.
For example, when a player gets hurt or someone else doesn't get hurt and the handcuff doesn't hurt.
There are a lot of different factors that need to come together to get this contract.
But in New York, there's a similar situation, right?
Rick Nash is injured with Ryan Callahan and the team didn't get into the season, so there's a certain chance, don't you think?
Of course, that chance is always there.
The second thing is that you always need two sides.
I'd take a lot of offers today, but I haven't got any yet.
This is the reality I have to live in.
You're flying to America on Friday, you're expecting something to hit, right?
I’ve had those expectations since July 5, when the freelance market opened in the NHL, and still nothing.
Are you going to New York to remember?
I'm going to Tampa for kids and my wife.
I'm looking forward to the sun and seeing you again.
Do you have a plan for your program?
That's because I'm a father and a husband, and it all depends on that.
I'm not a hockey player at the moment - I don't have a contract and I don't play games.
So I'm going to play the role of dad and husband, and I'm really looking forward to that.
Yours already has two hockey games on Sunday, which is a holiday for me and my whole family, when we can go to support our children in what they want to do.
Do you think you could do this in full-time imports?
Sure, you can think about a lot of things.
This can happen, too.
I tried it three years ago when I missed 50 games for knee surgery.
And I had a lot of fun.
Once it gets to such a stage that all the goals, wins and entries will not replace what you have at home.
Because family and children, that's the meaning of life.
You have the job you want.
I had a job that was the most beautiful thing I could ever meet except my family.
Have you had a lot of offers from Europe: do you want to play the NHL just because it’s the NHL, or is it because of the family that you want to be in America?
Since I am a hockey player, the first place - besides the family - is also sporting success.
The NHL is the best competition in the world.
And from that also comes family life.
My children, so sorry, our children - my and my wives - grew up in the United States, started going to school there and so on.
And we'd be very happy if they continued on this trend.
Because what we're going to do is there's a chance in America somewhere else.
We should offer them a chance like this.
So you're planning to stay in America permanently?
We're going to practice it like we've done so far.
This means that in the summer we will be in the Czech Republic on Hluboké and in the vicinity of <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice.
And in winter again in Tampa or where our steps will lead us.
It’s perfect to be always warm.
I've had a lot of luck in my life.
It can be said that I went against him, it took a lot of strength and resignation, and it took me a lot of things that I missed.
But hockey in return offered me a lot of options and this is one of them.
That my wife and I can choose where we live.
There's a lot of people in the world who'll sneak after this, so they can choose what they're going to do and how they're going to live.
How long in yourself will you have the will to work out, work hard, and wait for an offer at your age?
Yeah, so that's a question I can't answer.
Today I still have it in me, the juice, the desire, the passion, the passion for the sport. The desire and the motivation to prove to people that you still have in the NHL that I am always better than anyone else.
But I can't tell you how long it will stay there.
It can't be planned.
So you can say that this season you're waiting for how it's going to work out, and then you decide what's next?
I'm in a phase where I'm going day by day.
Recently, the CEO of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ announced that the decision to build the 3rd and 4th blocks of Temelín will be postponed until the end of 2014 or 2015.
He justified this by awaiting a new State Energy Concept and agreeing to Contracts of Difference by the government.
For these reasons, the current management of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ is trying to transfer its responsibility to the government - that is, to the majority shareholder.
However, a qualified manager should give shareholders a recommendation, not hide behind it.
Grandma: I only rule with Sobotka.
Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> is beginning to reconcile that his YES movement will not have time to learn political craft in the opposition and that it will have to go straight into the government to create any.
The President admitted this in an interview for the Law that will come out tomorrow.
<0xC5><0xA0>koFINu is led by Abraham
Its competences include the product and marketing area and the strengthening of cooperation with business partners.
He was replaced by Crazy Hunter.
For the past 14 years, Abraham has linked his professional career with the automotive sector.
He worked at Toyota Motor Czech, then at Fiat Czech Republic, where he was responsible for the Alfa Romeo brand and dealers for seven years.
His last location was Suzuki Motor Czech, where he held the position of manager of the automotive division for over five years.
<0xC5><0xA0>koFIN was founded in 1992.
Police evacuate part of Los Angeles airport after shooting
It was shot at Los Angeles International Airport this morning.
Police evacuated part of the airport, which is said to be terminal three.
Reuters, citing California media reports, said the lawmakers shot a gunman with a gun.
The Los Angeles Times, referring to the police, said there was a shooting in which two to three members of the Department of Transportation Security were injured.
How many people have been injured and whether there are any casualties is still unclear.
The firefighters are talking about the incident with more people injured.
CNN: Israel bombed a military base in Syria.
The target was Russian missiles for Hezbollah.
Israeli military aircraft allegedly bombed a military base near the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday.
With an appeal to the unnamed agent of the U.S. government, CNN announced it.
The Israeli press has reported extensively about the alleged explosion at the rocket warehouse, but the Israeli government has not confirmed the attack.
A spokesman for the Israeli army on CNN declined to comment on the incident.
"We are not expressing ourselves to foreign media reports," she said.
The target of the Israeli attack was, according to a U.S. government source, rockets and related equipment that, in Israeli opinion, could be transported to the militant Lebanese movement Hezbollah.
The AP agency, referring to another U.S. security official, reported that the target of the Israeli attack on the Syrian territory was the Russian SA-125 missiles.
The second Israeli television channel reported that the target of the attack was allegedly a highly modern Syrian air defense system.
Satellite images of the area of the attack, but according to the DPA, showed batteries of Russian S-125 Neva rockets.
In addition, they were said to have seen the batteries of SA-3 rockets, including a command center with a radar to monitor the rockets and their targets.
According to Israeli television reports, the missiles are 35 kilometres [35 kilometres] down and could carry a head weighing 70 kilograms.
Israel has allegedly bombed missile deliveries inside Syria at least twice this year, CNN and AP said.
The Israeli military has never responded to such reports, but has repeatedly declared that it will attack any supply of weapons targeted by Hezbollah or other groups designated as terrorists.
Is the Internet the end of travel agencies?
Flight Centre seems to be successfully resisting this trend.
The company has updated its annual profit estimate and expects record earnings from recreationists in Australia and the UK.
The travel agency now expects its annual base profit before tax to range from <0x24>325 million to <0x24>340 million, compared with <0x24>305 million to <0x24>315 million from the previous forecast.
If current developments are maintained, this will represent a 12 to 17 percent increase against a record <0x24>290.4 million profit from 2011/12.
Chief Executive Officer Graham Turner said Flight Centre generated an eight percent profit in the first half of the year and in the second half of the year began with a sharp growth mainly in Australian and British travel outside of business travel.
“To date, our 10 countries are profitable and several are heading towards a record yearly profit before interest and tax,” he said.
These include Australia and the United Kingdom, which have traditionally been our biggest earners.
Businesses with recreational activities grew in Australia during the second half of the year, offsetting a slightly weaker domestic market for business travel.
Similarly in the UK, Flight Centre did well in the recreational area, while business clients spent less.
The U.S. trade recovered after losing in a seasonally weakened half-year and is expected to bring the third consecutive year-round profit.
Flight Centre’s shares were 3 cents higher yesterday at <0x24>38.20.
Greenpeace activists detained in Russia have been transported to St. Petersburg
Environmental activists detained in Russia since September for protesting planned oil production in the Arctic have been transported from Murmansk to Saint Petersburg.
This was reported today by AFP with an appeal to the international environmental organization Greenpeace.
At the same time, it claims that the original allegations of its piracy activists have not yet been withdrawn.
"Greenpeace International learned from diplomatic sources that 30 men and women detained in Russia after a non-violent action against the Arctic oil platform were transported from a Murmansk correctional facility to a prison in Saint Petersburg," the organization said in a statement.
The reasons for the relocation of the detained activists are unclear; according to the DPA, it was a planned relocation.
The ecological authorities first accused them of piracy, for which they were threatened with up to 15 years in prison if convicted.
Last week, however, they announced that the charge would replace this with a milder resentment, for which there is a risk of a lower penalty with a seven-year-high limit of detention.
But Greenpeace said in a statement today that the authorities' piracy charges have not yet been met as they promised.
This means that the arrests are now charged with two crimes.
Last week, the Powerful Investigation Committee announced that piracy charges would be replaced with corruption charges.
But when the thirty prisoners stood before the committee this week, the piracy charges were not removed.
Instead, a new charge has been filed against everyone,” Greenpeace said in a statement.
The Russians detained three dozen Greenpeace members from 18 countries at Gazprom’s oil platform in mid-September.
Ecologists were on board the Arctic Sunrise, which was flying under the Dutch flag.
Since then, everyone has been held in custody against which they have appealed, but the court has rejected them all.
The ecologists complain about the conditions of imprisonment.
Greenpeace CEO Kumi Naidoo said the move to Saint Petersburg would facilitate meetings with the detainees and consular staff.
However, there is no guarantee that the conditions in the new prison will be better than in Murmansk.
"In fact, they can be worse," he warned.
One of the detained activists, Faiz Oulahsen, asked for help from King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands.
In a hand-written letter published today by Algemeen Dagblad, the monarch urged him to discuss their situation at a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
It claims that Maliki has a large share in the restoration of sectarian violence in Iraq, which is said to be part of the fighting in neighboring Syria.
Schools should focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
During the lessons of English literature, you will need to study at least one of Shakespeare’s plays, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and the contemporary British illumination from 1914 onwards.
The exam will also include “hidden text” to motivate deeper reading;
Combined English literature and language courses will be cancelled.
Starting in 2015, students will be required to have a language graduate exam and will be invited to choose English literature as an optional subject.
The Ministry of Education is expected to release new foundations for English and mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects to undergo radical change.
For other key topics, changes are expected next year.
In a separate step, the office of Ofqual, which oversees the graduation exams, will reveal changes in the structure of the graduation exam, along with a new system of marking and a smaller volume of projects for students.
In his speech this summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said there is “a broad consensus on whether we need to reform our testing system in order to regain the trust of society,” and that it is necessary to insist more on making the exam more “delicate and ambitious.”
Studies show that English schools spend less time on math — 116 hours a year or three hours a week — than most other countries.
In Australia, mathematicians spend an average of 143 hours a year compared to 138 hours in Singapore.
Although there will be no official requirement to devote more time to mathematics, coalition sources have stated that a comprehensive math exam in mathematics – along with a greater emphasis on this subject in the results rankings – will likely encourage schools to provide training.
The curriculum will focus more on “real-world problems”, including financial mathematics.
Ostrava Mayor Kajnar: Cancer in <0xC4><0x8C>SSD is not me
Before the elections, a long cigar dispute broke out between the two wings fighting for influence within the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD of Ostrava.
It all turned out that the mayor of Ostrava, Petr Kajnar, turned to the court for the undemocratic composition of the candidates.
The actors of the case, however, did not want to express themselves too much so as not to harm the party even further before the elections.
The votes of the voters are now counted.
The leadership of the Ostrava <0xC4><0x8C>SSD immediately called on the mayor of Ostrava on Monday evening to step out of the party, and he will probably also press for his loss of office.
Petr Kajnar wants to continue the fight.
What the dispute is about and who is on whose side, he described in an exclusive interview for the Diary.
How do you see the outcome of the election?
CSSD certainly expected a much better result.
Did it hurt us that the media dispute was resolved within the party before the elections?
I can imagine that social democracy could have a better election result.
But on the other hand, it corresponds to the state in which CSSD is now.
It’s the party that has its internal problems, it’s internally ill, and people feel that it’s not all right.
They made it clear in the election.
What are the internal diseases of CSSD?
I think the ODS has been going down for some time now, and unfortunately things like that are happening in social democracy.
It is so that lobbyists, influencing people who previously expected to find their prey at ODS, moved to and influenced people in the CSSD.
This is due to the fact that the police are walking through the offices of the Ostrava Magistrate and collecting computers.
This shows that <0xC4><0x8C>SSD is not just made up of people who want the good of everyone else, but many of them think primarily of their own good.
<0xC4><0x8C>SSD is divided into two irresistible camps in Prague, as can be seen in the current power struggle between Ha<0xC5><0xA1>kovci and Sobotkovci.
But this has been going on for a long time.
What happened before the elections in Ostrava was just a premonition of what is happening now in Prague.
Hashkov’s wing gradually took up positions to then trigger a situation that weakened Sobotkov’s wing after the election.
A person is in a situation in politics where sometimes he has to approach compromises.
But everyone has some internal limits where those compromises are no longer going to be made, and this is my case.
Initially I didn’t want to run for the House, but when I saw the whole thing inside the party, I agreed with Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> Zaorálk that I would try to get to the country candidate to strengthen the Sobotko wing as mayor of Ostrava.
The wing of the harness could have left a mark on it.
Why are you standing on the side of Bohuslav Sobotka, not Michael Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ka?
Slavek Sobotka is, in my opinion, a person who always talks primarily about the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD programme and to some extent also about visions for the side and for this country.
I admit, on the other hand, I haven't heard anything like that.
Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek is only fighting for power.
I do not understand how the Presidency, which is a lower body than the Central Executive Committee, can only begin to appeal to the party chairman.
This is a struggle for power regardless of everything and against the parties' statutes.
In my opinion, what Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek has now presented in Prague has ended his political career.
As you have noticed, the Ostrava leadership of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD has not approved you as a candidate.
Political parties are based on the competition, which of their members will be placed.
This competition should be largely based on programme visions and the ability of those people to fulfill those visions.
Of course, there are people who do not have a lot of skills or vision, but the political party is for them a lift to the money they would not get elsewhere.
The problem is, when these people start to get ahead by breaking the rules without scruples, they violate the party’s rules.
By their practices they make political parties of the mafia and, in my opinion, they also violate the laws of the Czech Republic.
To highlight this problem is more important to me than to consider whether any Kajnar has any political future.
It is important that the parties begin to respect the statutes.
So, before the elections, did you file a motion for a preliminary action against the CSSD candidate in the Moravian Slovak region?
The current district executive committee of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD in Ostrava strengthens its power by being able to abolish organizations that do not conform to it, purposefully establishing new organizations, gradually expelling uncomfortable party members.
An example is that they wanted to exclude Richard Bedna<0xC5><0x99>ík from the club, but he filed a lawsuit against it, and then they rather canceled the resolution on his exclusion.
This shows that to demand compliance with the party’s statutes through the courts is the last option, but at the moment when the other methods and control authorities within the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD have ceased to function, it is the only option.
The strength of the leadership of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD of Ostrava, headed by MEP Adam Rykala, is to resign you from the position of mayor.
It is a public secret that the mayor of Lumír Palyza has an envelope for this post.
It's like Adam Rykala and Lumír Palyza are trying to do everything they can to get me fired.
They promise people positions, they get votes, and then they consolidate their power in the side.
When I go back to the past, everything that might have happened around the football club Baník Ostrava and the purchase of the Bazaly stadium was just a pretense for them to attack me.
It was artificially censored so that I could be labeled as a person who gives money where it doesn’t belong.
The city has acquired a property that is strategically valuable to it.
So how do you see it with your stay in the office of mayor?
The District Committee has already called on me and other people on Monday to consider our stay in the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
But I think it's like the thief yelling, "Catch the thief!"
When we look at the results of my work over the past eleven years, I do not see anyone in the social democracy of Ostrava who would initiate and promote, sometimes even against members of the party, the emergence of so many developmental things, such as industrial zones or the expansion of science and technology.
Still, I'm getting uncomfortable.
I don’t read it other than preventing others from getting to the places they want.
Will you continue to fight these attempts in any way?
Because if this republic is to function well, then political parties must function well.
I can hardly believe that any party will be able to effectively govern the state if it cannot even manage itself.
So I don’t think I’m leaving the CSSD now, because I think the one who causes cancer on this side isn’t me, but these people who are trying to get me out.
Olomouc will open a public ski lift in the historic centre
The organizer of the Olomouc Christmas Markets and Winter Sliding Pavel Spälen<0xC3><0xBD> said that the preparation work on the skateboard was started on October 26 and that aggregates for ice production have been in operation since Wednesday.
The ice sheet is already seven centimeters strong and by Friday morning the area will be ready for the first visitors.
The slope has an area of 375 square meters, the stage took 358 square meters.
Brussels and the surroundings will also have two booths with slippers.
"We have expanded the floor area, expanded the space in front of the stands and almost the entire area of the podium is covered so that the skiers can comfortably overlap," Spalen<0xC3><0xBD> said.
The streets of Olomouc are reminiscent of Christmas.
Last year, the ski slope was installed in front of the main entrance of the town hall on the Upper Square due to the renovation of the Dolní Square.
Repair of the Lower Square was completed at the end of the summer, so the ice area could return to its original place.
For the first time, people were able to sneak right in front of the town hall in 2009, when the skateboard was in operation from January to March.
The ice area then became an integral part of the city’s Christmas markets.
The Christmas markets, part of which is a rich cultural program, will be launched on Upper Square a month before Christmas Day.
Pamela Anderson left to “squirt” the iconic blonde hairstyles and set up a new, dramatically brunette cut.
Pamela's blonde hair is famous for her role in the sexy TV show Coast Guard.
Pamela Anderson is the latest celebrity to shock her fans with a new hairstyle.
An ex-cat from the Coast Guard got rid of her long blonde hair and implanted a platinum shaving.
The 46-year-old actress revealed her last appearance change when she went to L.A. on Wednesday and posted a photo on her Twitter page.
This is the first time in 20 years that this blonde beauty has short hair, and we like this reluctant change.
What do you think of Pammy’s hair?

The brutal murder of a senior in Zlínsk will be judged again by the county court
The district court has dismissed the charges of the twenty-five-year-old Slovak and twenty-year-old Czech for lack of evidence.
The men refused the blame.
They are facing 15 to 20 years in prison or even an exceptional punishment.
Speaker Petr Angialossy confirmed that the Supreme Court annulled the county’s decision and returned the case to him again.
The judge refused to comment on the grounds that the decision had not yet been delivered to the parties.
According to the allegations, the young men attacked a seventy-seven-year-old man in his house.
The senior died of dreadful death.
According to the allegations, her men were cut, beaten and dug all over her body and also a metal object, apparently a gas pistol, and about three dozen wounds were inflicted on her head.
The man suffered serious injuries, such as fractures of the skull, swelling of the brain, or bleeding into the brain that he suffered on the spot.
The young men allegedly took some 3,000 crowns and jewelry worth about 14,000 crowns from the house.
According to the district court, they were the only, moreover, only indirect evidence against the defendant’s scent traces, which the expert considered not to be fully established in the sense of the legal instructions.
Smell traces from the scene of the crime and on other things were consistent with the defendants in more than a dozen cases, but police initially treated them as scented and not smeared.
In addition, there have been some errors in handling them.
According to the Senate, the guilt of the defendants was undoubtedly not proven.
However, the court acknowledged that the police had very difficult conditions.
A deceased elderly man with a broken head was found by relatives who thought he must have fallen and wounded himself.
None of the ambulance doctors were aware of the violent deaths.
After a few days, the criminals contacted the Olomouc doctors, who discovered signs of violent death during the incubation.
Police were no longer able to work with all traces of the crime scene cleaned up by relatives.
No DNA of the defendants was found on the scene.
The young Slovak lived in Hungary.
He is now serving an 8.5-year sentence, which was confirmed by the Olomouc Supreme Court last year.
According to him, the man was the head of an organized group of six young men who had a burglary of gold.
The robberies took place in October and November 2011, shortly after the murder of the senior man in Slopné.
The youngest of the accused in the murder of the senior is living in the Hungarian Highlands.
The court released him from prison in August after 11 months.
Znojmo starts with the reconstruction of the stadium
In early November, the reconstruction of the football stadium will begin in Znojme.
On Thursday, the stadium was taken over by the builders, who will carry out the reconstruction of the lawn.
The reconstruction of the city stadium in Znojme is divided into four stages in order to meet the standards for the first football league.
Live legend Wayne Shorter to close the harbor of the Autumn Strings Week
The saxophone giant and legend of the jazz scene Wayne Shorter will make the next Wednesday a point for the 18th Struna Autumn Festival.
Shorter will perform at the Lucerne Grand Hall on November 6 along with his quartet composed by Danilo Perez, John Patitucci and Brian Blade.
In the second half of the evening Shorter will be joined by spontaneous jazz improvisation PKF - Prague Philharmonia under the direction of Martin Kum<0xC5><0xBE>ák.
In Shorter's edits for the symphonic orchestra, Pegasus's new album Without A Net, as well as his older songs Lotus and Prometheus Unbound, will be included.
Although he celebrated his 80th birthday in August this year, Shorter is still full of strength, which proves that the Prague concert at Struens in the fall is starting his world tour.
Wayne Shorter entered the world of music more than sixty years ago.
The list of performers he collaborated with ranges from Miles Davis to Herbie Hancock, Joni Mitchell to Carlos Santana.
During his musical journey, he also met Czech musician Miroslav Vitous and Viennese relative Joe Zawinul, with whom in the legendary Weather Report for more than a decade he indicated the direction of a new style of fusion.
He has been performing for the past 13 years with the Wayne Shorter Quartet.
Someday after the festival, there will be another club night Spotlight, which will take place on November 9 at the Roxy/NoD club.
In addition to the charismatic singer Andrey Triany, the Manchester trio Go Go Penguin will be introduced to the local audience with its jazz-influenced electronics and young jazz talent Ian Mikyska, which will bring the electro-jazz formation of Deep Bass inspired by dance styles.
The women's team has banned UEFA from publishing penalties for referees.
Dagmar Damková, chairman of the Board of Arbitrators of the Czech Football Association, has stopped publishing sentences for the courts.
It is banned by UEFA rules, which she said in an interview with the Law Journal.
Otherwise, it would be a threat to the police.
Damková also denied that in her role, she would give the footballers Plzna where she came from.
These speculations are really nonsense.
It is true that I live in Pilsen, but the other members of the Commission have left, for example, Prague.
So in the case of a vote, I can lose 1:6," Damková said in response to a criticism that broke out after Pilsen played twice as much penalty lately as other league teams.
So although in recent months the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R has stopped publishing sentences for the arbitrators, Damková assures that the courts are complaining about their mistakes.
"Believe me, if the commission finds that the referee has made a mistake, it will limit his delegation, no matter what the match was," Damkova said.
The reason why the penalties are not published is, according to the Damsk ban from the European Football Union.
"UEFA prohibits the disclosure of such information and the violation of severe penalties."
"We're very suspicious and we're looking for something behind every mistake."
“We published the restrictions, but I received two very strong warnings that if we don’t stop, there will be tough sanctions,” Damková said.
The rest of the world respects the ban.
"We were really an exception," she added.
If the information continued to be released, the commission could lose money from UEFA for the education and development of arbitrators.
"And they're very important to us."
"Without them, we would not be able to complete the arbitration training program," Damková added.
Barty's detention is related to Janu<0xC5><0xA1>k and Béma: Is it worth the leak?
The President of Public Affairs Víto Bartu was arrested by police on Thursday.
Together with him, Jan Petr<0xC5><0xBE>ílek, head of the Department of Analytics and Informatics of Anti-Corruption Police, was arrested.
The detention is related to the interviews of lobbyist Roman Janou<0xC5><0xA1>k and former mayor Pavel Bém (ODS).
The information about the senders, with which the server Novinky.cz came, was confirmed by the Czech Press Office as a reliable source.
Janu<0xC5><0xA1>ka and Bém’s telephone calls, published in March by the journal Mladá fronta Today, in which the two men address each other “Mazánka” and “Kolib<0xC5><0x99>ík”, show Janu<0xC5><0xA1>k’s influence on the steps of the city under the leadership of Bém.
The newspaper then said that it was acquired by the Security Information Service (BIS) in 2007, of which two years later they fled to the security agency ABL.
That was where Bart owned it.
Server News.cz warned that the detained criminal Petr<0xC5><0xBE>ílek was working for the BIS just before he joined the anti-corruption police.
To the anti-corruption service, which subsequently handled interrogations, Petr<0xC5><0xBE>ílek passed at the same time as they were published.
"With regard to the law on the protection of classified information, I cannot confirm or say anything at all," said Prosecutor Michal Muravsk<0xC3><0xBD> from the City Public Prosecutor's Office in Prague.
He also refused to confirm that he was overseeing the case.
He does not want to comment on the case for the same reason.
Six out of ten companies are preparing for new civil code
Six out of ten companies are intensively preparing for the coming effect of the new Civil Code and the Commercial Corporations Act from 1 January 2014.
Only 8% of respondents said that the issues related to the two key codes in their company had not been resolved at all.
This is the result of a survey by Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal, which surveyed the opinions of 108 Czech companies.
With the imminent expiry of both key codes, it is only now at the last minute that a number of managers are beginning to realize what a significant impact they can have on their businesses.
In our view, the biggest changes in private law in the last 50 years will affect all citizens and companies in the Czech Republic.
Due to the labyrinth of politicians, the business sector has long lived in uncertainty whether or not revolutionary changes will eventually occur.
“But now they have only a few weeks left to make the transition to the new law for their companies without complications,” said Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal partner Jan Spati<0xC4><0x8D>il.
Of the 61 percent of companies intensively engaged in new legislation, 26 percent said their companies had already taken all the necessary measures to be prepared in time.
Furthermore, 35 percent of these companies are planning to take the necessary measures in the near future.
However, one in five companies has not yet been involved in recodes, yet they have a concrete idea of how to prepare for them.
In total, 11 percent have no opinion and cannot judge the issue.
Only 8% of companies admit that the issues related to recodes have not yet been resolved.
The most important legal topic related to the new Civil Code is the conclusion of new contracts for the largest number of companies surveyed (21 per cent), followed by the solution of business conditions (16 per cent) and further changes in the property registry and liability for damages (after ten per cent).
In the case of contracts, one of the most important innovations of the whole re-codification takes place, namely the consolidation of the revision of contracts only within the framework of the new Civil Code.
The current parallel regulation in the Civil and Commercial Code will disappear, as a result of which contract law should become more transparent for citizens and businessmen.
“In the case of entrepreneurs, the new modification will offer many innovations with an emphasis on greater freedom of organization of relationships,” said Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal lawyer Lukas Poddan<0xC3><0xBD>.
In the context of the Business Corporations Act, almost a quarter of companies consider the issue of increasing the responsibilities of statutory bodies to be the most important topic.
Subsequently, the topics related to changes in the vocation and course of the general assembly (15 percent) and the representation of the company (14 percent).
The new legislation means tightening obligations and potential impacts for statutory authorities, especially in situations where a company is at risk of falling into a bankruptcy.
"In practice, this means that if the board members and the company's managers do not act with the care of the proper manager and do not revert the threatening decline of the company, they may lose the benefits they have gained from the performance of the function until the last two years," he added.
Pierre Rainero: I'm trying to make Cartier's style evolve as a living language
It is my job to preserve tradition and at the same time to lead our brand to modern things so that it does not remain a dusty relic, explains in an interview with HN Pierre Rainero, Director of Style at Cartier.
This French luxury house was founded in 1847.
It travels through mud, river and jungle and provides free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in villages in Cameroon.
Bwelle and his team treat hundreds of patients almost every weekend
There are not too many doctors in West Africa; only one in 5,000 people.
Vote here or via your mobile phone. Vote here.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 nominees for the 2013 CNN Heroes Award.
In the 2013 CNN Heroes Awards Competition, you can vote for him or any of the top ten candidates.
The winner will receive <0x24>250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwell watched his father fall unconscious over and over again and drive to hospitals that weren’t equipped to help him.
In 1981, Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near the capital of Cameroon, Yaoundé.
At first he was treated only with a broken hand, but then he developed an infection that spread to the brain, and there hematoma created, which caused him problems his whole life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” says Georges Bwelle.
We'd have to take him out of Cameroon if we had the money to do it.
Instead, Bwelle spent years transporting his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals, where he received treatment that was simply available.
"It's not easy," says Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five in the morning, rush to the hospital to be there first, but you are not the first.
There's a lot of patients out there.
Some people just die because they have to wait.
Since Bwelle’s father died in 2002, the situation hasn’t changed much.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor per 5,000 people in Cameroon.
For comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 inhabitants.
And even if the Cameroon doctors could visit, many would not have been able to afford it.
Two out of five people in this country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of healthcare spending in this country is private.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” says Bwelle.
Because of poverty, they can’t enjoy life.
When Bwelle saw his father and many of his compatriots suffer, he decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed 700 free surgeries last year.
He himself became a vascular surgeon at the central hospital in Yaoundé.
And he founded the non-profit organization ASCOVIME, whose members visit rural areas on the weekend, where they provide free medical care.
Since 2008, his group of volunteers has helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people rush into the trucks, attach to the roofs of medical supplies, and travel through rough terrain to villages in need of help.
It is not always accompanied by happiness.
Once upon a time, vehicles must push through the river and mud.
But when they arrive, they are greeted as real heroes: hospice, singing and dancing and the best accommodation that the community can offer.
In these villages, free medical care is a real reason to celebrate, and Bwelle – with her wide smile and unwavering energy – is very willing to engage in the local joy.
The next day, the team starts treating hundreds of patients.
“We have 500 patients on every trip,” says Bwelle.
They come to the village from a 60-kilometre district, on foot.
During each of these weekends, doctors provide a variety of health care.
Many are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasitic diseases and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may get berles or gifted glasses or birth certificates for free – a document that the school requires, but that many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team performs a simple operation under local narcotics.
Surgery is usually done in the school building, in the town hall, or at home; after the operation, the patient gets up and goes to the recovery site to release the place to another patient.
With the help of the light from the generator, the operating room and the hygiene equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers work early in the morning.
It’s exhausting, but village musicians usually help the team not to lose motivation.
“To stay up and keep working, they play drums all night,” says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team will head back to the city, tired but proud of their work.
This group – consisting of Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students – carried out 700 free surgeries last year and realizes that their help can mean a lot to locals.
One man said he would be able to work again after surgery.
“This will change the future of our family,” said the man.
In addition to organizing these weekend clinics and working as a surgeon at Bwelle Hospital, he also works at night for private health clinics around the city of Yaoundé.
It says that it is this second job that finances about 60% of its non-profit activities; the rest covers private contributions.
“I’m not sure when she actually sleeps,” says Katie O’Malley, who studied medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia for the second year and is working as a volunteer for the Bwelle group.
He’s either in the hospital, or he’s trying to earn money for the organization so he can do these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley who came from the United States or Europe to join Bwelle's mission, it's a great practice they wouldn't get at home.
“Dr. Bwelle’s hands were thoroughly washed and bloody stains removed, or we held his instruments,” says O’Malley.
You will never experience this as a second-year medical student in America.
Volunteers usually pay for their trip to Cameroon on their own and often come with donated medical needs.
But as soon as they arrive in Yaoundé, Bwelle provides them with food, transportation and study.
“Surely he’s a hero,” says O’Malley.
This organization gives its life and its desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwelle, constant constipation is not a burden.
Helping others to live happily, fulfilling the promise he made to his father is something that brings him great joy.
“I’m so happy to do this job,” says Bwelle.
And I'm thinking of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Laughing at people, easing their pain – that’s why I do it.

Minister Holcát restored the role of Head Sister for the Czech Republic
The main nurse for the Czech Republic should represent the interests of nurses, whose number in the Czech Republic exceeds 100,000.
"I consider it essential that these functions be clearly defined and formalized so that the nurses of their representative have within the structure of the office - a representative that they can always turn to if needed," said Martin Holcát, Minister of Health.
I appreciate the work of the nurses, and I think that the nursing profession deserves proper attention from the Ministry.
In the performance of this profession, you need not only high professionalism, but also human approach and personal conviction.
"I will be happy and with all responsibility to endeavor to take steps that can improve the position of nurses."
"We have excellent and skilled nurses in our health care, but I would also like to appeal to those colleagues who are not helping us too much by their approach to patients, to carry out their calls with all empathy and to help us improve the image of the nurses in the eyes of the public," she says.
The newly appointed Head Sister for the Czech Republic Alena <0xC5><0xA0>mídová also stated that she wants to deal with various aspects of the position of the nurse and intends to cooperate with professional associations, non-professionals and other companies.
"I don't really want to separate the professions of doctors and nurses, but instead I see them standing next to me, each with their own competences and together with other healthcare professionals they form a well-rounded team that provides health services for the benefit of the patient."
“I myself face a number of problems that occur when performing a nurse’s profession, which I can’t easily perceive and intend to participate in their solutions.”
These include, for example, ensuring the simplification of nursing and health documentation.
“From my own experience, I know that some administrative tasks burden nurses unnecessarily and take them time that they could and should prefer to devote to patients,” says Alena <0xC5><0xA0>mídová.
Other areas that it intends to focus on include improving working conditions, finding ways to improve cooperation in the team and with the management of health service providers, adapting competences, as well as working legal issues, such as non-compliance with the work schedule and time constraints.
We often hear anonymous stitches, but fears of a possible impact are not documented in a specific case where a violation of the rules could occur.
"Where there is no prosecutor, there is no judge, and so the role of Head Sister of the Czech Republic could in this case serve as a guarantee of the preservation of the anonymity of such a complaint and a specific case to be investigated by the competent authorities," concludes Alena <0xC5><0xA0>mídová.
Mgr. Alena <0xC5><0xA0>mídová graduated from the Secondary School of Health in the field of Nursing (graduated in 1978) and the Faculty of Philosophy of the University of Karlovy V in Prague in the Nursing - Pedagogy degree program (graduated in 1992).
Since 2010 he has been the head of the Department of Nursing and other non-medical fields and the recognition of qualifications in the Department of Education and Science of the MZ<0xC4><0x8C>R.
During her professional career she worked as a nurse at the bed in the internal department, and also as a teacher at the Secondary School of Health, where she also served as a statutory deputy director for 8 years.
From 2004 to 2009 she served as the Chief Nurse of the Czech Prison Service.
She published several professional textbooks of nursing and articles in professional journals, devoted herself to lectures in the field of nursing.
He is not a member of any political party.
So that I don't give up hatred
The writer Václav Kahuda returned to writing after 12 years.
After many years of reading, living, but not writing, V<0xC3><0x81>CLAV KAHUDA (1965) publishes a new novel Wind, Darkness, Presence.
That this is not a narrow volume, the number of pages is predicted to be comparable to his most famous work of Hou<0xC5><0xA1>tina (Petrov, 2001).
Another prominent Czech writer of the present time - Emil Hakl, for Salon Kahudu.
What moved you to write a novel after 12 years of silence?
I did it... so that I wouldn't be inclined to hate.
To see constantly new and new clones of human stupidity, young organisms affected by blind egotistical efforts.
I’m not even talking about the elderly, the faces ruined by impotent greed, the exchange of souls, and vice versa by ideologists who are trying to sell their “product” with the expression of a little selling whore.
At the beginning of the millennium, I bought a small digital camera and filmed my juridical friends, strangers and hidden systems.
It's over for me.
Sometimes I feel like my brain burns out of life on this planet.
I prefer to go for a walk and then read a book in the evening.
You're talking about a sense of hatred, a sense of hatred.
Was there any evil in the past that affected you, or are you just getting old, like all of us?
The fracture occurred a long time ago, about ten years ago.
It had no name at the time.
Well, I lived after that.
There's still a quiet boy in there, but he's still surprised.
I see other lone bugs, everyone in my tornado of anxiety.
I was saved by writing books.
I will participate in this huge, thousands of years-long movement of the system of life on this planet - the birth of an incomprehensible future.
The immense, breathtaking complexities of life, where every stone is the direct heir to our presence.
We are players of sad and beautiful games, where the path of trial-by-default creates next and next generations of beings, which in trillions of interactions per second create some superhuman, artificial intelligence.
Twelve years is a relatively long time.
Do you see your writing as a continuous process, or did you start from scratch?
Self-talk, or rather dialogue, which leads the right and left half of the brain, sometimes flows to the level and forms in the book.
As the periods of peace are interspersed with silent metastases of wars that may one day awaken – so my book is twelve years of silence dressed in words.
I felt the avalanche of life growing in my brain, and if I don't do anything, it'll silence me one day.
It is a set of questions formulated by the brain and puts them into layers that are stored in the dark "under the level of consciousness".
The Neocortex, a gray cortex of the brain, asks for older evolutionary formations, goes to the ancient leotards of the brain tree.
He talks to the furry shells, asks the snakes, seeks an answer in the flight of birds, raises his eyes to the clouds in the sky.
Yes, the moral law in me and the starry sky above me.
At the end of the day, the brain asks the world.
Relatively often you express the ego metaphorically - could you define it biologically?
The brain stores in its billions of compounds and electrochemical bonds all the memories, experiences and experiences that a person has experienced.
This forest, logically and emotionally exposed and branched with trees of information, memory records, uses the brain in its recognition, cognitive, process, is exposed to constantly changing presences, in an unrelenting attempt to nominate and understand its eyes.
Sometimes there are disorders of overload.
Similarly - as if you were "falling" the PC, from a speech emulator program and translator from foreign languages you would get involved first in an operating environment, for example Windows, and after a few unsuccessful restarts ended up with a dark-green-looking processor, and a composure on a screen, which is a bios based system.
For those who have not yet understood what this is all about, I am talking about a psycho-spiritual crisis.
You mention it often – why do you regularly get interested in this type of regression?
Because it's a cave.
In the succession of the functional mechanisms of our thinking, feeling and behavior - there will be a breakthrough.
Here it is good to find Nietzsche: "So long he looked at the ruin, when the ruin looked at him."
Rigid feeling - that a person is lost, if all hope disappears, mentally "dead" and a new quality emerges.
And why do I care about it personally?
I'll answer by illustration.
Once one fell into the shadow and melted, days, months and years went by, he kept melting and reading, and the books taught him how to swim - that is, to live.
He became a "diver."
I hope that some of the poems written by me will help someone, as the texts of the Count once helped me.
To what extent do you mean by a reader, a specific person who will read your text?
The one of which nothing meaningful can be said, some call it consciousness, another super ego, but I think it best characterised Arthur Rimbaud in a letter to a friend:
"I am someone else - this reader is directly involved in the process of formulating words and phrases."
From an early age, he read books of old Czech fairy tales, floated in the submarine of Captain Nema, ran through Stínadle in dark streets.
In the end, behind all this branching of the authors and their message, it reads: "The sun shines to the worlds of other Karl Hynk Máchá".
What if the book is out?
Do you care about the reader’s opinion?
On the reflection that comes to you through the people who read the book?
Of course, I care about the opinion of people who take three hundred crowns and are willing to read five hundred pages of text.
And even then, for years, they accidentally contact me on the street and thank me for helping them with my book in some of their difficult life decisions.
Books are actually "life" or better said "worlds".
They are encoded into characters of letters, they carry experience, the history of the regions of which language.
We can awaken them to life whenever we let their sentences flow into the brain.
It is actually, in a way, something forbidden of the divine - to awaken further and further life stories, small universes and temporary planets.
It's a fact whose DNA is stored in spells - according to old demonic books, we're going to commit to witchcraft.
After the publication of the book, you are - as it happens - waiting for a chain of author readings.
I remember that you once liked reading.
Are you going to be happy again, or do you feel it differently over the years?
I'd rather tell you that today.
And what did I find out?
There are smart people everywhere.
Their basic characteristic - they're unremarkable, they don't pay too much attention to each other, they have friendly rays, you don't feel lonely with them.
Let me give an example - in the town of <0xC4><0x8C>erven<0xC3><0xBD> Kostelec there was (and I hope he is still alive) a handsome bookmaker (appropriately named <0xC4><0x8C>ervenka), a cheerful companion and a good girl bull.
During one pajamas, he introduced me to individual articles of a chain of readers of my book Hou<0xC5><0xA1>tina.
I looked into their eyes, and then a fragmented, read copy of my book was shown to me.
In despair, I laid off the just-sharp morning and cried briefly in a man’s voice.
We were all standing there, sighing, and crying with a sense of urgency.
Then the young blonde mixer couldn't stand it and jumped over his head from the window into the snow curtain with a spike.
It was on the ground floor.
We ran into the nightland and ate with the happy rage of the sensationalists, the painful soul of the landscapers, and a bunch of fallen patriots – they went out and lifted up like wolves until morning.
Each of your books is formally and materially different from the previous ones.
Is the same with the text Wind, Darkness, Presence?
It's a story.
It is a story of one country behind nine rivers and nine mountains.
Ivan Bunin in his novel Suchodol puts in the mouth of the folk healer the words of an old Russian fairy tale: On the sea, on the ocean, on the island of Bujana.
There's a dog lying on it, a grey bottle.
Horror, horror, secret.
It never happened, but we all know it from somewhere.
We may have been devils in hell long ago and we've been lazy - what role we'll play on this earth.
Are you going to continue writing, or are you going to leave it on the free flow of inspiration again?
The answers are eternal - Otokar B<0xC5><0x99>ezina.
Writing is a wonderful way of dialogue.
Something enormous and unnamed, similar to the movement of the continents on the planet, affects our desires from such a depth and in such a wide range that it completely transcends our horizon – and so, with absolute certainty, we are doing precisely in the intentions of our programmed task.
We're rewarded with an influx of dopamine, a mixture of endorphins and other substances.
We are biological machines.
We want to mate, we die in defense and acquire new personal territories.
Sometimes there is a disruption and we have compassion.
It is only then that we have the right to call people.
That's the answer to your question - a biological robot is already full of various disorders, standing on the shores of the ocean of unconsciousness and into a hole-in-the-seat made of dirty pockets captures the influx of wet wind.
I have to write in order to be human.
Obama Resigns from Health Care
After a wave of criticism, President Obama resigned from his often repeated and ambitious promise that “if you like your health program, you can keep it.”
With the appeals of hundreds of thousands of announcements of statements made by providers, Republicans in recent days have accused the president of deceiving the American public.
Yesterday, Obama slipped away from his original promise.
“The vast majority of people who have working health insurance can keep it,” he said in his Boston speech.
In view of what he called a “mirror in the media” of the statements, Obama called on Americans who received these notifications to look for new insurance in the market.
Most people will be able to have a better, more comprehensive healthcare program for the same price or even cheaper than expected.
“You’ll get a better offer,” he said.
His administration claims it should not be a surprise that 5 percent of the population who bought insurance for themselves may be forced to change the program because their insurance does not meet the new requirements given by the Available Care Act.
“I’m telling these Americans at the same level: you deserve something better,” Sebelius said in a statement to the Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Availability Care Act, said the launch of the internet market had been "offering" since October.
“I’m disappointed and angry like everyone else,” she said.
I'll try to get your trust back.
Annoyed Sebelius said the phrase, which he caught on the microphone, yesterday to the advisor behind her at the Committee's meeting yesterday after a stormy exchange of views with Republican Billy Long, Missouri's representative, who had to deal with the program alone.
For more than three hours during the Sebelius hearing, he repeatedly questioned why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily give up government-sponsored insurance, and did not buy a program through HealthCare.gov, which now invades millions of Americans.
Which billionaire will you call next year?
Kellner, owner of the PPF group, wants to buy operator O2.
Both companies have confirmed the talks and according to various sources from the agencies and from behind the scenes, it is said that the hand is already in the sleeve.
The transaction announcement is expected to expire in November, probably before the start of the frequency auction for LTE networks, i.e. before November 11.
Kellner's competitor Karel Komárek owns the KKCG group.
The Telecommunications Rate was auctioned for LTE network frequencies.
And to the general surprise, by that time, the company’s taste of penetrating telecommunications was not talked about.
But Sazku is now led by very experienced telecommunications mask Robert Chvátal.
He started as the marketing manager of Radiomobil (now T-Mobile), later became the director of Slovak T-Mobil and last time he was head of the Austrian branch of the same operator.
The rate plays several cards at once.
She signed up for the auction and now admitted that she wanted to launch a virtual at Vodafone.
And it makes sense.
If the auction succeeds, you will be able to move existing customers from your own virtual operator to your network.
Vodafone would probably not like this under normal circumstances, but according to the Economic Newspapers, it could be part of a much closer cooperation between the two companies.
Vodafone is currently suffering from the agreement of competing operators O2 and T-Mobile, who will completely share their networks.
Vodafone needs a partner.
And that could be the rate.
If it succeeds in the tender on the LTE network (as a newbie can auction a specially designed spectrum), then Vodafone does not have to go to auction at all, or it will not bother to auction only a limited spectrum (there is not enough frequency for everyone).
Vodafone can be shared with the Rate over the network.
Vodafone will launch Sazku into its 2G/3G network (the newly built LTE network at 900 MHz respectively), allowing the company to quickly start the network.
In the meantime, the company will start building a costly LTE network, which Vodafone will also be able to use.
Both companies can be satisfied.
The savings could then be spent by Vodafone on some fixed internet or cable TV provider.
And the waiter?
The buyer of Czech and Slovak O2 (Slovak branch is a Czech subsidiary) would immediately acquire a full-fledged operator with still decent profits and a wide range of services.
But on the other hand, it is a large mold that will be waiting for restructuring.
In the auction LTE, Kellner would already win for O2 and most likely in synergy with T-Mobile.
The two companies have already announced that they will share their networks.
The auction could eventually end up being a success, but probably not enough with the high amounts that the state budget is looking forward to.
And from next year, customers in the Czech Republic could choose between a call with Vodafone, T-Mobile, Kellner or Komárk.
Or two titans of the Czech business against the global giants.
Will Czech TV ever be able to do without signing events?
In the era of President Zeman entered the legendary scene with the ash, so it is not difficult to listen to the complaints that collect documents of the castle family’s persecution.
In the past, the traditional influence of such Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Tvlí<0xC4><0x8D>ík has not been documented in this way, but to sign under it.
True, the editors stopped.
The cases described, however, do not give an answer to the question of where some journalists’ tendency toward the people of the land comes from – whether it is a response to a direct order, or not to use vulgarism, a typical expression of non-local empathy.
And when we assume general perplexity, we cannot forgive the question of whether there are no other, not less scrupulous, power interests that have not yet been given the opportunity to change the proportions of television.
The truth is, those who say that in developed countries there are no occult attempts to interfere with politicians to broadcast.
The truth, however, is also that this does not mean that there would be no complaints to the public media.
Complainants do not question their independence.
On the contrary, they criticize mainly what they consider to be the tendency that is theirs, which is the fruit of their subculture.
Maybe we just haven’t reached this stage of civilization yet and this situation isn’t with us.
But perhaps in a country that thinks it is the most corrupt in the world, black and white stories about bad politicians and good journalists are more comfortable than more complicated descriptions of the opaque situation in which the behavior of many imperfect people is affected.
JAN JANDOUREK: Curses of this country: Presidents on the brink of power
It is almost the rule that in the key moments of the country, the head of state was not in such a form as to be able to fulfill its state duties.
If T. Masaryk were physically and mentally five years younger, he would have experienced the end of his presidency and the events around Munich would have taken place a little differently.
We probably wouldn’t win the war, but after symbolic resistance, the aviation could fly beyond the borders, heavy weapons could be destroyed, and the government could flee to London right away and not worry about its legitimacy there.
And most importantly, the nation would not have a coconut from that capitulation until today.
Bene<0xC5><0xA1> was not a statesman and was still in good condition for Munich, but in the war he started to walk with him from the hill and in February 48 he behaved accordingly.
To be a little better, he could go into exile for the third time and undermine the legitimacy of the Communists and their coup.
It's a shame to talk about Hayes.
He was voted out by saying, “Mr. President will not get into the situation that he will decide.”
But he had to, even though the big decision with a knife on his neck at Hitler's office probably wasn't.
In the last days of March 1939, Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Moravec, head of intelligence, told the Germans what to do to ensure that the occupation he knew about the day did not take place so smoothly and with such profit.
The senil president and the cowardly government did nothing, but they did not believe him, but they were afraid.
Godwald's human concern had his flight attendants executed, as Moscow had commanded him.
Ludvik Svoboda was definitely disqualified from taking part in normalization and had to sit down, already completely senile.
The fact that Husák was powerless and sickly depressed old man made it easier in November 89, but that is the only stockpile.
Havel was fortunate to have not met him in the office in recent years, he was spared the worst.
Klaus is still a fresh retired tennis player, but many of his practices suggest that thought processes are no longer what they used to be.
Well, now we have this.
The head of state and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces looks what it looks like, and we don't know everything yet.
Fortunately, there is no external threat to the Republic.
Or maybe it's threatening, but it's not that obvious.
Then the question is whether it is exceptionally (historically) good that the president is not fully in power.
It is not a normal condition.
Wouldn’t we be able to choose in this country as president once again someone who is acceptablely thinking and who is acceptablely healthy?
Remote planets, black-and-white movies, or a little bit of fantasy about alien life on Earth are not topics that American jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter would overlook.
In the concept of his quartet, which on November 6 in the large hall of Lucerna in Prague will finish this year’s Struna Autumn Festival, that is, everything relates to everything.
The score of the quartet of jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter is the momentary feelings of the musicians.
According to his assignment, two younger generations of colleagues have to play what they are currently experiencing.
They approach music as completely improvised chamber matters and think not of harmony or rhythm, but in film images.
This principle, however, is a freshly eighty-year-old Shorter - an extraordinary composer, nine Grammys holder, former co-star Miles Davis and perhaps the greatest living jazz saxophonist today - does not like to explain.
He doesn’t talk too much about music, although his overall view of life is closely related to music.
At the age of 80, I came to the conclusion that it is best to let life surprise me.
“Too many people plan everything, and then they’re disappointed when things happen differently,” Shorter says.
How Insects from Thailand Raised Paris Bar Sales
Maybe you’re sliding over an insect and you don’t realize that you’re dreaming about half a kilo a year completely voluntarily.
For example, thrown in the meat.
If you consume it consciously, then you are clearly trendy: it’s organic, nutritious and you’ve also taken care of for a unique experience.
In early October, Elie Daviron, the chef and bar owner of Le Festin Nu, was the first in Paris to list the offer of insects on his business menu.
The bar, for which the book was inspired by William Burroughs's Naked Lunch, you would find a lot of tourists in the fashionable 18th district near Montmartre.
With fresh avocados, baked red peppers, ginger and turkey eggs, guests can taste not only different larvae, chickpeas or watermelons, but also steaks.
Carefully and specially packed deliveries (to prevent insects from damaging their wings, twisting their legs or damaging their eyes) are sent to Daviron from Thailand.
Europe is only learning to eat insects, it is common elsewhere.
The owner of the Paris bar with a pioneering menu immediately outlines several reasons why to consume insects.
The first is the ecological benefit, because insect production is much less expensive for our planet (in terms of finance, space and water consumption) than traditional meat.
“In addition, insects are an excellent source of protein and omega 3 fatty acids,” Daviron told Reuters.
At the same time, a young cook does not deny his profession, he simply aims to offer his customers a unique culinary experience.
According to him, it makes the right restaurant the pleasure, the feeling of sin and the atmosphere of the environment.
"I'm not saving the world, I'm just mediating a new experience," he explained.
By far not everyone would probably be impressed by the idea of consuming broccoli decorated with pesto, but the reactions of the customers of the Paris bar to served insects are very positive, according to the owner.
Even skeptics say they finally taste, even if they start with the smallest sauces and eventually choose scorpions.
The prices of these tasting plates range from five to nine euros.
The President of the Association of Entrepreneurs in Construction in the Czech Republic Václav Matya<0xC5><0xA1>: New green savings should continue
Since 2008, Czech construction industry has been facing a continuous decline in the volume of contracts and a lack of the state to address the problem of investment construction.
The announcement of the New Green Savings Programme was a positive signal for our construction sector, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises in different regions.
It is a great opportunity not only for citizens who will save significant amounts for heating after the implementation of the measure, but also opportunities for construction companies and construction materials manufacturers.
Each billion invested will bring more than 2,700 newly created jobs to the state.
In terms of state fiscal policy, significant leverage and multiplication effects are also one of the most significant growth measures.
Therefore, the Association of Entrepreneurs in Construction in the Czech Republic essentially disagrees with the Government’s resolution and calls for the implementation of such measures as to allow further continuation of the programme so that further challenges can be announced within the framework of it.
RIGHTS, 1 November 2013
The dog cuts the carpet, the president stabs and ends up in Berlin.
President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman left the motorcycle hospital in Prague on Thursday, where he spent the night in bed, and went to the castle in Lane.
What health condition is he in?
In an unprecedented confession, John Kerry said that American espionage "has gone too far"
John Kerry pointed to a softening of the U.S. defensive stance on his surveillance programs and said in an unprecedented confession that in some cases espionage "has gone too far".
The foreign minister also admitted that he, along with Barack Obama, was responsible for acting as an “autopilot” in view of the stiff disclosure of the NSA’s spying activity, which emerged thanks to informant Edward Snowden.
Released information sparked a diplomatic storm between the U.S. government and its allies.
Mr Kerry, through a video link at an open government conference in London, said: “There is no doubt that the President and I and the rest of the government have actually learned about some things that have been going on since the period of permanence, because there was an opportunity of 11 wars, of wars, of wars, of wars, and of wars, with reference to another war.
He became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage had crossed the border, but stressed that it was not violated the rights of the destroyer.
He said, "In some cases, it's gone too far."
And the president is determined to try to explain it to the people and he is already conducting a thorough review so that no one feels that there has been abuse.
I assure you that there is no abuse of the rights of innocent persons in this process.
However, Kerry insisted that the NSA is pursuing good and that its tracking operations have saved many lives.
He added: “We are struggling with a new world in which people are willing to ignite themselves.”
There is radical extremism in the world that is determined to kill and throw people into the air and attack governments.
What if you were able to catch it and stop it before it happens?
In fact, we have prevented planes from crashing, buildings from exploding, and people from being executed, because we are already able to learn about these plans in advance.
The chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday that U.S. lawmakers are preparing to go to Europe to respond to concerns from abroad regarding alleged U.S. espionage, and convinced Europeans that they need to continue fighting for their country.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and other people this week and that he was concerned about their threat to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations because they were disappointed by the National Security Agency (NSA) monitoring.
For the national security interests of the United States, it is really important that Europe stays on the same ship with us, given the joint efforts to fight terrorism, said Murphy, a member of the Democratic Party and chairman of the Senate’s Foreign Affairs Committee.
And I am heading to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger over the NSA programs.
News in the media that the NSA has collected millions of phone records in Europe has disrupted ties with some US allies, although the agency’s head this week said they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of the metadata that NATO allies have collected, shared and shared with the states.
A further revelation cited documents revealed by Snowden that the NSA tracked the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and 34 other world leaders.
National Intelligence Director James Clapper defended the allies' espionage as necessary and said it was a common matter on both sides.
Amid the screams, Murphy said his office was planning a parliamentary tour that should take place this year, and hoped members of both sides and chambers would appear in the delegation.
In the coming days, the names of the other legislators who are planning to participate will be published.
He said he's still working on the program.
Although Murphy said the goal of the trip was to help improve relationships, he added that "well-meaning educational measures will be prepared."
He said European leaders must be honest with their own people when it comes to spying programs that they have been using for years.
"While we are regulating our monitoring programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also be aware that we are not the only ones who carry out espionage here," Murphy said.
In the meantime, Mr Kerry is heading as planned this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to respond to the indifference already sparked by US strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as American surveillance.
Australian woman appealed against stay in Thai prison
A twenty-one-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to 15 days in prison on the island of Phuket when she falsely claimed to have been attacked by a taxi driver, appealed against the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was originally charged on June 15 by a land court on Phuket Island with a false charge when she was attacked by a taxi driver along with two other men who allegedly detained her on Sunday morning.
However, an industrial television record later revealed that after breaking up with her Australian friend, she returned safely to her hotel.
Police on Phuket Island interviewed Bamford two days before she found out she had invented the incident.
She was detained in a local police cell before the trial.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in prison at a low-security periphery facility in Phuket, instead of being placed in adult women’s prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who, in the case of his daughter, asked for help from the Canberra State Department.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph that the whole family had "extreme concerns" about her daughter's fate and wanted her back to Australia.
“Obviously, it’s a tough time, but we hope he’ll be back safely as soon as possible,” Tunks said.
Bamford appealed against the judgment and was released on bail of 50,000 baht.
Australia reports that she has spent her holidays in the Krabi resort area in southern Thailand.
Law sources in Thailand say Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but she was warned that the appeal could lead to a trial that would increase her sentence and put her in adult prison.
However, following the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also try to repair a disgraced picture for tourists, which may well have been behind the liberating verdict.
He jokingly said, “Breaking ice.”
He got a puck in the defending band and no one caught him anymore.
In addition, the escape changed after a quick forhend call.
Jaromír Jágr scored against Tampa on Wednesday night, and on Thursday night the 119th NHL goal was commented on Facebook.
“After watching this video, the director of <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> drah called to my agent Petra Svobodvi and asked him if I was interested in advertising their most modern train Pendolino!” wrote Jagr.
They say we're kind of like each other.
I guess I'm gonna have to finish my night training so I don't rush any further.
"I'm afraid he could call the Minister of Defence then and he'd like to do a pusher advertisement!" he added.
In addition, New Jersey won the second in a row.
"And most importantly, you have noticed - the treatment of Maria Rottro takes," Yagr concluded.
Place of elective candle elective gula<0xC5><0xA1>
The October elections, rather than the winners, brought a bunch of losers.
It is not only the parties that have not entered the House of Representatives (e.g. SPOZ), but also the previous government parties (ODS, TOP 09) and finally the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD because of their internal division.
Politicians served us a goulach on the weekend instead of a candlestick.
The sprint of the election was the Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> movement, which promised voters to change the political style of governance to date.
The fragmentation of the election result and the split in the winning party records the political (s) for President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman regardless of the wishes of the voters who have not even elected the party that President Zeman publicly supported to the House of Representatives.
While the President has lost a strategic leap ahead of other politicians because of the unpleasant event, there are still a few ways to get him back – for example, by choosing a future prime minister.
While the chances of getting a prime minister’s chair in my eyes are diminished, entrepreneurs approach Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> on the contrary.
While the electoral development is so far miles away from the early and smooth establishment of a stable government, compared to the pre-election scenario of the left-wing government supported by the Communists, this development for business in the Czech Republic and thus the economy is only better news.
Given the strong opposition of the ANO to be put together with the ODS or TOP 09, the most likely variant of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, ANO and KDU-<0xC4><0x8C>SL coalition (a total of 111 MEPs) is still the most likely variant.
Given the fragmentation in the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, which has become an illegible and weak part of the negotiations, the result of coalition negotiations can be quite disastrous for the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
The minority government of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, composed of "nationmen" on the Castle, is unlikely to pass.
In addition, any government in which the CSSD will participate will be threatened by the dissatisfied ambitions of many Social Democrats, which may sooner or later lead to another split in the party.
So I ask myself, “Are we not succeeding by self-defeating to the next early elections?”
The next election would be a referendum on the power of the voting mandate of the YES movement.
The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD’s plans to introduce sectoral taxes, significantly increases in income taxes or the construction of the state bank have, hopefully, fallen under the table.
The parties <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, ANO, KDU-<0xC4><0x8C>SL and <0xC3><0x9A>svit, on the other hand, agree, for example, on promoting business, a strenuous fiscal policy (government deficit below 3% of GDP), to support employment for disadvantaged people, lower VAT rates for selected goods.
The third areas are most prominent in terms of social policy and the size of the state.
Yes, but now it has a top, so the most likely AY, <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, KDU-<0xC4><0x8C>SL coalition so far would be inclined to the right.
Which, in my view, is a better result than the left-wing program with taxes on everything that is still moving in the economy.
