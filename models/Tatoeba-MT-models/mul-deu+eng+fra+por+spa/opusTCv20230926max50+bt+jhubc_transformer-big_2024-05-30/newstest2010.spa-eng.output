Barack Obama to be the fourth U.S. president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway to spend 26 hours and receive the Nobel Peace Prize, as the fourth U.S. president in history.
The <0x24>1.4 million diploma, medal and cheque will be received, among other things, for the exceptional effort in strengthening global diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will arrive in the Norwegian metropolis in the morning and have a lot to do.
First, a visit to the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time with the five members of the committee which, in October, elected him from 172 people and 33 organizations.
Afterwards, the presidential couple is scheduled to meet with the King of Norway, Harald V, and Queen Sonia.
In the afternoon, the visit will culminate in a ceremony in which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
It will be the fourth U.S. president to receive it, although the third to receive it in office.
The White House has already announced that, upon receiving the award, it will talk about the Afghan war.
The President does not want to avoid this issue, knowing that he is receiving the award as president of a country that is currently at war in two countries.
His war efforts increased even more with the dispatch of additional troops to Afghanistan, not to mention any of his critics.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive the gold medal, diploma and cheque of 10 million Swedish kronor (approximately 24 million Czech kronor).
It is proposed to donate charitable paraffins, but has not yet decided which organization in particular.
During their full program, the President and his wife will attend a banquet to which, in addition to the Norwegian kings, the Prime Minister and 250 other guests will attend.
From the beginning, Obama had a rather reserved attitude towards the prize.
He mentioned, for example, having the feeling that he didn’t deserve it at all.
He also repeated several times that the prize is not only for him, but for all those who fight for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he mentioned that it represents “a challenge to take action.”
Defendant of nature accused of blackmail
The Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice police accused the president of the Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice Society of Nature Defenders (Sociedad de defensores de la naturaleza Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice) of blackmail.
Last year he appealed several times against some building licences procedures and to withdraw the appeals he demanded money from investors for his own benefit, Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice police spokeswoman Alena Romová said.
The president of the Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice Nature Defenders Society is Lubomír Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
He is currently detained and faces a sentence of up to three years in prison.
Brno does not like containers too much to separate garbage
In Prague, citizens can separate beverage packaging and in the villages of southern Moravia you can find containers to separate garbage everywhere.
And in Brno?
There it takes several minutes to find the respective containers.
I do not want to say that in Brno, garbage is not separated for nothing.
It seems to me that, to be the second largest city in the Republic, the municipalities are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is totally behind the garbage separation, not only because we, the citizens, can only use containers to separate paper, glass and plastic, but above all by the number of containers for such waste.
Have you ever, for example, tried to throw a PET bottle in the center to the right container?
It is almost impossible, especially it requires a lot of time and patience.
The only place I have found so far is in Moravské nám<0xC4><0x9B>stí square, opposite the Potrefená Huse.
Don't be angry with me, Mr. Underka and his colleagues, but that seems too little to me.
It is not necessary to mention that in other parts it is also not easy to separate garbage.
That's why many of my friends prefer not to separate it.
By Vacancy
What happens is that the containers are far away.
I'm not surprised.
I myself offered, after a party, to throw in the trash several bottles of glass and plastic.
But in Calle Kaunicova I saw no red container nearby.
Fortunately, going to the tram I found the right place.
However, the garbage was already leaking from the container.
It remains the center of Brno, the most representative part of the city, isn’t it?!
What happens is that ecology and aesthetics do not seem to be of too much interest to Brno socialists.
They prefer to buy the city the hockey extra league, which embarrasses us throughout the republic, and not buy more containers or offer the separation of other materials for Brno to be cleaner.
I am glad to be able to compare my hypothesis, after browsing the Internet a little, with the official statistics.
According to the company EKO-KOM, Brno is indeed the worst in the entire region of Jihomoravsk<0xC3><0xBD> kraj.
The budget of "Paroubek" removed money from income and disease subsidies
After the left, despite the government’s opinion, added funds for farmers or officials, there may not be enough money in the budget for income, sickness subsidies or construction savings.
But not for the interests of state debt or international litigation.
This will harm all those who rule in the second half of next year, says Treasury Minister Eduard Janota.
When social democrats and communists imposed the increase for some groups, they were assured that the government would subsequently ask for a loan for sensitive expenses, income or disease subsidies. “That only means postponing the problems for the future, it’s placing mines,” says Janota.
What happens is that, when borrowed money is taken, you have to pay ever-increasing interest and, someday, you have to return the money.
The state does not have many options to get money.
If it does not reduce social subsidies or state operating expenses, it has to increase taxes.
To all who have added the left now: the firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And, later, his children too.
People don't have to worry about sickness income or subsidies, they'll get them, 1.8 billion of these accounts disappeared.
But the price to be paid will be the increase in public debt; next year there will be no shortage of only 163 billion in the treasury, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will continue to increase alongside interest expenses.
The state will need money to cover them and will no longer come with a slight increase in VAT or a reduction in maternity allowances, as the government did in its anti-deficit package.
Due to money displacements for some groups of voters, next year will also be five billion to complete the construction of highways and railways.
These are, above all, the sectors in which the tender has already been held and where the construction process has already begun, whose projects cannot be changed and their price cannot be reduced either.
The best thing you can do is keep them, which is also not free.
That means the delay or cessation of the thirty major constructions; the possibility of obtaining European funds is also in danger, said Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
<0xC4><0x8C>SSD proposed a Salomonic solution for the reduction of funds: it will get money from the dividends of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ, which is mostly state-owned, and will add the transport fund.
The problem is that the value of the dividend is never safe nor is it a bottomless bag.
Last year <0xC4><0x8C>EZ allocated the budget to 18 billion.
Each year, dividends are paid off for environmental damage, used to complete the account for income or as a reserve for the prepared income reform.
In addition, with this trick, according to EU rules, the real budget deficit increases to the level of 5.7% of GDP.
The money transfer carnival doesn't end here.
Almost three billion were obtained from the budget to grant several compensations to victims of communism and crimes, or for litigation expenses, even in construction savings.
It is unclear whether the state will need such funds.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international dispute, we may have to pay for it, Janota says.
Then, the Minister will have to save money within the spring or, in the worst case, drop the government budget reserve.
There are also a hundred million missing for the Statní pokladna (State Box) project, which is priced at two billion and which has already been started. It should allow online monitoring of what the different authorities are spending on.
The first stage starts in January.
If the finance minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project will have to stop and sanctions will come, warned Janota.
Your future smartphone will be able to work with two operating systems
Americans will have a mobile phone on which the user will be able, by pressing a key, to switch between several operating systems.
The revealed plans sound promising.
With just pressing a key, they switch in a few seconds from Windows Mobile to Android.
This is precisely the goal of the American company VMware, which focuses primarily on the development of virtualization software for computers.
On your mobile you can carry two user profiles at once.
They can change between them and divide them between home and work.
Both operate at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware in an interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and several days ago it was demonstrated for the first time.
It will be launched in 2012.
The virtualization of smartphones is no longer a fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated journalists how the smartphone works with two operating systems.
It was the Nokia N800, modified with a 128 MB RAM, where the mentioned systems, Windows Mobile and Android, run at the same time.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is at its peak.
VMware collaborates with European and US operators to test smartphone virtualization and these phones will reach customers in 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains worries hoteliers
Not only do the skiers in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e worry about the snow-free slopes.
The lack of snow causes people not to book ski stays in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e you can still get free rooms for all winter dates, including for Goodnight and Evening Eve.
We have a lot of visitors on our pages.
People look at offers, check prices, but are still afraid to book with commitment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask about our opinion, whether there will be snow or mud this Christmas," said Martin Jandura, the owner of the information portal Spindl.Info.
Those who want to spend a night at <0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v Ml<0xC3><0xBD>n according to their expectations, should no longer hesitate to book your stay.
Those who prefer to save money and put quality accommodation in second place, can try to wait a few more days.
Hoteliers in <0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v Ml<0xC3><0xBD>n mainly offer weekly stays for Nightlife.
I think they will continue to offer them, but soon they will surrender and offer shorter stays.
And then the free rooms will be sold quickly, Jandura said.
Ingotours, a Vrchlabí travel agency, continues to offer free beds for all winter dates.
Now what interests us most is the Christmas week, which is not yet complete.
Half of the seats offered are still free.
That’s why we’ve already prepared some last-minute Christmas breaks,” said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabí travel agency can still offer the Nightlife in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e, but there are fewer vacancies.
They sell very well also the first fourteen days of February, the remaining winter dates are sold regularly.
This year's interest in winter stays is undermined by the lack of snow in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e.
People are waiting to see if there is snow.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes remain snowy during the week, the Christmas dates will also be exhausted,” Schiefert said.
On the contrary, it is a little easier to occupy the rooms at the Horizont hotel in Pec pod Sn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>kou; last year was more difficult.
We're about five percent better.
For Easter and Christmas, we have the last free seats.
Interest increases during the Polish holidays in January and February also sells well," said Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
Eighty percent of Nochevieja’s accommodations are also occupied at the Omnia Hotel, near the central parking lot in Janské Lázn<0xC4><0x9B>.
On the contrary, in the most recent Janské Lázn<0xC4><0x9B> hotel at Christmas half of the beds are still free.
This January was a big surprise for us, as we are at about sixty percent of the occupancy capacity.
February has been a little weaker, but as soon as snow falls, interest in stays in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e will surely increase, said Erik Sporysch, the director of the Omnia hotel.
However, for the time being, it seems that the hoteliers in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e will have the desire for snow waiting.
On Thursday temperatures should fall and, if there is rain, in the mountains it should snow.
But then the temperatures will rise again, reported Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Jakubsk<0xC3><0xBD> from Hradec Králové, of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
U.S.: Repeat is the Mother of Wisdom
It’s funny that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest man, as a diligent student repeats in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, which he himself considered the dumbest.
When he finally revealed his anxious Afghan approach, it was shown to be a copy of the script used for Iraq by Bush, created three years ago.
Not only is the same text used several times the phrase "equal to Iraq", but it also did not hesitate to use the title of Bush's January 2007 statement for his own statement: "A new way forward."
It was he himself, who three years ago criticized Bush’s idea of sending new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country that is suffering from the civil war, and that criticized it as “an irresponsible decision with catastrophic consequences.”
The following months, however, proved that Bush’s strategy, based on the recommendations of the field captains, was the only possible and successful, so that today nothing about Iraq is spoken of in the news.
Bush’s reputation did not improve, but objectively left his successor a much more favourable initial situation than expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes the miracle will be repeated.
The field captains once again asked him to increase the military contingent, especially commander-in-chief of the Afghan General Operation Stanley McCristal. He, despite traditional subordinate relations, subjected the indecisive gunmen in the White House to harsh criticism.
He asked 40,000 men to improve the situation.
The president vacillated for three months, but nothing better happened to him, so at least he fooled the general over 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to get Europe to promise him another 5,000, although he himself had at least 10,000 before.
The most problematic of all Obama’s strategy seems to be his goal, to start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and finish this procedure in three years.
Many doubt that the increase will bear the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars in recent years, Iraq’s society is relatively well organized, its leaders respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: it is not possible to trust anyone and no agreement is fulfilled.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, if they are used to changing the head every day according to their needs.
The political institutions, although formally established, will remain only a Potemkin people, after which patriarchal tribal relations will remain.
Balance the interests of different ethnic groups is extraordinarily complicated due to confusing relations, even more complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Not even establishing a state that is "capable of action", a minimum goal of the whole operation, seems very real.
The horizon of Obama’s strategy is shocked by his volunteerism.
For the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to deteriorate and is now about to erupt.
Only a romantic soul, who knows nothing about reality, can believe that the military sent to war to "return home soon", will do some miracle here.
From a political point of view, fixing the date of the withdrawal of troops is pure irresponsibility, as the Taliban will consider it an indirect declaration of American defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that Europeans are less and less willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians do not know, nor do they want to explain to their voters, what the security of Germany or Italy has to do with the war with the Hindu Kush.
The other factor, capable of radically affecting the situation, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions do not have any effect on the Iranians, the U.S. will have to make a difficult decision: try to resolve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to look for answers precisely when, according to Obama, America begins the triumphant withdrawal of Afghan troops.
However, each such solution will mean a dramatic reversal to the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years left for the presidential election and that’s why there’s still a lot of time left to find another strategy, if it turns out to be a total failure.
Goldman Sachs Bank Managers Will Not Receive Cash Bonuses Again
The senior executives of the U.S. bank Goldman Sachs will not receive cash bonuses this year.
The entity announced it to react to the harsh criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 senior executives will receive, instead of money, shares that cannot be sold within a minimum of five years.
In addition, the shares may be withdrawn in the event that they have assumed excessive risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs has thus become the leader in the effort to combine bonuses on Wall Street with long-term power.
I guess Wall Street is fully aware of the longest path it must take, said former JPMorgan bank investor Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs faced criticism after spending nearly <0x24>17 billion (almost CZK 300 billion) on bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of bonuses in the entity for this year, according to the Reuters agency, is likely to exceed, despite the measure announced today, <0x24>20 billion.
High bonuses in the banking sector became, with the advent of the financial crisis, a delicate issue in politics.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to tax at once, with a 50 percent tax, bank bonuses for bankers exceeding <0xC2><0xA3>25,000 (approximately CZK 712,000).
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year women received the Nobel Prize in all categories except Physics
Five women, which is a record number, received today in Stockholm from King Charles XVI Gustavo of Sweden the Nobel Prizes this year, in specialized categories and in literature.
In addition to the four scientists, she also included a German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded by two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, as well as her compatriot Jack Szostak for research on chromosomes.
The Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonathan and Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz for their explanation of the structure and function of the ribosomes.
The latest award, the Nobel Prize in Economics, was given by the American Elinor Ostrom and his compatriot Oliver Williamson for the analysis of an economic report.
The only specialized category, without a prize-winning woman, was Physics.
This award was received today by scientists Charles Kao for research in the field of optical cables, and George Smith with Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which forms the basis of all digital cameras, faxes, or telescopes.
Each awardee collected the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of the money received.
This sum in each category is up to 10 million Swedish krona (approximately 25 million Czech krona).
In case there are several prizes in each category, the prize is awarded to each other.
The traditionally most awaited Nobel Peace Prize was received this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, by U.S. President Barack Obama.
In his speech he acknowledged the controversy that he had been awarded, as he is at the beginning of his career and is also at the head of a country that participates in two wars: in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
In order to defend its policy, he added, however, that in certain situations wars are essential to achieving peace, even if its price is high.
Minister Janota considers resignation. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will receive on Friday morning Finance Minister Eduard Janota, who is considering his stay in the government, as he does not agree with the version of the state budget for next year, approved Wednesday by the House of Deputies.
The budget, and perhaps Janota’s stay in the cabinet, is supposed to be the topics of her Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too big, which continues to deepen the public finance crisis.
The meeting was reported by President Radim Ochvat.
On his stay in office, Janota wants to negotiate on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget law, prepared to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should govern with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The House of Deputies, however, approved proposals from the left for fund transfers on Wednesday and increased money for civil servants' salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government does not agree with the proposals of the Social Democrats, as they covertly increase the budget deficit.
Between the left and the government, on the one hand, Klaus and the right, on the other, there was a serious internal political conflict. Due to this conflict, the future activities of Fischer’s bureaucratic office, whose form was agreed in the spring by the ODS, <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and the Green Party, are beginning to be controversial.
Critics claim that the budget, in the House-approved version, de facto liquidates the package of austerity measures, imposed in the fall by the Fischer government to curb public debt.
Klaus may but does not have to sign the law on the state budget; today he stated during a breakfast with businessmen that politicians had long neglected "the serious problem", i.e., "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
According to him, they no longer have a good solution.
Only a strong government, which can be supported by a broader consensus among political parties, could improve this situation, the president said.
ODS leader Mirek Topolánek mentioned that the budget is frightening and that the government should think about its future existence.
The vice president of ODS, Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as, told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that the concept of bureaucratic office with the support of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, ODS and the Greens obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer reacted and described similar words as “strong sentences.”
The head of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Paroubek, reacted to Topolanek saying that the budget deficit is horrific, prepared for this year by the former government of Topolanek.
On Wednesday, the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD said that the approval of the state budget for the coming year was successful.
The folks were happy too.
Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new film, starring Morgan Freeman
South Africans claim that Hollywood’s new film, Invictus: Invincible, tells a lot about the country, its struggle and its victories, although some critics say the protagonists are American actors.
The story talks about sports, racial relationships and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is portrayed in his biography by Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said Mandela, 91, asked him to play him in the Eastwood film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I said, "When I interpret it, I'll have to have access to you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who received the award for his role in Eastwood's drama about the world of boxing Million Dollar Baby, played the role of the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, who ended up being a slave, of all the fictitious people for the U.S. president, but he is so rarely alive, and even to represent God in Tovan.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his activities to end apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and for four years became president of the country.
In 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - Invincible is a Latin word and the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film is a real story about Nelson Mandela, who joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to help unite the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that after apartheid his nation continues to be racially and economically divided.
He believes that he is able to unite his people through sport, and that is why he decides to unite rugby players, who belong to the global extent to the outsiders.
The South African team managed to reach the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked several years to get Mandela’s story to the cinemas.
I had no other goal but to play this role in such a way that it was as much like reality as possible, Freeman said.
Of course, the biggest challenge was to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were out of the same area, he would have tried to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, be in the backyard before his speech.
Most importantly, I wanted to squeeze Mandela's hand.
I discovered that by squeezing her hand, I receive her energy, it is transmitted and I had the feeling of knowing how you feel, she said.
It’s important to me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays the role of François Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, in which white players prevailed.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the hard world of rugby.
A big surprise for him was, when he finally met with Pienaar at his home.
I remember calling the door, he opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, “In the movie I look much higher.”
Despite the obvious differences between the characters of the actors and their real models, and under the direction of director Eastwood, Invictus: Invincible received positive reviews and also talks about Oscar ambitions.
Daily Variety magazine film critic Todd McCarthy summed up his assessment with these words: "It was a very good story, a very well made film."
In film reviews on rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The secret of splendor over Norway solved: the Russians tested a missile
A special luminous effect of unknown origin was observed in Norway.
The Russian Defense Ministry finally acknowledged yesterday that near the borders with Norway it tested a ballistic intercontinental missile.
The missile, of the type "Bulava", formerly intended to be the pride of the Russian army, is becoming the nightmare of the Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Not even its repeated presence in missile testing has had the desired effect on the success of test flights.
Bulava, in most cases, did not fly out or a failure occurred in the air.
In Russian newspapers they write of "Bulava" as "a missile that does not fly".
A missile that doesn't fly, but shines.
During this, the 13th test, no problems occurred at first.
At the end of the flight, technical problems occurred again in the aircraft.
Probably the engine exploded in the third stage of the missile.
This time "Bulava" was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, which was floating submerged in the White Sea.
This type of missile makes it possible to launch from a vessel that is moving and is submerged at the same time.
That is why it is likely that the mysterious light over Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, was actually the failed "Bulava".
The Norwegians, from the very beginning, did not hesitate to say that it was a Russian missile.
The generals defend themselves this time by affirming that we can’t just talk about failure.
The first two stages of the missile survived and the failure occurred in the third.
In the above cases the engines immediately failed in the first stage.
Although none of the launches went completely error-free, according to the Ministry of Defence management only six out of thirteen failed.
The success of nearly fifty percent is full of optimism to generals and that is why they continue to claim that "Bulavá" will one day fly smoothly and that it will even manage to carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear blocks, whose maximum total weight is 1.15 tons.
At the age of 51, legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with Moscow CSKA
The legendary defender Viacheslav Fetisov will return to a professional hockey game at the age of 51.
Former world champion, Olympic champion and winner of the Stanley Cup will help his team CSKA Moscow and possibly play Friday in the KHL duel against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov finished his professional career at the age of forty in 1998 and currently presides over the CSKA.
After Denis Kulyash gets hurt, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov is constantly practicing and is committed to helping the team.
We just have to solve some formal issues, the AP agency quoted Sergei Nemchinov, the coach of the Moscow club.
It is not yet clear whether the return of the famous player will refer to a single game.
I think Fetisov is one of those who manage to raise the mood of the other players, Nemchinov said.
According to AP, if Fetisov returns to the ice rink, he will become the longest-standing professional player in Russian hockey.
Legendary forward Gordie Howe played in the NHL for Hartford at the age of fifty-one, throughout the season, and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The largest of the group of five famous players Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
Playing for the Soviet Union he won two Olympic golds, seven world championships, won the Canadian Cup and the junior world championship.
In the second part of his career he also had success in the NHL: playing with Detroit he won the Stanley Cup twice.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the Hall of Hockey Glory.
Hyundai meets trade union requirements. It will cancel all additional work
The management of the automotive factory in No<0xC5><0xA1>ovice agreed with the unions to cancel all additional work.
Precisely because of the frequent additional work, the unions declared a strike emergency on Monday.
The information was confirmed by Petr Van<0xC4><0x9B>k, the carrier of the Hyundai car factory.
The management, however, wants to agree with the trade unions for this year a further turn of Saturday.
We cannot resign from our manufacturing plan, as it is essential. That is why we proposed additional volunteer work for Saturday 19 December, that is, it will be worked in two turns, said Vanek.
According to the server Sedmi<0xC4><0x8D>ka.cz, the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees working on the Saturday shift.
The bonus will also be paid for last Saturday, November 28.
According to Va<0xC5><0x88>ka, the company decided to change the way to motivate its employees with the additional work offered.
Employees can charge the bonus for overtime or take a day off on December 28, i.e. extending Christmas holidays in one day, said Vanek.
In addition, all Saturday shift employees will receive money for the trip and for the meal.
Because the supplementary work was the most urgent and problematic point of the comments and complaints of the unionists and strikers, who stopped manufacturing last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon to immediately cancel all the supplementary work for the month of December, said Vanek.
The car factory employees were forced to work two more hours in addition to eight-hour shifts and this situation lasted almost every day until last week.
After signing the agreement, the unions will cancel the strike emergency.
Another negotiation between the factory management and the trade unionists should take place on Monday morning.
Trade union chief Petr Kucha<0xC5><0x99> said on Wednesday that if they commit to complying with the requirements and signing the document, they are willing to cancel the emergency by strike.
The situation at the car factory aggravated last week on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously went on strike for frequent additional jobs.
They also protested against poor payment conditions and alleged harassment.
The management said employees had to work extra hours to meet the requirements and be able to supply the cars.
The unionists in their statement on Monday’s strike emergency also demanded that none of the employees, who discontinued manufacturing on Wednesday, be penalized in any way.
As far as supplementary work is concerned, unions require the company to minimize it.
In addition, this year they require a salary of 5,000 crowns for this work.
The car factory in No<0xC5><0xA1>ovice Hyundai currently employs 2,000 people.
Mass production began last November.
As of last September, it produced approximately 80,000 cars; its current production potential is 200,000 cars per year.
A Czech discovery: an effective substance even in the ‘enclosed’ HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists tests new compounds capable of moderating the spread of HIV in the organism
The main advantage of this enhanced substance is the fact that it is also effective against drug-resistant viruses.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective in a common variant of the virus, as some medicines are already available.
AIDS can’t be cured until now.
However, the lives of patients can be significantly prolonged thanks to a mixture of drugs that prevent the replication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, its use has many side effects.
If the replication of the virus is not completely suppressed, so-called resistant viruses will be created; against them, the drugs no longer work.
The work of experts from three Institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, V<0xC5><0xA0>CHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg demonstrates the possibility of mastering the resistance of the virus.
They demonstrated that substances called metalocarbons have an effect on albumin, which is responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
The metallocarbons are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a different way than all the drugs used today, and therefore can solve the resistance problem.
In their work, scientists find new, ‘improved’ compounds, prepared knowing the molecular mechanism of their binding to the virus’s albumin.
Metalocarbons have a single three-dimensional structure: two polyedric cages composed of the boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are joined by the metal atom, in this case by cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus
HIV proteasis is an albumin of the HIV virus, and is essential for the virus's vital cycle.
Without HIV proteasis, the HIV virus is not fracturing and no mature and infectious corpuscles of the virus would be created.
If we stop HIV proteasis, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient’s body, the scientists explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In an article published in the Journal of Medical Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds, in which two pairs of cages (see table) are joined by a short organic series, which continues to be systematically modified.
A little weaker, but more effective
The test of the effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was performed in probe, and also against its resistant variants, obtained from HIV patients.
The effect of metallocarbons on the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as in clinically used drugs, however they do not lose their effect on resistant variants, in which drugs often do not work.
The mechanism of the unique effect, its other qualities such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications makes metallocarbons interesting compounds for research with the aim of proposing effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína <0xC5><0xA0>ezá<0xC4><0x8D>ová, the head of the biodemiology laboratory at the Institute of Organic Biology and the Institute of Chemical Structural Biology.
The ODS attacked Fischer, he defends himself.
ODS chief Mirek Topolánek said the budget approved for next year is “horrible” and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, according to him, think about its future existence.
The ODS statements were noted by the Prime Minister as strong sentences.
They say that time is left for analysis.
ODS Vice President Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as said that the concept of bureaucratic office with the support of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as, the prime minister has to decide whether in the House of Deputies he wants to rely on the minority, which is trying to fight the growing deficit, or whether he wants to stay in his position with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of SDGs and social democracy towards the public deficit issue is completely different, Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as warned.
The House of Representatives yesterday approved the budget for 2010, however with the proposed amendments by the left, for more than 12 billion crowns.
The House of Deputies increased money for government officials’ salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed the proposals for the SDGs, as they covertly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should govern with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
ODS left the room before the vote and thus fulfilled the government’s wish, that the modified budget is better than a provisional budget.
Disappointment and uselessness
Treasury Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and sense of futility; Prime Minister Jan Fischer mentioned that the government will reassess the current situation.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened to resign in the event of approval of the amendments, the situation could have been different.
According to <0xC4><0x8C>eská TV, Janota requested a meeting with the Prime Minister.
He said he was thinking about staying in office.
The reason is their disappointment with the budget negotiations.
If Fischer agrees with another fight against the budget deficit, according to Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as in the government have nothing to do with the nominees for the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, which imposed the changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also say clearly, if he resigns, if the House approves other laws that increase the deficit, such as those relating to sickness subsidies, income, or the amendment of the Service Act.
Topolánek: Ministers nominated by the ODS are not to blame
This is the case of Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS have done nothing wrong, Topolánek stressed in the U.S. text news.
He recalled that in several ministries in the posts of lieutenant there are people who belong to the TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as stressed, that if Fischer decides to resign the principle of struggle with the height of the public finance deficit, "it is absolutely logical and correct, that it is based on the leftist majority, which is currently in the House of Representatives."
However, it will not be able to count on the support and tolerance of the ODS members.
I have not thought about it, when the time is right, I will take care of it, said Defence Minister Martin Barták, who was appointed to the government precisely by the members of the ODS.
In the afternoon, Prime Minister Fischer went to a meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
ODS surrendered at the request of the Prime Minister
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as stressed that ODS on Wednesday in the House of Deputies would likely vote against the amended budget, if the prime minister does not explicitly ask ODS deputies to allow the budget to be accepted.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not small children, he responded to the question, whether ODS is not concerned about the absence of the party leader in parliament and in the Czech Republic, during the budget negotiations.
I didn't realize my vote was missing.
Upon resigning from the mandate, he knew that in the following months it was mainly about the bolchevization of the House of Deputies and the destruction of everything positive, Topolánek himself reacted.
According to the new train schedule of <0xC4><0x8C>D, fewer trains will circulate for almost the same rates
<0xC4><0x8C>eské dráhy (Czech Railways) from 13 December will cancel or restrict some less-used fast and local trains and, on the contrary, will strengthen some links.
The total extension of traffic will be reduced by two percent compared to today, after the new train schedule comes into force.
Most rates including the basic and customer price will not change.
More possibilities of links to the capital will be gained, for example, by the inhabitants of the region of Ostravsko, dráhy for this line will add a pedestrian carriage.
The direct train, on the other hand, will not return to Bratislava.
On the Prague - Písek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice line fewer fast trains will circulate, direct connections Prague - Letohrad will be restricted.
In the regions, the largest reduction of transport planned by drahy is in the Hradec Králové region, eight percent in total, on the contrary, transport will increase in Prague and its surroundings.
Two night trains will also be cancelled on the Prague - Tábor - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice route and some fast trains on the Prague - Písek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice line will only be reduced to a few days a week.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice have to change in Lysá nad Labem.
It is the 15th line of the Esko system, in the vicinity of the cities, its opening is possible thanks to the electrification of the line from Lysá nad Labem to Milovice.
Long-distance connections to the capital will end at Prague Hlavní nádra<0xC5><0xBE>í station.
<0xC4><0x8C>D will introduce more SC Pendolino connections between Prague and Ostrava and trains to <0xC5><0xA0>umperk/Jeseník will circulate every two hours.
From December 13, travellers will not travel to Bratislava in Pendolino again.
This year’s count for regional railways: 200 million more than before
Fast trains are commissioned and paid by the Ministry of Transport, to cover the so-called demonstrable losses Dráhy will receive four billion crowns in total, just like this year. Local trains are commissioned by the regions, next year will pay eight billion crowns in total, and the state will help them almost three billion.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For high-speed and local drahy trains have a new ten-year contract, so far the contract was always one-year.
Dr<0xC4><0x81>hy are happy with the system, and maybe that’s why they didn’t raise the prices of a large majority of the tickets.
Changes will only occur on one-day tickets - <0xC4><0x8C>D Net and on cheap eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka internet tickets.
For travelers without a customer card, the price of <0xC4><0x8C>D Net will increase from 450 SEK to 600 SEK.
The price of eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka will depend on the distance, so far the unique price of 160 kroner existed for trips between any two regional cities.
Filipino Armed Forces Continue to Detain More Than 50 People, Children Arrested
The gunmen have kidnapped 75 people in southern the Philippines today, including several primary school students and their teachers.
This was stated by AFP, which previously reported only about 65 kidnapped.
All 17 children detained and one teacher were released after eight hours.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
They say about 19 gunmen use hostages as a living shield in the escape to the police.
Local negotiators are trying to agree on the delivery of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the armed forces belong to the New People's Armed Forces (NPA), an armed fraction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, police had previously pursued the kidnappers because of violence, the cause of which was the adjustment of accounts between two clans of local families.
In the south of the Philippines in the province of Maguindanao it was because of the recent massacre, in which 57 people were killed, imposed martial law.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre, related to the governor’s election, were 30 journalists.
On suspicion of involvement in the massacre they arrested the governor of this province in the south of the Philippines and their father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of an influential Ampatuan dynasty.
On the island of Mindanao there are also Muslim separatists.
However, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The history of RSA refers to everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the coming days, a new Hollywood film by Clint Eastwood Invictus (his official Czech title is Invictus: Nepora<0xC5><0xBE>en<0xC3><0xBD>) will be released in American cinemas, capturing part of the biography of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-renowned apartheid fighter is played by Morgan Freeman, whom he chose years ago for the role of Mandela himself.
The second role, that of legendary rugby champion Francoise Pienaar, was played by Matt Damon.
With the premiere are born from the reactions of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
His full name was Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela. He was born on 18 July 1918 in Mvezo, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sacharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, in 1993 he received, alongside Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
great hopes, as it comes to the public at the time, when in the Republic of South Africa are culminating preparations for the world football championship. At the same time the media are shocked by alarming news about the growing racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants by the dominant black majority.
According to the AP news agency, the reactions to this new film on RSA have been positive, despite numerous reservations against the distribution of the protagonist roles by the "uninteresting" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman, however, says he is proud of the new film.
For many years I dreamed of the role and prepared myself well to perform it.
Many times I met in person with Nelson Mandela, to – as they say – charge for his energy, he mentioned in an interview after the festive premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it’s good, if through the film we can remember Mandela’s character and message.
It is a story of the Republic of South Africa, but it refers to everyone, he added.
In the suit of the national rugby team
The film is based on the book by British writer John Carlin with the title freely translated In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game. Thanks to this game the nation was born. It portrays the South African human rights lawyer during his first presidential term.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to unite two groups of residents, racially and for long separate years. Like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also puts on the costume of the South African national rugby team and enters the field. RSA won the world cup at the time.
By entering the gramilla in the suit, which in RSA is considered something almost sacred, Mandela won great ovations fourteen years ago, especially from the white public and the recognition of white residents.
The football championship may be able to help people unite and form a nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
It will still be seen if it improves the tense situation in the RSA.
The white South Africans, however, are skeptical, as for example said in a recent interview with LN rugby enthusiast Christopher Dawson, who fled his country to Britain.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
In Lounsko burns a transformer worth tens of millions of crowns
The fire seized a transformer from the company <0xC4><0x8C>eps in a switch box near the village of Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kov in Lounsko.
According to Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Marvan, a spokesman for the <0xC3><0x9A>stí region firefighters, the fire is extinguished by six groups.
Previously, firefighters wanted to let the transformer be destroyed by the fire, but later changed their mind and the fire is extinguishing it with a mixture of water, foam and a special extinguisher.
The fire was caused by a technical defect, the short circuit of the transformer.
There were no injuries, according to Pavla Mandatova, the company’s spokeswoman, the failure does not jeopardize the safe operation of the distribution system.
The estimated damage is several million crowns, it will not be possible to list it exactly before the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandatova, it will be necessary to replace the transformer destroyed by a new one.
During the ten years of <0xC4><0x8C>eps’ activity, nothing similar happened, the avarices of this type are sporadical, he added.
According to Sona Holingerová Hendrychová, the spokeswoman of the company <0xC4><0x8C>EZ for the northern Czech Republic, the supply of electricity was not cut, and the fire of the substation did not affect the operation of homes, offices or businesses.
A.s. <0xC4><0x8C>eps operated in the territory of the Czech Republic as the exclusive maintainer of the distribution system, of the 400 kV and 220 kV electric conduction.
It maintains in good condition, renews and develops 39 switch boxes with 67 transformers, which carry the electrical power from the transmission system to the distributor system, and maintains the electrical drive of 4339 kilometers in length.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura will file a complaint for calumnia three weeks from <0xC4><0x8C>SSD
Student Agency owner Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura will today file a complaint for slander against three social-democratic hetmans.
It is the district of Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek of the South Moravian Region, Radko Martínek of Pardubic<0xC3><0xBD> Region and the hetman of Olomouc<0xC3><0xBD> kraj Martin Tesa<0xC5><0x99>ík.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura mentioned it in Twenty Minutes on Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnal.
The demand has to do with the company’s efforts to maintain regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions, however, ended up signing long-term contracts with <0xC4><0x8C>eské dráhy.
All three Hetmans are attacking us and talking about the fact that we’re “taking the pass of the cake,” yet we only brought the offer for what they themselves wanted.
They say that we are more expensive than <0xC4><0x8C>eské dráhy, which is not true. We know the prices of <0xC4><0x8C>eské dráhy, which were set last week.
So we have nothing but to defend ourselves.
It is because of the slander towards the Student Agency society, he told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnal Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura.
He mentioned having the tests of all regions at the same time. According to him, they have not taken the necessary measures in accordance with European law.
That is why he is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek considers this complaint to be the continuation of Mr. Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura’s media show, which serves as free advertising for his company and for himself.
Of course I am prepared to defend my good reputation and that of my region and I appeal to the other Hetmans to do so as well.
I suppose that this time, too, it will be clearly demonstrated that Mr Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is manipulating the public on the issue of regional rail transport, and he uses false and false arguments, Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura announced last week that it would invest several million crowns in advertising, which would aim to warn of these measures from the regions.
He told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál that he would stop the campaign after Christmas and want to continue it after the New Year.
He said the campaign will be carried out against corruption as such.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura started the campaign after the regions agreed with <0xC4><0x8C>eské dráhy to maintain regional rail links and for the commission of about 150 billion crowns did not call for a tender.
According to Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, similar steps are in disagreement with the law and with the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura claims to have been threatened by a member of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, due to his criticism of rail transport in the regions.
The only threat was that if we didn't leave, we could lose bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, I know, which gentleman he is, I will not say his name, Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnal today.
The pneumococcal vaccine will be free and voluntary.
The pneumococcal vaccine will put an end to habits.
The first vaccine should be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However, there are already opinions that the mandatory vaccine would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the free pneumococcal vaccine culminate.
The Institute of Drugs is already setting the maximum prices of vaccines, which will be covered by insurance companies.
Experts already have this clear in the vaccination procedure.
The new vaccine
Free vaccines for children born in August
Beginning in January, children born on 2 August of last year will be able to receive the pneumococcal vaccine free of charge.
The condition is that you have not received a single dose of the vaccine before.
Those who started the vaccine last year or earlier must cover other doses of the vaccine as well.
The first dose of the vaccine must be received between the third and fifth month of age of the child.
Last year, a quarter of families volunteered to vaccinate their children against pneumococcus.
Parents, however, paid for a dose of 1600 crowns and more.
In order to vaccinate younger children, four doses are needed.
In general, experts estimate that insurance companies will spend 300 to 450,000 kroner per year on vaccines.
No clutch will save on treatment, which is needed for unvaccinated children.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 annually on all vaccinations of children.
Covered vaccination was initiated by the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcus is the cause of middle otitis, but also of severe infections including meningitis and septicemia.
Of pneumococcal infections in our country every year die according to research in hospitals 28 children not older than 10 years of age.
In addition to the Czech Republic, the pneumococcal vaccine cover in children was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be mandatory?
At the same time, however, opinions appear, that this vaccine could be mandatory in the future.
From January it must be covered by insurance companies and volunteers.
The mandatory vaccine would be better, for example, noted Rudolf Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD>, head of the Nahlas civic association.
His association has been spreading pneumococcal vaccines for a long time.
The experts at an international conference, at which our association participated, were not completely satisfied with the fact that we have the voluntary vaccine.
It is not entirely ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to achieve at least this.
I think that’s the way we have to go now,” Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD> said.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the pneumococcal vaccination procedure.
At this moment we do not think of it at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88>.
Voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages, doctors say
La presidenta de la sociedad de pediatras The Specialist Society of Practical Pediatricians Hana Cabrnochová recognizes that la vacuna voluntaria tiene sus desventajas.
"In the situation, when the vaccine costs such a high amount, we relatively understand the political decision to initiate vaccination as a volunteer," says Cabrnochová.
Experts expect that from next year more than 80 percent of young parents leave their babies vaccinated against pneumococcus.
The pneumococcal vaccine is a big change too because as the first vaccination in children is covered by health companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on prophylaxis, to save later on treatment, Cabrnochová explains.
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, pediatricians are concerned about the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, vaccines had to be purchased by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, just like when the state gave them other vaccines.
Some MPs, however, were afraid that insurance companies could “take out the money from health insurance.”
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines and wait until they are paid by insurance companies.
It is estimated that pediatricians will invest in 40,000 vaccines a month, which is a remarkable sum.
It will not be easy, says Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in “the theft of a museum”
The son of renowned American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta has been accused of attempting to steal paintings valued at <0x24>20 million (<0xC2><0xA3>12 million) from his father’s museum.
Pennsylvania police say Alfonso Frank Frazetta was arrested while loading 90 paintings in his vehicle and trailer.
They claim that Frazetta and another man used an excavator to break into the museum, in the Pocono Mountains region.
Frazetta father, 81, is famous for his representation of characters such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
The Associated Press reported that the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP reported that an unidentified police official claimed that a family dispute could have motivated the young Frazetta.
The agency said Frazatta's 52-year-old son had told police that his father had ordered him "enter the museum by any means to move all the paintings to a warehouse."
The agency said Father Frazetta refused to grant such permission.
The Labour Party defends tax increases in the budget
Ministers have defended tax increases and cuts in the pre-budget report, facing criticism from the opposition, companies and unions.
The Conservatives said Alistair Darling "wasted" an opportunity to show his seriousness about the deficit cut, delaying decisions until after the election.
The Treasury Minister also received harsh criticism for harming low- and middle-income workers.
Its main proposals include a 0.5% increase in Social Security expenditure and a 1% drop in public sector wage agreements from 2011.
Cholera for Social Security
Trade unions have lamented that low-wage workers are being punished with a recession generated by others, and warned of future “problems”.
The increase in Social Security spending, which will grow by around <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion a year, has angered the business community, which claims this is a job tax, when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those earning more than <0xC2><0xA3>20,000 a year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
KEY POINTS OF THE PREVIOUS INFORMATION ON THE PRESSURE
Social Security with an additional 0.5% increase as of April 2011
Economy will contract more than expected 4.75% this year
New 50% tax on bankers’ bonuses
The 1-point increase in corporate tax for small firms was ruled out
Tax breaks for electric cars and wind turbines
State pension would increase by 2.5 percent
According to the Ministry of Finance estimates, a person who earns <0xC2><0xA3>30,000 will lose <0xC2><0xA3>90 a year and a person who earns <0xC2><0xA3>40,000 will lose <0xC2><0xA3>190, while a person who earns <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 a year will earn <0xC2><0xA3>110.
The ministers said their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 involved "difficult decisions", but insisted that 60% of the additional tax burden would fall over 5% of the highest wages.
Treasury Secretary Stephen Timms denied that the tax increases and cuts in outlined spending were a "grain of sand in the desert" compared to what was needed.
"These are big figures. It will allow us to halve the deficit, which is absolutely essential for the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he was confident that the economy would grow again by the end of the year.
However, the Labour Party's forecasts for future economic growth, which will affect the amount to be borrowed and the speed with which the deficit will be reduced, have been questioned after the Minister of Finance was forced to modify the first figures.
In his statement, he said the economy was likely to contract by 4.75% this year, much worse than the 3.5% decline forecast in April, while the loan order would be <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion above the previously estimated.
"The Wasted Opportunity"
The Conservatives, who will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday, warning of the Labour party’s “debt crisis,” said the <0xC2><0xA3>789 billion loan application projection for the next six years was unsustainable.
The ministers had failed to present a credible plan on how they would return the money, they added, “cynically” bypassing the difficult options until after the elections to be held in June 2010.
"They didn't include anything significant about what they would do," the Minister said in the shadow of the Treasury Department, Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do so and they have wasted it."
“All important announcements will be made after the election, win who win.”
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour Party insists that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future cuts, unlike conservative proposals, which would seek a greater reduction of the deficit in the shorter term.
But liberal Democrats claimed that the money raised by tax increases and spending cuts would be used to sustain spending next year, not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the projects were like "sand castles".
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the time chosen for the announcements, such as the increase in inflation of some incapacity subsidies next April, mentioned above, would leave the Treasury Minister exposed to charges of electoral maneuvers, as the money could simply be recovered next year.
The Labour Party, however, insists that it is providing people with the most need, and the situation will be revised in September 2010.
"False budget"
Although ministers did not publish post-2011 spending data, economists said it was clear that adjustments to public spending would only be felt in the medium term.
The respected Institute of Tax Studies said the figures of the Treasury Minister involved substantial cuts in many areas, potentially in the future including transport, higher education, science and defense.
“This is really postponing the pain to a later date,” said its director, Robert Chote.
“All major announcements will come after the election, win who win,” said Roger Bootle, Deloitte’s economics consultant.
"This has been the fake pre-budget report. Markets realize this."
FBI Investigates U.S. Detention in Pakistan
The FBI is investigating the detention in Pakistan of five American men suspected of extremist connections.
The U.S. embassy in Pakistan told the BBC that the men were detained in a raid on a house in Sarghada, in the eastern province of Punjab.
The FBI has said it is investigating whether they are the same men who disappeared from their homes in the state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. State Department said it was also looking for information about men.
It is reported that three of them are of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
"If they are American citizens, of course we will be very interested in the charges for which they have been detained and in what kind of circumstances they are being detained," said spokesman Ian Kelly.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schwait said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their business there, if indeed these are the students who were missing," the spokeswoman said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington said the men were detained in a house belonging to the uncle of one of them.
He said the house was already in the spotlight of the local police and that no charges had yet been filed against the detainees.
Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the detentions, Reuters reported; but said the U.S. had to “work more closely with both Afghanistan and Pakistan, to try to eradicate the terrorist infrastructure that continues to recruit people.”
The families of the five students reported their disappearance in North Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty International condemns Iranian 'abuse'
Human rights in Iran for the past 20 years have always been equally deficient, according to a report by the Amnesty International campaign group.
The report details “models of abuse” of the regime, before and after the presidential election in June.
One man quoted in the report said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, and another said he was threatened with raping him.
Iran has rejected previous criticism of its history of human rights.
Officials have said that such criticisms have a political basis.
Thousands of people arrested and dozens killed in Iran after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's election provoked the largest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens have been convicted, and prosecutors say at least five people have been sentenced to death.
BBC correspondent in Tehran, Jon Leyne, who is now in London, says during the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Jamenei, acknowledged some allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention center.
But since then, the authorities have shown very little tolerance for criticism, according to our correspondent.
"False Confession"
Amnesty International quoted Ebrahim Mehtari, a 26-year-old computer student, as saying he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and protesting against the election result.
“They often hit me in the face,” he said.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, in my head... They threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
Amnesty said after five days he signed a false confession and released him and left on the street, still bleeding and semi-conscious.
In August, defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some protesters detained after the election had been tortured to death in prison, and others had been raped.
Iranian officials denied allegations of rape, but admitted that there had been abuses.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee, who claimed to have been kept in a container with 75 other people for more than eight weeks at a detention center in Kahrizak.
Amnesty recognized that the Iranian parliament and the judiciary had set up committees to investigate the discomfort of the post-election and the government’s response, but said the mandate and powers of the agencies were confused and the findings of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people had been arrested in the last three weeks, to prevent more demonstrations.
A ski slope was made in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a Bristol landmark into a competition track.
The track at the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who competed for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park there was a short jump ramp, opposite a 100-meter-long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the track, but it was quite scary.
You can see below a beautiful view of the lights of the city shining.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the county, real talent," he added.
The awards were given to the best tricks or maneuvers performed on the track.
After the event on Thursday afternoon, it will be snowing.
Still them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have called for the construction of minarets to be banned and there is a widespread warning about the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American scholar, has written a detailed and studied report on the possible integration of Muslims (who are actually integrating themselves) into one of the most lax societies in the world.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the author's latest work "Why the French Don't Like Headcarves" (2006), an elegant and detailed study of a problem that divided and concerned the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen’s latest book has a broader and more ambitious perspective.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide the five to six million Muslims in France what Mr. Bowen calls "Islamic spaces".
He is a good listener who reproduces debates between teachers and students about the questions that interest them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in a town hall (or both)?
Should they teach young Muslims about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it legitimate for a Muslim to use a interest-based banking system to obtain a mortgage?
It is these seemingly mundane issues, he argues, things of daily life, that concern the media more than political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of magnets, teachers and intellectuals, none of whom are renowned, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, an Arab academic and scholar born in Switzerland.
This new generation seeks to open the debate about how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen at the same time in a modern secular society.
They are not able to spread this argument completely.
Conservatives doubt only the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists Mr. Bowen interviewed tend to disagree with his Salafi counterparts, supporters of the Sunni Islam purist associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among Muslims in Europe.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But adaptation requires mutual concessions.
It questiones the extent to which French political strategists (and the intellectual elite who so ferociously defends secularism) are truly committed to pluralism.
It suggests that Muslims are likely to have more unfair treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make their historic commitments to secular republicanism.
More than a growing pragmatism, it perceives a “adjustment of values.”
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one tends to say, "Yes, but not yet."
The most desolating panorama in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other habitat on the planet.
The ice that defines it is melting at an alarming speed, bringing with it life that can’t survive anywhere else.
The interests of oil, gas, transport and fisheries have focused on newly opened waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors, as a result.
In "On Thin Ice", Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, paints a natural history of the northern icon, the polar bear.
Knowing the complicated history and policy of whale hunting, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers, who gave proof of their worth by facing the white bear.
The encounter of Admiral Nelson as a courageous 14-year-old cadet, struggling only with the end of his mosque, is certainly a myth, but others are true.
The boys, captured while swimming following the bodies of their newly exterminated mothers, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
A circus presentation in the early 20th century, exhibited 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even today, zoos enclosures are still generally a millionth of the area of a wild adult's area. The climate is almost never suitable: a polar bear residing in Singapore became green by the algae growing inside the hairless areas of its fur.

Ellis resorts to stories from other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, the United States and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter hunters and snowmobile squirrel Indians use high-power assault rifles to shoot down their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters north of those two hunting nations where the ice will last longer.
In his new book, "After the Ice", Alun Anderson, a former New Scientist editor, offers a clear and heartwarming account of the Arctic science and an overwhelming look at how the future of that place can be transformed.
Scientists don’t have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of changes.
It's not a lack of effort.
The pioneering journeys of Fridtjof Nansen in the late 19th and early 20th centuries gave for the first time clues about the movement of ice masses.
Then the Cold War submarines traced a map of the moving ice strands that circulate under the ice masses.
Satellite explorations and extensive series of iceberg-mounted probes are a useful supplement, but resistant individuals camped in the cold still perform many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looks inside the extraordinary, tiny world of the floating system inside the Arctic ice, formed by saltwater jets that compress while freezing.
But from the bear on the surface to the microscopic wonders inside, they are all doomed once summer ice is removed, which is believed to happen sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... these could be us
Marines among the 6,000 who place crowns in Arlington tombs
De'Angelo Robinson, 19, travelled seven hours by bus to put a single crown in the grave of a soldier he had never known.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, N.C., to the Arlington National Cemetery to decorate tombs, it was a day to pay tribute to men and women who once stood in their boots.
In a few months, from where they are embarking, these could be us, Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If it's us, I'd like someone to do the same for me, so I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered on Saturday morning to place crowns in the tombs of the veterans in several sections of the Arlington Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Worcester Crown Company in Harrington, Maine, initiated the event when he and others decided to decorate several hundred tombs at the Arlington Cemetery.
In what is already an 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the trip every year stopping in different cities along the way, to officiate events dedicated to military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has extended the event to other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns in the graves of Arlington Cemetery, areas in the Pentagon, graves at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, the Battery Park in New York City, and the United Airlines Flight 93 commemorative site in Shanksil.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation donated more than <0x24>150,000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said he made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a career military deceased.
While her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that this was his way of giving retribution to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way in which civilians can support our troops, he said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked through the wide meadows and hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers headed to older graves of World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam War, because they do not receive as many visits as the new graves, the organizers said.
The atmosphere was cheerful as the children played and the couples took their hands, while they carried the fresh pine to the gravestones.
Each circular crown was of a deep green, with a small red tie tied at the top.
Nearby, Section 60, where most of the veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars are buried, remained virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 crowns to decorate the section, but the dark atmosphere of the current wars invaded the area.
People cried openly, others prayed, and families and friends supported each other in the glacial air.
Some read out loud names carved on the stones, while others inclined to see small white and black plates placed inside the wet mud, for those whose stones have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who lick the tears of her eyes in front of her son’s grave.
He drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the grave of the Sgto naval artillery, David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free. . .my son paid for it, he said.
“A long time after my death, I want someone to remember it.”
Cuban officials arrest U.S. government contractor
The Cuban government has detained a U.S. government contractor distributing mobile and laptop computers in the country, State Department officials said on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., headquartered in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as the United States Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officers along with the U.S. Interest Section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested on December 5.
Specific charges have not been made public, although in accordance with Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be detained for almost anything deemed “dangerous”.
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including mild protests and critical writing, involve the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has an incipient blogger community, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has requested permission on several occasions to leave the country to accept prizes, but the permit has been denied.
The detention of an American contractor could likely provoke tensions between the Castro brothers’ communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been seeking a “slow-track” approach to improving relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to report the news of the arrest on Friday night.
The new US policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete measures, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for the opposition, there will be reciprocity on the part of the United States.
Mobile and laptop computers are legal in Cuba, although they are new and coveted products in a country where the average salary of a government worker is <0x24>15 a month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones only this year; they are mainly used for text messages, as a 15-minute phone conversation would cost the daily salary.
Internet usage is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign hotel visitors, and in some government establishments, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect, often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Gloria Berbena, a press officer at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, said most of the handful of U.S. citizens in prison in Cuba are among networks for crimes such as drug trafficking.
Berbena said she could not provide more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are clearly uncertain.
An activity that in any other open society would be legal, such as distributing free mobile phones, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the program for the Americas of the Human Rights Watch organization, which recently published a hard report on freedoms in Cuba, called "Nuevo Castro, Cuba's own brother," a reference to his being replaced by the mayor.
Vivanco said the defendants are often arrested, prosecuted and imprisoned in one day.
He pointed out that any solution would probably be political, and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries begin to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials unveil conspiracy to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities neutralized the alleged brain of a plot to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, saying they hope the case could help unravel an extensive network of terrorist recruiters, who are using the Internet in search of radicalized young people.
The investigators said they were chasing a mysterious insurgent figure, known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after discovering that one of them made comments by approving terrorist attacks on the YouTube video website.
Saifullah drove the men once they were in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan’s tribal belt, which is a familiar place for al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who had been informed about the case said on Saturday that Saifullah could not convince al-Qaeda commanders that the men were not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
Therefore, they were isolated for several days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the imposing mountains of the northwest, which have become a terrorist paradise.
They were considered part of a covert operation.
For this reason they were rejected, the official said, who spoke from anonymity due to the delicacy of the case.
The official said the men were not immutable and were even trying to get proper approval to access al-Qaeda camps when Pakistani police arrested them.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being interrogated by the FBI, underlines the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps most importantly, determining who they are.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, U.S. intelligence has given priority to trying to infiltrate people within al-Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as guards, not letting those who do not demonstrate a serious commitment to the holy war pass, and those who could be spies.
Analysts said al-Qaeda is looking at prospective American recruits with special attention.
But for the organization they represent a huge attraction, because of their potential to have access to American goals and because of their value of propaganda.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst for the U.S.-based NEFA Foundation, said terrorist groups have also become much more cautious about those they admit, because American intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you’re trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way to follow the recruitment model than how many have already followed?
It has become a much more web-based model.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demand climate action
On Saturday tens of thousands of protesters marched here on the streets demanding the negotiators working at the city’s Bella Center Convention Center, bolder actions for the climate.
Protesters said 100,000 people participated in the event, but police estimated the amount was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the city center.
On a day when little happened in the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked around the city holding banners in English that said “There is no planet B” and one in Spanish that declared, “Earth says “enough.”
Several celebrities joined the protest, including Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said Peru’s travels, her mother’s home country, made me aware of the distressing issues the country has to deal with due to the impacts of climate change that are already happening.
This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the great demonstration, to spread the word and appeal to the leaders of the world, to present a fair, ambitious and binding agreement.
This is not an easy task, but it has to be done, there is no way to avoid it for longer.
Police prevented protesters from getting too close to Bella Center, and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because of wearing masks or carrying pocket knives.
According to Danish law, those activities are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to a witness, who asked not to be identified for being involved in the climate talks, activists with sporting masks and black outfits placed several explosives near the main Copenhagen canal, which is close to several ministries.
They were by the buildings, he said, adding that they began as flames, but were followed by "a couple of big explosions."
Within the convention center, people gathered around the television screens to watch the march throughout the afternoon.
But the protest did not seem to penetrate the consciousness of key officials like Su Wei, China’s chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thought the demonstration was having a constructive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, “I wasn’t really aware of the situation.”
Then he went on to say in Mandarin, "how the meeting place is great, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He pointed out that it was up to each of us to determine whether the march was damaging or beneficial.
He said this shows the attention of the general public and of different sectors to the issue of climate change.
On the other hand, “it can also be said that they affect the negotiations, or the freedom of others.
Test Data Reveals Persistent Racial Differences
Last week’s federal math performance ratings booklet was very good news for the District Capital public schools.
Although the District is still far from the country’s best-performing systems, the rankings showed that fourth and eighth graders have jumped at a faster pace over the past two years, with respect to the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is recorded in the recent figures from the National Evaluation of Educational Progress is the persistent performance difference between African-American students and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average scores of D.C. fourth-grade white students over the past two years grew from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but their African-American peers only increased by three points, from 209 to 212.
Actually, the performance difference increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
Eighth-grade African Americans' progress remained essentially fixed, dropping a statistically insignificant point from 245 to 244.
The average scores of the whites were not included in the test results, because the sample size was not large enough.
Throughout a six-year extension, the picture is no longer encouraging.
The difference between white and black fourth-grade students in 2003, when the first ENPE in the District was announced, was 60 points from the scale (262 to 202).
Although the scores achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has barely decreased to 58.
Some District education lawyers expressed concern last week as the advances made by Rector Michelle A. El Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were largely driven by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the whole by addressing those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and conflicting, said Jeff Smith, executive director of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit organization advocating for educational equity in the District.
I’m not jumping in joy for a two or three-point difference, said D.C. Board member Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth grade of the Elemental Eaton.
Brown, an assiduous critic of Rhee’s administration style, said the message of the test scores is that the city’s secondary schools have a desperate need for attention.
Clearly, you always want to see the positive signs, and I respect them.
But what’s worrying is that we’re not dedicating the time or energy needed to our high schools.
Rhee said the District needs to continue to find better ways to address the needs of low-performance students.
This fall, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at high school students, who did not master the foundations of early reading in their school courses and are considerably behind their peers.
Everyday mathematics, a mathematics curriculum from kindergarten to sixth grade, which emphasizes real-life games and experiences, was introduced to the District under former Superintendent Clifford Janey, who is credited with some of the progress reported by ENPE last week.
I just think we have to keep working to offer the best interventions to those students who are below the degree level, Rhee said.
Others say the ENPE results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to increase the overall performance of the system and yet provide additional money and resources for low-performance schools, which will be needed to reduce the difference.
Here is a kind of scathing dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, an education professor at the University of California in Berkeley, who studies urban test scores.
The solution of conventional policy is to allocate its resources and administrative reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of D.C.
Then the goal can generate political repercussions that go against that important schedule.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other urban superintendents, she tries to cling to the black and white middle class.
Our focus is on ensuring that we build a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our barrier schools so that all families, regardless of where they live, have confidence that their children can access excellent public education.
Janey, now a superintendent of Newark schools, said in an interview this week that an essential element to end the performance gap is to extend the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the District, to compete with autonomous schools.
It has to come to nearly 200 days to have the strength of change, Janey said, who reached an agreement with her teachers' union last year in a year of 185 days, which she sees as an "indicator" to seek a greater increase in the next convention.
Making Higher Education a Part of More Futures
The tourist bus arrived at Gettysburg University with a strong resolve.
Graciela Rodríguez, 12, came down and blinked for a moment in front of the white columns, the brick facades and the emerald meadows.
Graciela’s parents had barely graduated from a secondary school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Still, when she and the group’s other 8th grade students explored Gettysburg, where the enrolment costs <0x24>38,690 a year, her attitude was less that of impressed guests than that of enthusiastic potential students.
This is where I will be! cried Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had entered the science building.
“Damn, seriously?” she said thoughtfully, when the guide spoke about the school’s low teacher-student ratio.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh children had visited on their three-day trip, and they had already completely absorbed their deliberate message: The question is not whether you’re going to university.
The question is which one.
While there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of Hispanic immigrants who leave high school or become pregnant in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands who access university education that they need to access the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these "second generation" Hispanics graduates from college, a remarkable achievement given that many of their immigrant parents, especially Mexicans and Central Americans, entered the United States without finishing high school.
Their success stories are important, the researchers say, because they indicate the way forward for a generation that will play a very important role in the country’s workforce.
Those analyzing the highest performance say they often have a natural affinity for school and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But tutoring programs can also play an exceptional role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college, especially if efforts are sustained in time.
Looking at low-income children, whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, it is deduced that any intervention at any time will not solve it, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has examined Latin students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the tour of Graciela universities is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than <0x24>300 million a year to local school systems, to run university preparatory programs, which start when low-income students are in high school and continue until they finish high school.
Since 1999, the program has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent attending the university, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
The Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum reaches agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its fragile infrastructure, during two auctions that concluded on Saturday.
The 10 agreements the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum reached with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are ready to play a leading role in the restoration of Iraq’s oil industry, mutilated by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies moved away having climbed into just two of the 10 sub-established sites.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only one who made an offer was lost.
Two U.S. companies reached agreements for underground settlements in June.
The poor representation of U.S. oil giants in the opening of Iraq’s oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, there are Asians and Europeans at the head, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news center.
It will take a long time before something else is on offer in Iraq.
Security concerns, heightened by mass coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as U.S. military withdrew, likely prevented U.S. oil companies from taking more risks in Iraq, which has the world’s third largest reserve of crude, analysts said.
U.S. companies were in some cases disadvantaged, because rivals, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, have considerably lower labor costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not respond to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to reach agreements with the ministry.
Major U.S. firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who have tightened ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum and have provided technical advice in recent years, have moved away with empty hands.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The National Oil Corporation, owned by the Chinese state, offered more contracts than any other company and made major investments in contracts for two major sites.
We know that China is on its way to becoming a major economic and technological power, said a spokesman for the Ministry of Petroleum, Assam Jihad.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be on top of its competitors and will fulfill its commitments to Iraq.
The companies pre-selected to submit proposals made bids which were then confronted with the barrel subsidy that the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above current levels in each site.
Al Qaeda’s main planner has apparently been killed in Pakistan.
An alleged U.S. missile attack on the Pakistan-Afghan border is believed to have killed a major al-Qaeda operations planner this week, U.S. counterterrorism officials said on Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on a high-ranking terrorist leader this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men thought to have died Tuesday when a pair of missiles hit his car near the city of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to US sources and Pakistani officials in the region.
Local authorities said the missiles were launched by an unidentified aircraft of the type operated by the CIA within the illegal tribal zone of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, a civil intelligence agency official in Pakistan said, speaking on the phone from Miran Shah.
The official said the suspected local militants rushed to the site and quickly confiscated what remained of the “totally destroyed bodies.”
Local authorities were unable to verify the victims' identities, but two U.S. counterterrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as a high-ranking al-Qaeda military planner, who directed terrorist group operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was committed to conspiracy around the world, a senior official said, who spoke from anonymity, citing the delicate nature of U.S. airstrikes within Pakistani territory.
Considering its central role, this probably included conspiracy attacks against the United States and Europe.
He had a strategic guide from al-Qaeda’s top command and translated it into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said Somali had quickly risen to the ranks of al Qaeda and was well connected with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a name known to some Americans, but that does not diminish in any way the threat that it posed to us and our allies, the second official said.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second al Qaeda leader or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal zone, and three other high-ranking agents.
The pace of CIA-led drone strikes has declined since the summer, from an average of about six operations a month to two, according to a count of The Long War Journal, a nonprofit-led website.
The decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups, who have taken measures to limit their vulnerability while ruthlessly killing suspected informants, the site said.
U.N. summit in Kabul to resign
U.N. top envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday he would resign in March, ending a tumultuous mandate that was hampered by widespread corruption allegations in Afghanistan’s UN-backed presidential election.
Eide’s departure comes when the Obama administration has decided to send some 30,000 additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The U.N. envoy said it supports the increase, but is concerned that the U.S. military withdrawal schedule that begins in 18 months is pushing other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the preparation of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans so they can trust the international community, Eide said in a phone interview from Kabul.
Commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civil servants, who cooperate with the political transition of Afghanistan.
The increase in the military sector must be reflected in the civilian sector, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008, to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to notify the secretary.
UN General Ban Ki-moon, so he had time to find a replacement.
What I’ve said is that it’s best they start looking for a successor, said Eide.
When I arrived here, there was a two-month gap between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has begun seeking a replacement, according to UN officials.
Officials say they have been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian citizen who recently headed the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously headed UN peacekeeping missions.
Eide’s position in Afghanistan was put to the test before his former delegate, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country’s presidential vote and covering evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the indictments, but said Galbraith’s allegations, who was fired, “surely harmed the mission, because there was already a lot of skepticism about international interference” in the election.
Eide said he proposed the appointment of a high civil representative to coordinate assistance efforts by the US-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also pushed the UN leadership to allow its successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries, which lend themselves to the Afghan mission, saying this would increase their confidence that their money is being used correctly.
Eide expressed frustration at the limitations to his powers in Afghanistan, claiming that heavier UN hiring regulations undermined his ability to capture talent.
That’s how the UN rules allowed me to recruit only one person since May, he said.
That is catastrophic and cannot continue.
Gates: Iran to Face Additional Sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" against Iran, for failing to set up talks on its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, addressing a group of about 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq, during a week-long trip to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, remained important to the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier’s question about the likelihood of such an event.
One of the things that weighs on me is that if we have learned something about Iraq over the past six years, it is the inherent unpredictability of the war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions targeting Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates noted that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian population as a whole.
He argued that it would be necessary "a package of incentives and disincentives," "to persuade the Iranian government that they would really be less secure with nuclear weapons," because "their people will suffer enormously" the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement from White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders to warn that Iran will face "credible" consequences if its nuclear program fails to fully comply with the instructions of the UN Security Council and its nuclear control body, the International Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on 1 October, he said he would renegotiate the restriction of his nuclear program and agree to leave a substantial portion of his enriched uranium reserve in exchange for the fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for such an agreement, as a way to build trust between the two parties and save time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to have turned away from the attempted agreements, in part, experts claim, because the Iranian command is divided in relation to the possibility of compromising with the United States.
“I think that Iran’s hardening with the international community on some proposals that they actually accepted in early October has united the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way that they have not been in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians,” Gates said.
President Obama has set a deadline on December 31 for Iran to respond to proposals before rethinking other options, including proceeding with what Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “destroying sanctions.”
In a statement made in New York, Iran’s mission to the United Nations denounced what it called Thursday “unfounded and unfounded accusations” by some members of the Security Council about Iran’s nuclear activities, and said it is only willing to continue talks with the United States, a long-awaited, five-strength, global goal to achieve.
Gates, who was returning to Washington last Friday, met Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region of Iraq, to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions continue to rise between the Kurds and the Arab majority of Iraq, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and co-participation.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for the conflict, to avoid any delay in U.S. projects, to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to alleviate Kurdish anxiety about the pending reduction, and US officials quoted Gates as saying to Massoud Barzani, the president of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve their security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not abandon them.”
In an ageing China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that sermoned them about the fact that "Mother Earth is too tired to support more children" and "one more baby means one more grave."
They learned the lesson so well that, when government officials in Shanghai, alarmed by the low birth rate and the aging population of their city, suddenly changed course this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child, their reaction was instantaneous and firm.
We have already given all our time and energy only to a child.
We have nothing left for a second, said Wang, 31, a human resource manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the single-child policy was introduced in China, creating two generations of notoriously crooked, malcried single-children, affectionately nicknamed “small emperors,” a demographic crisis is emerging in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen by 1.8 children per couple, compared to the six when the policy became effective, according to the Division.
UN demographic, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is projected to explode from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent by 2050. This is well above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is worse in coastal cities rich with very cult populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for almost 22 percent of registered residents in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Commission on Family Planning and Municipal Population, said fertile couples should have babies to “help reduce the proportion of the aging population and mitigate a future labour shortage.”
Shanghai is about to be “so old (not as rich, however) as developed countries like Japan and Sweden,” he said.
A gradual relief
Drafted in the country's constitution in 1978, China's single-child policy is possibly the most controversial mandate introduced to date by the Communist Party.
Couples who violate politics face huge fines, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and labour discrimination.
Chinese officials have endorsed the policy for their contribution to avoid critical pressure on their natural resources, while human rights defenders have denounced abuses in the imposition of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples have made abortions according to the sex of the fetus, leading to a high unnatural male-female ratio.
In recent years, demographic officials have gradually softened their stance on single-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities, and cases in which both husband and wife are single children, and in 2007 they attenuated many of their hardline slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Beijing University Institute of Demographic Research, said central government officials have recently been debating even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the spouses is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost at night in the morning, posters ordering families to have one child were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who would be eligible to have a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city’s government sent family planning officials and volunteers to visit couples at their homes and slide brochures under the doors.
It has also promised to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say the response has been very little overwhelming.
Disappointing response
Although officials in a rural city in the outskirts of Shanghai maintain that they observed a moderate increase in requests for couples who want a second child after the campaign launch, the most urban districts do not indicate any change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five applications per month.
Disappointed officials in Shanghai say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still projected to only reach around 165,000, slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of Caolu municipality in Shanghai, said financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don’t want more children.
They want to give their best to their first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally qualified to do so.
But like many Chinese, they have only insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a social protection network, they argue, that option would be irresponsible.
People in the West incorrectly see single-child politics as a matter of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple’s first child.
Yes, they are robbing us of the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political issue.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the human resource manager, said she wants a unique son because she was also: “We were the center of our families and we were used to being taken care of by everyone.
We’re not used to taking care of others and we really don’t want to take care of others.”
Chen Zijian, 42, the owner of a translation agency, explained it more strongly.
For parents with two middle-class careers, which reduce the birth rate, he said, it is about having enough success to be selfish.
People between the ages of 20 and 30 grew up watching their parents fight during the first days of China’s experiment with capitalism and they don’t want that kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child requires a lot of time from parents, he said.
A mother has to give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space issues, “you have to remodel your apartment,” and the strategist “must have a curriculum prepared for the best kindergartens when the child is 9 months old.”
Most of his friends are willing to face this once, Chen said, but not two.
Ours is the first generation with the highest standard of living, he said.
We don’t want to make too many sacrifices.
UN Group Draws Plan to Reduce Emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference, so far characterized by challenging stances and mutual recriminations, caught renewed attention on Friday with the release of a document that provides for ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations carrying the bulk of their shoulders on their shoulders.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the way forward.
But it was seen as a major breakthrough in a timeless negotiation, with more than 100 world leaders arriving in Copenhagen next week.
Developed by an ad hoc UN working group, the text does not mention how much money rich countries would give to poor people to face short- and long-term global warming.
And this offers a variety of options for key questions, including how developed economies and major emerging economies would cut their coal production, and what would be the limit of the global temperature rise that political strategists would be willing to tolerate.
This gives a lot of flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, senior representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the top UN climate official, Yvo de Boer, described as "the great panorama."
It shows the profiles for a possible deal, in which industrialized nations would collectively cut their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries would reduce their emissions during the same period by 15 to 30 percent.
Together, countries would cut emissions between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also spurred talks on Friday, promising to provide <0x24>3.6 billion annually over the next three years, to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
Anyway, on Friday, the same kind of verbal fireworks that have dominated the conversations last week were presented.
U.S. special climate envoy Todd Stern has rejected claims that require mandatory cuts in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialized countries, compared to volunteers from major emerging economies, if they were not funded by the developed world.
The maneuver indicated that the Obama administration is adopting a tougher line with China, with respect to what Bush administration officials did just two years ago.
The United States will not make an agreement without the major developing countries advancing and taking action, Stern said, who also regretted that the text did not do enough to ensure the cuts could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his remarks an hour after Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei said the top U.S. climate negotiator lacked “common sense,” or was “very irresponsible” for saying earlier this week that the U.S. would not help China economically cope with global warming.
With the future economic trajectory of the world’s major powers at stake, the failure lines have erupted both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is both to save individual economies and to save the planet, with China and the United States facing their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the twenty-four most influential countries in the world are ignoring the scientific imperative to take the most courageous action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it’s not surprising that major powers are discussing who should cost spending to limit greenhouse gas emissions, even though vulnerable countries have become more aggressive in seeking to contain the major emitters responsible for their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is being developed, said Ulate, who also works as a regional advisor on climate change in Mexico and Central America, for International Conservation.
Some of the most vulnerable countries to the impact of climate change indicated they would continue to press for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the main participants say the talks will at most produce a political agreement.
The Small Island States Alliance, which has 43 members, drafted a 24-page preliminary treaty proposal early on Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said the push for small island nations "has put political pressure on the entire political process," in part because they are now unified and demand the action of emerging economies such as China and India.
The talks took on a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they must resolve most of the exceptional issues before heads of government reach a deal.
High-level officials, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Deputy Minister, descended from the planes and ran to the halls of the Bella Center, to closed-door meetings and press conferences, to be able to delineate claims that will be arbitrated over the next week.
The absolute mess of the meeting (where every day 13,000 people enter and leave the convention center, the activists who play the guitar present night shows mocking the countries that they believe are being sold, and preliminary proposals are being made hand in hand rather than by mail) poses a challenge.
Intensity only builds: Almost all key ministers are here right now, and on Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the major leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, vice president for global international conservation policy.
Heavy weights are coming.
The first train at 225 kmh from Britain redefines Monday’s feeling
At 5.13 a.m. on Monday morning, a whirlwind will pierce the darkness to signal a train departure that marks a revolution for travel in Britain.
The country’s first high-speed intercity train will reach 225 km/h when it passes as a beam from Ashford, Kent, to St Panrcas Station in London, covering 93 kilometers in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Secretary of Transport, will join Lady Kelly Holmes on board the first intercity Javelin service outside London.
He hopes that the new service will finally connect Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the major Midlands, North and Scotland cities to London.
The neglected remote areas would become prosperous suburbs, business travel times would be shortened, and the change of planes and cars to rail would reduce domestic carbon emissions, as well as alleviate congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable battle of planning and fears of environmental damage, can still slow Britain’s high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to provide the government with a feasibility study, will deliver its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, the Times reported.
This will provide you with a detailed itinerary of the next planned step for the high-speed network.
The new line connecting London to the West Midlands will be drawn within a five-meter radius in urban areas and areas where the environmental impact can be controversial.
In rural areas, the plan will be drawn within a 25-meter radius of a definitive route.
HS2 is also expected to establish three options for a wider high-speed network heading north.
Lord Adonis will respond in spring.
The preferred option being proposed is a Y-shaped configuration, in which a single high-speed line would reach the West Midlands.
The line would be divided into or near Birmingham, with one branch heading west from the Peninsula to Manchester and Scotland, and another northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would enter Scotland.
"It seems this will be the most beneficial option," said a member of the railway.
Once completed, travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first section, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to just over an hour’s current time.
The proposals would allow trains to travel at 402 km/h, making the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial track is designed to support 400-meter-long trains, capable of carrying 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate every hour on a London-Birmingham line.
This means that a London terminal capable of receiving 20,000 passengers per hour would be needed.
Considering the capital’s space restrictions, an existing station is expected to be expanded to fit the high-speed network.
Railway industry experts argue that only the St Pancras International or Euston station offers that potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he believes the scheme should proceed, but a broad public consultation and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be made until after a general election.
Even if you start the work, the network would have to be built in sections.
At first, trains would be forced to leave the high-speed lines on existing rails north of Birmingham, keeping travel times between London and Scotland above three hours.
This is considered as the crucial point necessary to ensure a change of planes to trains, a reference point for the railway revolution.
Taxpayers face mortgage for <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 from a Conservative
Alan Duncan, a spokesman for the Conservative Party, lent the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orange she built in the house of her constituency.
The party's prison spokesman, who was degraded by David Cameron for complaining that MPs lived "of rations", raised his mortgage by <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 to build an extension framed in oak in his second home in Rutland.
They allowed the taxpayer to charge the additional interest, adding hundreds of pounds a month.
Authorities in the House of Commons approved the requests at the time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who is conducting a review of members' expenses. Last night Mr Duncan said the requests "could not be clearer or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest Members of Parliament, owns a two-story house in a village in his electoral district of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have been sold for almost a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the fee office agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a greenhouse to the house, described in the plans as an "orange".
Neighbors described it as “a greenhouse for entertainment.”
Mr. Duncan was not asked to make any reference to the increase in the loan, during a recent investigation by the House of Commons Committee on Standards and Privileges on his previous mortgage agreements.
Last month, the committee absolved him of breaking the rules, following an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal guarantee for a <0xC2><0xA3>271,406 mortgage from his London property to the house in his constituency, which he had bought in 1991, the year before he became a deputy.
Documents released this week show that Mr. Duncan was applying for approximately 1,400 pounds per month in mortgage interest, until March last year.
In April, their requests increased to over <0xC2><0xA3>1,800 a month.
The interest rate on Mr. Duncan's Royal Bank of Scotland mortgage remained unchanged at the time, suggesting that the entire increase would finance the <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 loan.
The standard variable mortgage rate of BRE fell from 7.94% in December 2007 to 4% in March this year, the rate it is now.
The most recent document issued by the House of Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to request <0xC2><0xA3>1,250 per month in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his job as president of the opposition House in September, after a covert reporter filmed him saying MPs had to survive "race" after the spending scandal.
"Basically this is being nationalized, you have to live from rations and be treated like a m**rda."
He said: “I spend my money in my garden and request a small fraction based on what is appropriate.
And I could ask for much more, but I don’t.”
The deputy, a millionaire for his former profession as an oil merchant, was first questioned about his spending in May, when it turned out that he had asked for thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the salaries office that this could “be considered excessive.”
An activist drilled a pound-shaped symbol hole in Mr. Duncan’s lawn as a protest after it was revealed that he demanded 4,000 pounds for three years.
Last night, when asked about the increase in the mortgage, Mr. Duncan said, "It was for primary improvements, approved both by the salary office and later by Legg."
He added: “It’s not about avoiding and criminalizing or breaking the rules or whatever.
This is absolutely within the limits, according to the rules, authorized and everything.
It couldn’t be in any way clearer or simpler.”
Come those who have faith, to see the calendar of the Brighton Beach Palapa Event
Brighton’s pallets have found a new impetus for the winter months on an interactive Event calendar.
In addition, an alternative religious group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their palates for each December day, using villains as their theme.
The event began on December 1, with guests who could see the last paw from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, with packed pastilles and free ponches served.
The villains chosen so far include Vi Tres Barcos, Oh Ven, Oh Ven, Emanuel, and The First Christmas, where the pallapa presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a Hove TV marketing assistant, is an unpaid clergyman from the Diocese of Chichester and the leader of Beyond.
He said: “We want religion to be more relevant to people in a post-Christian society.”
“Why do we as a Church expect people to come to an old, strange building? I think the Church should come to people and celebrate in exciting ways.
“The idea of the event calendar began as a conversation with some friends during a dinner.
Brighton is an incredibly creative and vibrant place and we’re trying to prove and represent that through spirituality.”
Massive climate mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world
Tens of thousands of protesters on Saturday called for an ambitious and binding deal to fight global warming, worldwide and in Copenhagen, where police arrested several hundred people.
Some 30,000 people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, marched through the frozen Danish capital in demand for an agreement that the United Nations Climate Change Conference should reach no later than Friday, which would come into force on January 1, 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Denmark’s president of the climate conference, the growing global climate mobilization, represented by these demonstrations, contributed to making the “political price” of a failure in Copenhagen very high.
The incidents erupted shortly after the start of the demonstration in the Danish capital, when a group of 300 people, all dressed in black, broke shelves with skulls and hammers, an AFP reporter reported.
The anti-disturbance police intervened quickly and firmly.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people in total, she said, especially members of the “Black Blocks”, ultra-violent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, last April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of militants were detained “without distinctions,” stressing that one hundred of them “were immobilized on the street on Saturday nights and sat down despite the intense cold.”
The demonstration, quite peaceful, left Parliament and took to the Bella Center, the headquarters of the negotiations.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without attempting to enter.
The former South African archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a candle-watch.
Most of the protesters arrived by bus and train from major European cities, but many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most with celestial rainbows, responded by forming a first concentration in the morning in Copenhagen to the Friends of the Earth call to form “blue tides” for “justice and climate.”
Today we take the streets to ask for compensation for the ecological debt in favour of the South, Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino militant from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen, explained.
We cannot continue to say: there is time, said the Benedictine singer Angélique Kidjo.
In Africa, there are dried rivers, watercourses that you can walk through like never before could have been done.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, created in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement approached ecological organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure in anti-globalization, explained that he came to Copenhagen to "unite climate justice and social justice": "Today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the fight for another world."
The Asia-Pacific region, which brings together numerous islands very vulnerable to warming, gave the initial tipping point to the demonstrations.
According to the organizers, about 50,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, more than a hundred people, mostly students, marched in red dresses and wearing diapers with slogans in favor of solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, as well as in Canada, concentrations of hundreds of protesters were formed claiming to act vigorously against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the network "350" gathered hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
There were dozens of people in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia elected president, although Georgia denounces "fraud"
On Saturday, Abkhazia, a pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia recognized by Moscow more than a year ago, elected president; however, Tbilisi denounces "fraud".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russo-Georgian War in August 2008 by control of South Ossetia, another Georgian separatist region recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 5 p.m. GMT.
According to officials of the Abkhazia Electoral Commission, participation was 58% hours before closing.
The first provisional results would be announced on the evening of Saturday to Sunday.
The five running candidates, including the outgoing president, Sergueï Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which rejected the scrutiny of votes.
These elections are a farce.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili “lamented that Abkhazia had fallen under the total Russian occupation,” his spokeswoman, Manana Manjgaladzé, said.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After his separation from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict that ended with several thousand deaths, Abkhazia tries to demonstrate through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, our new era as an independent state, Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claimed to have voted for Bagapch, told AFP.
She was among the voters who headed to the polling station at a school in the capital, Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with palm trees at the entrance.
The theme of Russian domination is the central theme of the presidential election in this region with sumptuous landscapes, on the banks of the Black Sea.
Large panels show Bagapch alongside the Russian president and prime minister, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, in different places in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, to the west of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, warmly welcomed the Russian officials who came to control the development of scrutiny.
In a brief ceremony, he said: We, the people of Abkhazia, are grateful for the support of Moscow, and in particular, for the decision to recognize Abkhazia’s independence.
I hope his country will be quickly recognized by the United Nations, replied Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, lifting his vodka glass.
The opposition, represented in the election by former Vice President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticized the agreements signed with Moscow last year, such as the one that ceded control of the Abkhazian railways to Russia for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, claims that he does not support the current power or opposition.
A 50% majority plus a vote is needed to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round will be organized two weeks later.
Climate: world demonstrations, incidents in Copenhagen
On Saturday, tens of thousands of people took to the streets of the world to demand an ambitious and binding deal before the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference, where police, on alert, arrested more than 700 people around an imposing demonstration.
Some 30,000 people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, marched in the afternoon in the cold of the Danish capital, which until December 18 hosts delegates from 193 countries, in search of an agreement to enter into force on January 1, 2013.
The demonstration, quite peaceful, left Parliament and took to the Bella Center, where negotiations take place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center, without attempting to enter.
The former South African archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a candle-watch.
Moments after the start of the demonstration, a group of hundreds of people, all dressed in black, broke windows with bricks and hammers, an AFP reporter reported.
The riot police quickly surrounded them and intervened firmly, dragging several of them on the floor.
Police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, stating that they were mainly members of the “Black Blocks”, ultraviolet groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, last April.
In the late afternoon, a police officer was wounded in the jaw with a skull, and four cars were burned near an occupied house during the incidents that led to the arrest of about twenty people, according to police.
We did not take our eyes off extremist groups, said police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen, as the helicopters of the law enforcement were flying over the area.
Most of the protesters, who arrived by bus and train from the major cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam, even Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were present as well as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most with celestial rainbows, responded by forming a first concentration in the morning in Copenhagen to the Friends of the Earth call to form “blue tides” for “justice and climate.”
Today we take the streets to ask for compensation for the ecological debt in favour of the South, Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino militant from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen, explained.

French MEP José Bové, a figure in anti-globalization, told AFP that he came to Copenhagen to "unite climate justice and social justice": "Today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the fight for another world."
The Oxfam organization, along with former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, who was supposed to lead the crowd, mobilized several celebrities, including Danish model Helena Christensen.
The Asia-Pacific region, which brings together numerous islands very vulnerable to warming, gave the initial tipping point to the demonstrations.
According to the organizers, about 5,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, hundreds of people, mostly students, protested in red dresses and sketches with slogans in favor of solar energy in front of the Philippine capital city hall.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, concentrations of hundreds of protesters were formed claiming to act against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the network "350" gathered hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).

The subject of history and geography emerges reinforced from the reform of secondary education, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education, Luc Chatel, said in an interview that will be broadcast in Sunday's Newspaper (JDD) that history and geography would be "fortified" from the reform of general secondary education, despite being removed from compulsory education in the second year of high school.
From now on, all undergraduate students will have four hours a week and the same program for a shared culture, Chatel says.
For the Minister, "stop the hypocrisy" because, according to him, "the branch C is no longer a scientific branch", but "in general, it calls for the best students".
The branches of General Teaching and Literary cannot be sub-ramas of the C, he goes on to stress even: “I have not heard that historians or intellectuals were outraged at having eliminated history and geography in high school technology.”
An IFOP poll published on Saturday in L’Humanité revealed that about seven out of ten (69 percent) French people rejected the government’s plan to eliminate compulsory history-geography teaching in secondary school C. Numerous intellectuals and lecturers, the left and some critics of the electorate.
Instead, the Minister added that "there is no talk" of removing philosophy from the C-secondary program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and unions) convened a mobilization day on Tuesday to protest against the project, which they say is sacrificing the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year they will make an admission test that will aim at their discipline, and at the end of the year, an admission test on their ability to teach, the minister explained.
They will also do internships in real conditions during the M2 year, after which they will be a first year in front of the classroom as teachers in internships.
If you do all the proposed practices before the contest, you will already have a great experience in front of the classroom, that is, more than 300 hours, he added.
Finally, the Minister notes that he will propose "the individual right to education, which does not exist in national education".
He also confirmed the plan to remove the school map "before 2012".
At the Normal High School, experts will have 15 minutes to convincingly explain climate evolution
Fifteen minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen summit, a challenge he accepted on Saturday morning Jean Jouzel, vice-president of the Intergovernmental Panel of Experts on Climate Evolution (GIEC) invited by the Ulm Street Normal High School.
Jean Jouzel, also Nobel Peace Prize laureate, inaugurated the Ernest conference wheel, a day consisting of a series of 15-minute expert presentations, filmed and open to the public, an AFP reporter reported.
We wanted to do something that attracts people and convey to them the desire to know more, explained 22-year-old Edouard Hannezzo, one of the organizers of this day called as the students christened the fish in the school’s pond.
We selected about twenty participants from the experts in their discipline and selected them for their charismatic side, he said.
About global warming, "we can talk about hours, but we can also talk about key targets in a few minutes," Jean Jouzel, who exposed without notes, but with the help of graphics in front of about fifty people, told AFP.
It is part of our scientific role, he stressed, expecting the public to understand that “the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific dossier.”
The videos filmed during those conferences will be online on the school’s website from December 15.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bi-monthly rate.
Delay in payments: dislike among prison guards, action is planned
Prison guard unions called on Friday for a “general mobilization” to demand payment before the end-of-year festivities, premiums and overtime, which was postponed until further budgetary reasons.
The Penitentiary Workers’ Force (Second Guards Union) called on out-of-service staff to join the demonstration on Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and “block them” to denounce the theft of their haters.
The CGT penitentiary (3rd syndicate of the profession) calls them to "meet in general assemblies in different prisons to achieve mass mobilization", since it calls "shameful and unacceptable" the non-compliance of the payment in December of the "overtimes, night premiums, Sundays and public holidays."
And the first guard union, the Federal Autonomous Penitentiary Union (UFAP/UNA), "convokes general mobilization (...) in order to increase discontent and fury".
The Directorate of the Penitentiary Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime increased significantly in 2009 and not all were accounted for, but they assure that the balance will be paid in January.
At the last hour of the day, the Chancellor reported that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the guard unions guaranteeing that the payment would be made next month.
I have no doubt about the efforts made by staff for the functioning and modernization of our prison system, writes the Minister of Justice in this letter.
I asked the Directorate of the Penitentiary Administration to implement immediately a set of measures to ensure that this situation generated by a poor assessment of the number of overtimes does not occur again in the future.
The December pay will then be scarce, except for the management staff who enjoys the benefits of the famous premiums for functions and goals, and who “always blames budget requirements,” Ufap/UNA said.
It is a real scandal, the FO inter-regional union of Marseille said indignant, announcing its decision to boycott to new order "all meetings and convocations".
Staff will not come to work on the corresponding Sundays and holidays if those of the month of October are not paid in December, the same will happen with the overtime, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when our tasks and missions are increasing without taking more staff, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the salaries of staff, according to the Bordeos Penitentiary CGT.
According to the unions, not all regions do the same, as some have more luck than others.
But anyway, the result is not the expected, Ufap general secretary Jean-François Forget said.
For Christmas, Obama Says He Makes “Best Gifts” Than He Receives
U.S. President Barack Obama, who will celebrate his first Christmas with his family in the White House, confessed to famous television presenter Oprah Winfrey, who came to a simple conclusion as to the gifts: “I have better gifts than those I receive.”
During a special interview that ABC will broadcast on Sunday night, the President and his wife Michelle explain how they plan to celebrate the holidays at the end of the year in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the small four-legged companion of the family, will be in the game.
Santa also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, clarifying that the dog will "of course" receive a gift, according to the extras of the program transmitted in advance.
And Michelle Obama disagreed with her husband’s statements about the quality of the gifts she receives: “In no way, last year I made you beautiful gifts,” she said provoking the president.
True, he was forced to admit it before responding humorously pointing to the First Lady's pearl necklace: "Who gave you that?"
During the one-hour interview, in a relaxed atmosphere with the famous animator who devotedly supported Barack Obama’s presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite childhood gifts.
Barack Obama recalled a two-speed bike, as well as a basketball that his Kenyan father, who seldom saw, gave him for Christmas.
I remember that time when my dad came to see us at Christmas and gave me a basketball, the president said.
Only a few years later, I learned that he had given me that ball.
On the other hand, the First Lady remembered her house of dolls.
I had no idea how to arrange a house, so I put all the furniture online against the wall, instead of accommodating them around the house, however, I loved that house of dolls, Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday Re-Operated, RTL Says He's Induced in Coma
Johnny Hallyday was once again intervened in Los Angeles due to major "injury" resulting from an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his relatives, while RTL claims the singer was subjected to a coma induced to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was once again intervened on the night of Wednesday to Thursday at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles where some doctors checked for "injury derived from the surgery" of disc hernia performed in Paris on November 26, his press service in that same city said, indicating that such injuries "re-opened".
However, the singer's press service tried to convey peace of mind stating that the situation was "under control", and reported that a new medical party would communicate within the next 48 hours.
According to RTL, sponsor of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday agreed, however, to be subjected to a coma induced to avoid "pain and complications".
In less than 48 hours when the patient wakes up, we will have more certainty about his condition, RTL adds.
The press service, questioned by AFP, did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that "according to some sources" no cannula would have been introduced after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated on in the international clinic of Monceau Park due to a disc hernia.
The intervention, scheduled for a few days ago, was practiced by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known physician in the artistic environment.
On Thursday night, Delajoux refused to comment on the information transmitted by RTL.
Singer Johnny Hollyday entered the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles on Monday for an infection derived from Delajoux’s intervention.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, an intimate friend of Johnny Hallyday, explained on RTL Thursday that his friend was going through “a bad time,” but said there was “no problem” because the rocker is “a fighter.”
He called me just before he travelled to Los Angeles, and I told him it was a nonsense to get 12 hours on a plane after such an operation, it is not possible, said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday night, the musician's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, sought to calm down, saying Johnny Hallyday was "satisfactory to antibiotics" and that the infection was "controlled".
Camus said he had spoken to Laeticia, the musician's wife, and had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer’s health problems have multiplied since July when he was incarcerated for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to general surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed that he had been operated on a "colon cancer", after a slight infection.
In late September, the singer resumed, as expected, his long "Gira 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been overly commented on, and fanatics and journalists have noticed the musician’s difficulty in moving on stage.
In mid-November, his relatives even had to deny a new internation.
Euro-2009/short pool: first Bousquet title in his favorite distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, triple medalist at the 2009 long-swimming world cup, won an international title on Thursday at a distance for which he feels particular affection, 50 m free, during Euro-2009 in a short-swimming pool in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition in which polyurethane bathers were allowed for the last time, only three world records were exceeded when many more were actually expected.
One was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto in 200 m 4 styles; and the other two, by the Russian in relief 4 x 50 m 4 styles (male).
A penalty for Bousquet, who wanted the world record in 50 m free, brand that owns a long swimming pool (20.94).
In one of the two queen distances of swimming, in 50 m free, the 28-year-old Frenchman was forced to 20''53 during a final where ten swimmers competed instead of eight as usual, an international premiere.
Bousquet advanced Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to lower the world mark (20.30), as planned.
We can always aspire to something better and, in that case, I already said that if the world record was at my fingertips, I would try to achieve it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore polyurethane bathtubs that will be banned from January 1.
These swimmers, which have held 238 world records since February 2008, finish their epic work in Istanbul, where they competed for the first time in 1999 for the same test.
This time the use of bathers did not help German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in long pool this summer in Rome, consecutive world records.
The young swimmer failed to lower his mark in 400 m free (3:32.77), however, he was forced with the second best time of his career (3:34.55), against Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn’t give up in this race.
I knew I was not going to be able to beat a world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and fulfill my mission.
Lobintsev will be a tough rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
U.S.: Zola-owned sarcophagus panel sold for <0x24>1.5 million
A panel of Roman sarcophagus belonging to French writer Emile Zola was sold for <0x24>1.5 million on Thursday, well above the estimated price, Sotheby’s art walker announced.
This 2-meter-long panel by 63 cm-high, dating from the 3rd century BC, and its price had been estimated between <0x24>150,000 and <0x24>250,000.
The marble "representing four dionisiac scenes, in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satire and drunken women, is a rare piece, as there are only four or five in the world," Florent Heintz, vice president of art auctions in ancient Rome and Soby's Egyptian capital, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold among a hundred lots.
Sales continue, but so far, this batch was the most auctioned by buyers, no doubt, told AFP a Sotheby's spokesman, Dan Abernethy.
Only a few days ago, it was discovered that the marble was an acquisition of Emile Zola.
For almost 300 years, the panel was part of the famous collection of the Borges family in Rome, then appeared successively in the house of French actress Cécile Sorel, as an element of her bathtub in her particular Parisian mansion, and in the house of Paul Raynaud, minister of the Third French Republic and president of the Council for a short time.
For about fifty years, his whereabouts were uncertain.
Reviewing the Louvre database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of a "Emile Zola succession" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the "Rougon-Macquart" fresco.
Honduras Aborts Zelaya's Exit to Mexico
On Thursday, Mexico estimated that conditions were not given to transfer to its territory to the overthrown President of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, to whom the coup government denied the bailout.
At the moment, after a phone conversation at night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that there is no possibility of the move, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
The Mexican government plane that arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday to take off to Zelaya returned to its place of origin, according to a source from the Directorate-General for Migration.
To grant him a bailout, the coup government wanted to force Zelaya to “resign” and ask for political asylum abroad.
But the overthrown president refused because he wanted to arrive in Mexico as Head of State in guest exercise.
The coup d’état “has suffered a new defeat by asking me to resign from my position (...), they wanted me to present my resignation,” Zelaya told Globo Radio on Thursday, in which he often makes statements since the beginning of the five-month-long political crisis in the Central American country.
Here I can stay ten years, I have my guitar, added the deposed president, who has been a refugee in the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Mexican embassy presented us with a request for bailout, but unfortunately we could not accept it for not containing an asylum request, the Interior Minister of the Golpista government, Oscar Raúl Matute, told Honduras radio HRN on Wednesday.
“I will not ask for asylum in any country,” Zelaya said in an interview with Telesur, headquartered in Caracas.
If I leave Honduras, I will do it as president of the Honduran people, he stressed.
Rumors about Zelaya’s departure mobilized on Wednesday supporters of the deposed president, who gathered around the Brazilian embassy, heavily besieged by the military.
The Brazilian Foreign Minister, Celso Amorim, criticized the government’s position.
This reflects the marginal character of this government against international standards, he estimated.
Zelaya, who had approached Venezuela’s socialist president Hugo Chávez, was overthrown on June 28, the day he had organized a referendum to prepare for his re-election, rejected by the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
Since his exile in Costa Rica, he returned surprisingly on September 21 and took refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested and will have to respond to justice for the crime of “high treason,” according to the coup government.
The de facto president, Roberto Micheletti, managed to hold a presidential election on November 29 to replace Zelaya.
In the controversial scrutiny, Porfirio Lobo was elected. This election was recognized by the United States, but questioned by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress massively voted against Zelaya’s return to power until his term ended on January 27.
Wall Street rises, U.S. trade balance fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed up on Thursday, U.S. trade balance figures are faithful witness to both the U.S. and its partners’ economic reactivation: the Dow Jones won 0.67%; and the Nasdaq, 0.33%.
According to the final figures at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, and the Nasdaq, a technological component, 7.13 points to 2190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 expanded index rose 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
We receive good news from different sectors of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But this is anecdotal, he clarified, considering that the market was concentrated "in the half-full glass".
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors focused primarily on U.S. trade balance figures, “reflecting an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter.”
The U.S. trade deficit fell 7.6% in October compared to September, to <0x24>32.9 billion.
Analysts, on the contrary, expected a deepening of the deficit.
Both imports and exports increased.
The big news is the growth in trade volumes, particularly exports of goods, which reflect the growth of major economies trading with the United States, said Christopher Cornell, of the research firm Economy.com.
In contrast, last week, unemployment registrations in the United States increased unexpectedly, with 474,000 applications being submitted.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers "was the lowest in a year," said Scott Marcouiller, of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury Bond rose to 3.482% versus 3.423 percent on Tuesday night, and the 30-year Bond to 4.492% versus 4.408% on the eve.
Cuba: More than a hundred supporters of power abuse the "Ladies of White"
On Thursday, hundreds of Cuban power supporters abused the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day and prevented another demonstration to which a dozen dissidents were summoned.
About forty "Ladies of White", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were assaulted on the street by supporters of Raúl Castro's government as they walked towards the center of the capital demanding the release of the detainees, an AFP reporter said.
The Yankees die!, "Mercenarias!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Live Fidel and Raul!" the power militants shouted to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian-dressed agents who came to “protect” them.
On the eve, a similar demonstration sparked against the "White Ladies" in Havana, without injuries or arrests.
But in the Habanero neighborhood of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also rushing to protest on Thursday for International Human Rights Day, were detained by civilian-dressed police officers, an AFP reporter reported.
Agents forcibly climbed vehicles to dissidents who were bullied by government supporters, according to that journalist.
In general, the arrest of the dissidents in such circumstances only lasts a few hours.
The "White Ladies", awarded with the 2005 Sajarov Prize awarded by the European Parliament, had organized an unauthorized march to "solicit the release of all political prisoners", some 200 according to the dissent, said one of its leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Héctor Maceda, purges a 20-year sentence.
Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, of which 53 are behind bars.
Cuban authorities target opponents of “mercenaries” or “agents” at the wages of their declared enemy, the United States.
Very rare in the media, Cuban television reported on Thursday's demonstration of the government's militants against the "counter-revolutionaries".
Cuba, governed by a single party, the Communist Party, is constantly accused by European or American NGOs of undermining rights and freedoms, especially those of expression.
An alien kills an octogenerator with a knife and leaves 5 wounded in Clichy-la-Garenne
An unbalanced man with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and wounded five other people in downtown Clichy-la-Garenne (Sena Highs) on Thursday at the highest influx of the afternoon.
According to the early elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old aggressor would have hit with two knives and for reasons not yet determined, an elderly man in the pharmacy or in front of the pharmacy at No. 85 of Jean-Jaurès Boulevard, police sources and witnesses reported.
Following the serious injuries, the man born in 1929 died in the hospital, according to an official of the Alliance police union.
Then in the pharmacy or in front of it, he attacked a pregnant woman who was with her partner.
The 30-year-old man was interposed and wounded.
The first two victims, severely wounded, were transferred to the hospital where the elder died.
The life of the other wounded, with the vital organs apparently affected, is in danger.
The pregnant woman then suffered a dizziness and was hospitalized “in shock,” a police source said.
The gunman, who appeared to be under the effects of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would have escaped by Boulevard Jean Jaurès.
Apparently, he would have wounded two more pedestrians: one thirty-year-old man, and another forty-year-old seriously.
At night, the scene of the crime was still unclear.
He was armed with two carnivore knives carrying crosses on his back, a senior Alliance trade union official in the Seine, Arnaud Pressé, explained on the spot.
Several passers-by, including young people, tried to control the alien, according to testimony obtained by AFP.
I saw a 30-year-old guy with a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They didn’t do it because the guy was strong, Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar, explained.
A crowd was thrown over him, including a police officer who broke his wrist, he added.
On Boulevard Jean-Jaurès, at No. 61, two municipal officers, including the chief, tried to arrest the gunman and were wounded by punches, according to police testimony.
The events took place in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where numerous shops are located.
Some people came to tell me there was a wounded man on the street.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old man on the floor. Putting him in a safe position, I noticed a very important wound in the abdomen, told AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person, about 35, arrived, with knife wounds.
National police officers detained the man without identity documents.
The Nanterre Prosecutor ' s Office submitted the investigation to the jurisdiction of the Departmental Service of the High Judicial Police of the Seine (SDPJ 92).
The madman was hospitalized on Thursday night.
During his interim detention, he did not say a word.
A police source does not rule out the possibility of being admitted to a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six police officers to dominate him at Clichy’s police station where he was transferred.
It was "in a state of overexcitation" as "all disturbed of this kind whose forces increase considerably under the effect of action."
U.S.: Polanski’s lawyer again calls for the case to be dismissed
French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski's lawyer again on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, West U.S.) demanded that the case be dismissed against his client, who is under house arrest in Switzerland, for a case of sexual abuse that occurred more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, lawyer for the director of "The Pianist", denounced in front of three California Second District Appeals Chamber judges serious procedural errors at the time of the events, in 1977.
Hummel said: “I demand that the charges be dismissed at this very moment, as the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, “was outrageous.”
According to him, Judge Rittenband (deceased since then) would have spoken to a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to jail, before dictating a sentence, which constitutes a serious lack of procedural action.
This conversation was made public in the documentary "Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired" (Roman Polanski, sought and desired), from the mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Wells finally declared in late September that he had "lied" to the author of the documentary.
Hummel demanded a trial that would allow him to submit the evidence of his argument in case the court rejected the dismissal of the case.
The indictment, for its part, reiterated the argument put forward at first instance, i.e. that no dismissal of the charges could be seriously assessed as long as Roman Polanski did not appear before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978 before his sentence for “illegal sexual intercourse” with a girl under 13 was dictated.
Since then, he has never walked the United States again.
Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney Phyllis Asayama said Roman Polanski "must be here to present himself to the audience."
With this cause, we want to convey the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that there is a possibility of fleeing?
For her, the filmmaker “calls a favor to the court, although she despises his authority.”
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to pronounce his sentence, also stressed "there were other alternatives to the decision to flee."
Hummel was not the only one who asked to dismiss the case against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, also demanded, once again, closing the case.
She claims that her client no longer tolerates being harassed every time the Polanski case arises, and adds: “Nobody in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on September 26 on a U.S. arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was sentenced to home imprisonment in his Gstaad cabin, awaiting a possible extradition.
Wall Street loses track and slows down for dollar rise
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Friday without heading, in a market that is debated between better indicators than expected in the United States and the dollar rise: the Dow Jones won 0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final figures at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the Nasdaq, a technological component, lost 0.55 points to be set at 2,190.31 points.
Standard & Poor's 500 increased by 0.37% (4.06 points), reaching 1,106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very calm, said Mace Blicksilver, of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains with narrow margins, the volume of exchanges is increasingly reduced and I think it will remain that way until the end of the year.
The trend was maintained thanks to the publication of better-than-expected economic indicators, which “helped improve market opinion on the solidity of economic reactivation,” Charles Schwab’s analysts summarized.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November for the second consecutive month and higher than expected.
In addition, U.S. consumer confidence recovered visibly in December, 73.4 versus 67.4 in the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indices were slowed by a new advance in the dollar that reached the highest level in the last two months against the euro, which “leads down to sectors sensitive to the economic situation,” explained Owen Fitzpatrick, of Deutsche Bank.
In this way, technological values have lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury Bond rose to 3.540% vs. 3.482% on Wednesday night, and that of the 30-year Bond to 4.497% vs. 4.492% on the eve.
The election of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month’s tour of South Africa, the 112 candidates for the title of Miss Mundo find themselves in the final line to fulfill their dream: to be elected the world’s most beautiful woman in front of a billion viewers.
During this great celebration of beauty organized for the second consecutive year around Johannesburg, five of them have already achieved their participation in the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gibraltar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were chosen Miss Deportista or, even, Miss Top Model during her stay in Africa.
It was a real magazine.
It was extraordinary to visit beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town.
“I saw so many things and lived countless experiences!” said astounded Miss Sierra Leone.
This competition, which will be held for the ninth time in South Africa, will be broadcast live on Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, starting at 5 p.m. (15 h GMT).
It is impossible to imagine a better country to hand over my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am very happy to have lived twice, says Miss Mundo Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian woman, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and the possibility of rediscovering "African landscapes that take their breath away".
After a month of gala, rehearsals, press conferences and safaris, Miss Mundo candidates focus on the contest.
Pooja Chopra hopes to follow the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, winner in 2000 and present in this election, as well as Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both of whom became Bollywood stars.
Every woman’s dream is to be crowned as the most beautiful in the world, but it’s not just about appearance.
“We are the ambassadors of our countries, and I want to return to my country with the crown,” said Miss India with a big smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will mark this 59th edition.
Candidates will parade with traditional dresses and, of course, with bathrobe.
Chinese presenter Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean, and Miss World committee manager Steve Douglas will lead the event.
“South Africa has proven to be able to welcome the world with warmth and pride that are hard to match,” said Julia Morley, president of the Miss Mundo competition.
Like last year, the candidates took a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bike, and tasted local cuisine.
As an exceptional fact, they met the South African president, Jacob Zuma, who squeezed their hand.
Something uncommon for a head of state, observes Miss Sierra Leone.
His best memory will undoubtedly be the draw in Cape Town (Southwest) for the June 2010 World Cup, a way for the country to further promote the event.
I've been dealing with people I never thought I'd get to know.
She’s probably back for the 2010 World Cup, says enthusiastic Miss Italia, Alice Taticchi.
News about Johnny Hallyday "are very positive," according to his son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday is “very positive,” his son David said on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles airport to accompany his father hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
Dad is strong and everything is going very well, David Hallyday told the press when he got off the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after 13:00 local time (21:00 GMT).
The singer's son, who was deceased, said he would be transferred "as soon as possible" to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday entered on Monday for an infection derived from the disc surgery in Paris on November 26.
The musician has been “induced in coma since that night in Los Angeles for comfort reasons, to prevent him from suffering and thus be able to administer his treatment,” the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already undergone a coma induced by doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where he entered on Monday for an infection, following a disc hernia surgery on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was once again operated on Wednesday night to Thursday due to serious injuries caused by the previous intervention.
His wife, Laetitia, went to French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning, where his daughter, Jade, attends a school event, an AFP photographer confirmed.
The head of Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology of the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel to Los Angeles on Monday to be next to the singer.
The producer violently accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26 at the international private clinic of the Monceau Park in Paris.
They told us it was a massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, Camus said.
There is a possible demand, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus claimed that Johnny Hallyday had “traveled too fast to Los Angeles with the permission of the Parisian surgeon.”
I spoke directly to the doctor and was surprised when he assured me that there was no problem in making the trip, as I was operated twice on disc hernia, he added.
Shortly before on the RTL broadcaster, he said the singer had apparently gone “without cannula, nothing,” after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
She operated on actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where Delajoux was working at the time.
In 2007, I also intervened with actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorb a hematoma formed following a brain hemorrhage.
He is a doctor with a bad reputation, convicted on several occasions for misconduct, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, a lawyer for the Order of Doctors, accused him of being "a man without scruples" sued "regularly" before the Order Council, and is "far from being recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
This indicated that the intervention was "without any inconvenience" and that the results of the postoperative studies were "normal".
The operation "could not cause bleeding and therefore did not need drainage," he added.
In any case, the singer’s tour, whose health problems have multiplied since the summer, entered into a parenthesis.
No doubt, resuming the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, NDLR) as expected, it seems very risky to me, Camus said.
The UDF Association raises the tone and warns the New Center about the use of its acronym
The association UDF (Union pour la Démocratie française), controlled by François Bayrou’s MoDem (Democratic Movement), reacted on Friday to the attempt by the president of the New Center, Hervé Morin, to launch an OPA (Public Procurement Demand) on the syllable of the former party so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-in in-so-so-in-in-in-in-in, in-in-in-in-in-in, in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in, in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to retrieve the UDF slogan, considering that François Bayrou was not in a position to defend his political legacy after stretching his left hand.
On the other hand, the Minister of Defence, whose party is associated with the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
In support of his management, he was assisted by Deputy Hervé de Charette (former UMP, current NC) who claimed ownership of the UDF brand, since he was the first to register it at the National Industrial Property Institute in 2004.
But on Friday night, the office of the UDF association, controlled by François Bayrou’s friends who do not want to be deprived of it, broke the silence to launch a request to the Minister and MP by urging them to renounce the acronym and transfer them the rights of ownership of the brand, his sentence.
In recent days, you have made many statements insinuating that you were going to propose to your political movement to recover the UDF acronym, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez del MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Cent Atrihuis of the Alliance.
They also believe it is right to continue using the name of the movement, the <0x2B>Nouveau centre<0x2B>, and the slogan <0x2B>l'UDF d'aujourd'hui<0x2B> in their militant material and on the presentation page of their site, the signatories of the letter say.
As you already know, they have no right to use the acronym, explains the UDF office that requires the NC to "immediately remove the mention of the UDF name from any support, as well as from (its) website".
He also asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer the ownership of the mark to the legitimate rightholders".
Failure to do so, justice will be appealed to respect the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warn.
In the letter, they state that the UDF "is a true political movement since 1978" and recall that Morin and his friends "chosen" to leave in 2007 "to create a new party, as others had already done in 2002 to create the UMP."
Therefore, the New Center does not, according to them, have any right to use the UDF acronym.
They also recall that the last UDF congress voted in 2007 to join the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office in charge of defending "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valery Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when he registered the brand", was no longer "member of the UDF for three years", but of the UMP.
Scandalously and fraudulently take advantage of the absence of registration of the acronym UDF to do so on its own.
This indiscretion is turning into a crime, they complain, before joking about the NC strategy: “We believe that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make your own name than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which you are not entitled.”
Liliane Bettencourt case: François-Marie Banier to be tried for weakness abuse
On Friday, the Nanterre Court decided to sue artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as claimed by the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, she took advantage of the state of weakness of the octogenaria to expoliate her part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photos of the show, will be tried on April 15-16, 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime with a maximum sentence of three years in prison and a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>375,000.
This means that in this case there will be a process worthy of a saga about one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter argue the reins of the cosmetic empire L'Oréal.
But the Court of Correction No. 15 also ordered Liliane Bettencourt, 87, to undergo a medical examination by three medical professionals.
L'Oréal's heir and principal shareholder has always refused to undergo such examinations, even more under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
Physicians appointed on Friday will be required to submit a report before March 10, 2010, in which they will be required to state whether Liliane Bettencourt has suffered from weakness and for what periods.
I think he'll accept it.
I'm going to talk to her, Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, said after leaving the hearing.
Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers’ lawyer, Olivier Metzner, was pleased with the court’s decision.
“It’s excellent news (...) The expert will show that he (Banier) manipulated this senior lady, whom we must protect,” he said.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt’s only daughter has initiated criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, a multifaceted photographer and artist, accusing him of taking advantage of her mother’s weakness for years to obtain <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1 billion in donations, through checks, life insurance contracts or works of art.
Liliane Bettencourt has always denied being manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers a longtime friend.
On Friday, as the court examined the origin of the action filed by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' allegations resulted, on some occasions, in a large family confession.
In this way, Liliane Bettencourt’s lawyer took into account three letters that her client sent (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary in which she said she mistrusted Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers’ husband.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "I could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once or twice a day for fifteen years.
Since her wedding, I've never been able to talk to Françoise again."
For its part, the Prosecutor’s Office of Nanterre once again considered that the plaintiff was not in a position to appear, especially as a guardian judge refused in recent days to give rise to her request to open a judicial guardianship proceedings for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to appear before justice, is not under tutelage and has no tutor.
No one else will be allowed to appear in his place,” said public ministry spokeswoman Marie-Chrsite Daubigny.
Finally, the court decided that a judgement on the admissibility of Ms Bettencourt-Meyers would be held once the trial was conducted.
The Management Revolution or the End of Business Intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for the development of business intelligence will have been in vain.
More than a decade ago, the attitude of the management of large companies towards their employees recalls the position of the companies towards consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about employees adhering to "values" determined from above as before it was about imposing on consumers products thought by farica technicians.
By putting the customer at the center of the company, the marketing revolution gave rise to strategies to conquer the markets... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that are not related to customer preference factors is repeated regularly.
Demobilization of employees can result in a deadly demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects executives.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially R&D and, more importantly, business intelligence.
Indeed, the BI (Business Intelligence) "requires that all parties involved (...) have a proactive conduct and a forward-looking vision"; it needs on the part of employees a commitment that completely opposes the recommendations of an authoritarian direction.
For this reason, we call for a management revolution, which would consist of putting the employees at the center of the company’s concerns as well as the customer.
Internal opinion polls have a relative utility
Will internal opinion polls, such as the questionnaire carried out by Orange among its employees, incentivize the managerial revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
-In principle, because I was able to verify that, in the face of a new situation, and after many turns, all companies end up doing essentially... what they always did!
Secondly, because authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, grows in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
Finally, because most executives have a simplistic view of human behavior.
As they come from the great schools of engineers, they interpret psychology in a mechanical way.
They adopt, for intellectual comfort, the ancient behavioral theory that American "neurosciences" recently reactivated, and that Institutes of Studies and the media spread widely on their backs.
In this way, by suggesting that it is possible to handle the "commands" (sic) of the executives' commitment, a recent research by Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms the executives in a posture of mechanistic management, inadapted to today's world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the management revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises involves adopting a finalist view of human behavior.
It consists in integrating into every reasoning or practice of business management, a fundamental fact: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means to make reality part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Today, only studies from Motivational Analysis adopt this conception of employee motivations.
Studies have shown that they judge their company based on a predetermined doxa that allows them, through the image they have of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their own life projects.
Through the identification and measurement of mobilization factors, business managers can control, anticipate and anticipate their "social performance" and relocate human resources management "on the spot".
In this way, they create a favorable ground for the organized development of a strong and effective business intelligence.
Oslo speech: Obama receives praise from the right for “fair war”
On Friday, the U.S. right-wing, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize had defended the concept of “fair war” against U.S. enemies, Obama praised the speech on Thursday.
The Conservatives, who had discredited Obama’s award on October 9, this time applauded the presidential speech, as did former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin during the 2008 election.
I loved what she said, said Mrs. Palin, a Republican right-wing figure in the USA Today newspaper, and added that she had herself addressed the issue of war "sometimes necessary" in her recently published memoirs.
In my opinion, war is, of course, the last thing that Americans want to be forced to do, but it is necessary.
The terrorists must be arrested, he observed.
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, dedicated himself on Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send another 30,000 troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Obama’s other opponent, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done “a very good job” in Oslo.
I think that the speech was really very good, said the former President of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential words.
For a moment, the speech seemed very historic to me, Gingrich said, during an interview on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former elected representative, whom some consider a possible candidate for the Republican investiture for the 2012 presidential election, was pleased to hear “a president of the left” when he reminded members of the Nobel Committee “that they would not be free and could not deliver a peace prize” if the recourse to force did not exist.
According to Michael Gerson, author of George W. Bush’s speeches and current chronicler in the Washington Post, Obama pronounced “a very American speech.”
In addition to presenting himself as a “citizen of the world,” as “always does,” he “speaks like a U.S. president” by reminding Europeans “that they live in a security bubble that they didn’t create and that they don’t do much to preserve it,” Gerson said.
Among the few not very convinced right-wingers, a Bush-era hawk, former UN ambassador John Bolton, called the speech “monotonic, pretentious and lacking of inspiration” on the Internet National Review Online website.
Left of the president, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When we cover the war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocents, he warned.
However, the center-left press praised the president.
The Los Angeles Times, though still believing that Obama received the Nobel Prize prematurely, described his speech as “superproduction” especially for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech "should serve as a roadmap to guide international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression," the California newspaper said enthusiastically.
Obama “pronounced the speech that was necessary,” the New York Times said, judging it “at the same time as shady and uplifting.”
Road transport: three marathon talks to guarantee Christmas supplies
After three sessions of marathon talks, the road industry unions and the TLF (Transport and Logistics of France), the only patronage organization that remained until the end, reached an agreement on Friday afternoon that put an end to the strike slogan and the threat of supply.
During the signing session on Friday night, Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, was “happy” with the deal, following several negotiation sessions that began on Wednesday morning.
After a second evening of discussions, the negotiators fired at the dawn of Friday in the hope of quickly signing the text by the last hour of the morning.
Even though three employer organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) withdrew by giving a cover.
But a more than six-hour meeting that began at 11 a.m. was needed for everyone to agree and the text to be signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "would have been very damaging to businesses" and "were feared to disrupt the holidays at the end of the year," Bussereau said.
The text predicts a 4% increase for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport), and 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
The hourly rate rises from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8.72 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>9.06 for low wages.
It’s not much, but we started with a lot of disadvantages, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
If so, we are going to order our militants that there will be no more cuts or blockades in the supply centers.
But there can always be some dishonest rebel, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, acknowledged that this was "a good deal", although it was "difficult to grant high wages increases taking into account international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It’s a common sense agreement that respects employees, Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) recognized it as “a historic agreement.”
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) it is "an acceptable commitment".
The agreement also provides for an increase in travel costs of 3% and the holding of general road transport assemblies in the first half of 2010, which will primarily address the issue of extraordinary pay and a modernization of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that "a fall of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million in employer charges" was the subject of a government amendment to the draft correction finance bill for 2009, which the National Assembly voted on Thursday night.
The government will ask the Senate to vote on it "under the same terms".
The signing of TLF allows the agreement to be applied, firstly, to the companies that join this organization and, secondly, to the whole profession, in the event that the Minister of Labour makes an extension.
It will be done “with the greatest brevity,” Bussereau said.
The opposition of employer organizations could only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced it was a "naïve business" as the 100 million euros "were already promised to the sector to offset some of the CO2 tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate in an emergency situation, not as a conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties, but in order not to contradict those who wish to eat pavot at the next dinner of Nochebuena, UNOstra regretted.
For OTRE, the agreement puts at risk "the stability of very many SMEs in the sector over the next 12 months".
RER A: conflicts over the weekend, trade unions disagree with RATP proposals
Conflicts in RER A, France’s largest urban public transport line, will continue over the weekend, because at Friday’s meeting, the 2nd day of strike between trade unions and the leadership of the RATP, there was no agreement and the unions were dissatisfied with their request for premiums.
For this important Christmas shopping weekend, trains will only circulate between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays, at the rate of one train per two on the central stretch (between La Défense and Nation) and one train per four on the other lines.
The interconnection with the SNFC will be suspended in Nanterre Préfecture, which will force passengers to change trains.
The Lafayette Galleries, which expect 200,000 customers every day, were delighted that "RATP strives to provide service to the big stores".
The RER crosses the city of Paris from West to East.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
This Friday, approximately one in two trains ran in peak hours, and almost no trains in valley hours, as expected.
There was no riot on Thursday in the Andes thanks to the organization of the inhabitants of the Isle of France.
In this way, at dawn, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than usual, mainly due to the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), 29-year-old engineer Jack Nbakina explained that he had got up “an hour and a half earlier to arrive on time.”
The Saint-Lazare station was not saturated, SNCF said, which had foreseen police and law enforcement oversight.
The RER A operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from the Saint-Lazare station to join the metro.
New general gatherings of workers on strike will take place on Saturday and Sunday. The results, "unsatisfactory" according to the unions, of a meeting held with the management on Friday afternoon will be analyzed.
The Director of RER proposes to negotiate a specific protocol in all aspects of RER A: working time, professional development, etc.
That’s not what drivers want, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even puts its premium proposals in parentheses, the CGT said outraged, noting that the management was "not able to solve a problem that the SNCF and the road sector had already solved".
A new meeting is expected Monday to carry out “a more extensive analysis of the conditions of exercise of the profession,” the RATP said.
That also led the unions to say the company “didn’t care about weekend users.”
In the morning, about 150 drivers invaded a committee at the headquarters in Paris.
Then the management, who until then refused to dialogue during the strike, suggested the meeting "to calm the waters".
The conflict could extend to RER B on Tuesday, after the Unsa and the Independents had presented a notice.
Trade unions ask for a premium of 120 euros (United States) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independents) and complain about the degradation of working conditions on this line that has a million passengers daily.
RER drivers, all in the second degree of their professional career, charge from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross and from 600 to 650 euros of premiums, for schedules with alternate turns, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves pro-Kurdish party, a decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court ruled on Friday in favour of the dissolution of the country’s main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that immediately provoked protests in the Kurdish community, in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the task of the government, which has just stretched a hand to the Kurdish community trying to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society (DTP) party was disbanded because it had become the “focus of activities detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity,” the president of the Court, Hasim Kiliç, told the press after four days of deliberations.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, although only a majority of seven votes were needed to get the resolution, Kiliç said, adding that 37 of the party’s leaders, including its president Ahmet Türk and MP Aysel Tugluk, were separated from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the cessation of the parliamentary immunity Turk and Tugluk enjoyed, and the confiscation of the party's property by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 banks in the Parliament (of 550).
Its leaders warned before the verdict that MPs would leave Parliament before being MPs without a party label.
The decision comes from a procedure launched by the Supreme Court prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya in 2007, accusing the DTP of obeying the “principles” of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many more countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political display of the PKK rebels.
However, the party says it has no “organic ties” to the PKK, but refuses to qualify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The Court’s ruling comes at a time when the government is reaching out to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen their rights, so that Kurds stop supporting the PKK and thereby end the conflict.
DTP leaders claimed that a dissolution could generate an escalation of tensions in Southeast Anatolia, where a large number of protests against the detention conditions of the PKK chief, Abdullah <0xC3><0x96>calan, degenerated in clashes with police over recent weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of protesters have gathered in front of the DTP’s premises in Diyarbakir, the large southeastern guard mostly populated by Kurds.
The Order forces threw tear gas grenades and used water cannons, while the protesters threw Molotov bombs or rocks with limestones.
In Istanbul, about 100 people were also concentrated.
After the verdict, Türk claimed that the court’s decision was going to “profundize discouragement”.
Turkey cannot solve this issue (Kurdish, NDLR) by dissolving a party, he told the press.
The government, made up of a party from the Islamist movement, also regrets the decision.
In principle, we oppose the closure of parties.
So nothing is resolved, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said.
This decision boycotts the government’s democratic opening, political analyst Ahmet Insel said.
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK was awarded an attack in which seven soldiers were killed three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the bloodiest attacks in recent months.
Snowfall can start suddenly.
A truly cool winter is what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
It is absolutely something with which you want to make life impossible for citizens, comments FES’s road maintenance director in winter
But with this, your employees can learn to test and master the entirety of vehicle technology.
This weekend, meteorologists may announce it for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to deal with snow and ice.
In this case, the ESF acts in accordance with a thorough plan.
As soon as the snow profusely falls in Frankfurt and temperatures fall below zero degrees, 20 of the so-called sections A come out with large vehicles with salt, Brauburger explains.
These include, for example, major arteries and avenues such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also access to the body of firefighters, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and slopes with slopes, such as Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service starts around 3 a.m.
Approximately 1,040 kilometers should be covered, if necessary, in a maximum of three hours with wet salt, which adheres better.
That’s why the FES starts around 3:00 a.m., “with that the roads are free until peak hours traffic starts.”
The hardest part is when it starts snowing around 7:30.
“So we have a problem,” says the road maintenance director in winter, “because then no one is ready to clear up space for salt-based vehicles.”
Immediately afterwards, when it is no longer snowing, it touches the secondary and private roads, which also belong to the Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is the side and secondary streets.
That's where the inconvenience arises, you know Brauburger.
Around five in the morning the FES infantry is launched, mainly the dangerous points and cruises are cleared.
Generally, the ESF could not take charge of all bicycle lanes.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, which from 22:00 to 4:30 p.m. does not lose sight mainly of the bridges, comments Brauburger.
As these become slippery quickly, the salt vehicle starts off as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees.
In case of an emergency, the police can also call them.
The cradle of the dinosaur
The Tawa hallae looked the same as many other carnivorous dinosaurs: a two-metre-long and 1.50-metre-high animal running over the two strong rear legs, had an elongated head with sharp and curved teeth, short arms with claws in the form of a cloud and a long tail.
If the species had lived a couple of million years later, it would not have been anything special.
But the Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in Thursday's Science magazine.
The species lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which at that time was in a dry area of the supercontinent Pangea in Ecuador.
Tawa opened a new window to the early evolution of dinosaurs, Nesbitt comments.
It shows us a lot about the genealogical relationships, the spread and characteristics of the first dinosaurs.
Nesbitt and other paleontologists started an excavation at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico in 2006.
Sometimes, we have found in one day a dozen dinosaur bones, this is something unprecedented for Triassic sediments, reports Randall Irmis, a member of the Utah Museum of Natural History team.
The researchers quickly identified some bones as belonging to a new species.
In the course of the excavation, the remains of five specimens were collected in total.
A finding confirms theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt it is an exceptional finding: "Triace dinosaur fossils are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not share such enthusiasm at all.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs, for example, comments Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to the current opinion stream, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, so the classification of these first dinosaurs is quite controversial.
Thus, experts debate, for example, when saurys were divided into their three most important genealogical lines: carnivorous theropods among which are the Tyrannosaurus Rex, the Velociraptor and also birds, the sauropods aveene, the quadrupeds Orbíris, the "length neck" and the pelvises, and their relatives.
According to analysis by Nesbitt and colleagues, Tawa hallae is a primitive theropod.
This shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, comments Nesbitt.
For example, in Tawa's skull, the researchers found clues of airbags, such as those also possessed by the descendants of the theropods, the birds.
Thanks to airbags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
In the case of Tawa, the bones of the spine were also evidently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive airbag theropod, says Randall Irmis.
Because the related line of the later giant sauropods also possessed air bags and light bones, it was likely that the common predecessors of both groups already produced this useful innovation.
At least three migratory waves to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, researchers deduce that the saury originated there for the first time.
Therefore, the three genealogical lines were separated at first and spread from South America across all corners of the Earth, which by then still formed a unique earth mass, the supercontinent Pangea.
However, the facts say that the team found along with Tawa find the remains of two other theropods not very closely related.
The three cannot descend from a single related ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe there have been at least three migration waves to North America, comments Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the study Science.
Of course, there are opponents as well.
An even older species, Silesaurus, belonging to a brother group of dinosaurs, lived in present-day Poland, comments Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could give a distorted image, because in South America simply many fossils of dinosaurs are still preserved, while on other continents there is hardly anything to discover.
The question of how dinosaurs evolved from a relatively rare collar line from reptiles to the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of the Mesozoic remains an enigma.
In the Triassic, dinosaurs still shared their living space with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of current crocodiles and pterosaurs and many other saurians.
By the end of the Triassic, dinosaurs expanded around the world and many new species developed, while the kinship extinguished on the Triassic boundary towards the Jurassic.
Successful stories weren't eternal
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, comments Martin Sander.
There may have been a massive extinction that the dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they could defeat the opponents in the area.
Successful stories are not always eternal.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact slowed the rise of a group of species, which had also evolved in the Triassic and since then had a miserable existence: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and international signatories.
Professors from the University of Toronto, Cambridge, Vienna or Berkeley, California participate.
Teachers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen participated.
The police expulsion from the busy Goethe University’s casino in Frankfurt affected the world.
278 professors and professors from Goethe University, although also from higher education centres throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, are solidarizing with students in protest at the Westend Campus.
In a statement in German and English, they "refused" the police expulsion promoted by the board of directors.
Werner Müller-Estler, the president of the university, evicted the building last week occupied by students and teachers on an educational strike, because the walls and artworks were covered with propaganda.
As a result, five students suffered injuries.
The material damage, the signatories say, does not justify “the violent dissolution of courses organized by the same students and professors by a police command.”
The eviction represented an "unacceptable attack" on freedom of research and learning.
The exclusive focus on vandalism served to "delegitimize and criminalize the protest" and diverted attention from the content.
The Governing Council has refused to initiate the necessary negotiations.
Teachers demand the immediate withdrawal of the judicial claim.
Most occupants have not caused material damage, it is said.
Legitimate protest
The young people of the Verdi trade union and the German Federation of Trade Unions also solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for the future itself, comments Verdi’s national youth secretary, Alexander Klein.
Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), Minister of Science of Hessen, however, defended the performance of the rector of the university and the police.
We are grateful to the rector of the university.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, he commented in a broadcast by Aktuelle Stunde on Thursday in the Wiesbaden Province Parliament.
“We are understanding with the protest, but we are not understanding with vandalism,” said Peter Beuth, CDU provincial parliament delegate.
The opinion of the opposition factions, the SPD, the Greens and the Left, is different.
The CDU used painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, Janine Wissler (left) said.
Instead of thoroughly studying the students’ arguments and demands, they are discarded.
The Left has submitted a motion asking the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on police intervention.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was in the Soviet Union a heavily guarded site for secret armament investigation.
Today, the community of 216,000 inhabitants, located 37 kilometers from downtown Moscow, is considered the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Here are important research and production centers for micro and nanoelectronics.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenogrado have contacted the Riedberg Science Headquarters in Frankfurt, the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
Several mutual visits were made and now, on Wednesday, Selenogrado and Riedberg sign a "Protocol of Close Collaboration" in Frankfurt.
Moscow's Deputy Mayor Juri Rosljak and the Mayor of Selengado, Anatoly Smirnov, headed the Russian delegation; by Frankfurt signed the head of planning services Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and directors of small and medium-sized enterprises of the natural sciences research centre will travel to a seminar in Selenogrado.
Scientific Interchanges
It is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it also addresses business relationships.
FIZ companies will have the opportunity to put a foot in the growing Russian market.
In return, Russian scientific companies want access to contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is the headquarters of major Russian companies and research institutes.
Among them are, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large consortiums Sitronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so-called "Socialist Planning City" for armament research.
Selenograd (literally translated as "Green City") was named after the forested mountain landscape, in which research facilities were settled.
Brakes of Stuttgart
The Stuttgart 21 Dimension is not set for anything high enough.
For supporters of the project it is simply and plainly "the new heart of Europe".
S21 is much more than the reduction of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project, which will precipitate the capital of the Banden-Württemberg region a decade of chaos of irremediable construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 emerged in the spirit of the 1980s.
Terminals with rails, which end up in the middle of the city, were then considered 19th-century engineering fossils, which acted as the brakes of modern rail traffic, as it used to take a huge amount of time to hook the locomotives backwards forward.
Rotate, stop on dry, continue the journey; but this must be done.
And that’s why the terminals had to disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a crossing station, which is approximately halfway between the trans-European lines between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava; hence the slogan of "Heart of Europe".
The S21 will actually be launched, even though the 1980s visions are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have known that in the Hessian and Bavarian capitals it is almost inexpensive to implement the reduction.
The rail terminals of course also have no more input and output problems, since there are reversible locomotives with tractor unit and driver carriage at both ends.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the newly built ICE section towards Ulm will already be launched.
Federal and municipal politicians have arranged it this way.
The railway continues, also because the risks of the Republic’s large individual infrastructure projects are carried by the taxpayer and not the state.
From the urban point of view, the project is still justified to some extent.
New urban space is created, provided with many green areas, probably from the designer’s computer-generated graphics.
For the rail transport system, the S21 is harmful.
The transit station and road support are designed for passenger transport, which was attributed to the huge typical growth of the 1980s.
At that time there was no competition for low-cost flights.
But modern transport policy must first be concerned with strengthening freight transport, as rail transport is considerably more ecological than trucking on the road.
However, the new sections under construction are good for loading trains due to the intense gradients.
Even more serious is that the S21 also indirectly affects many other rail projects.
More than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 billion must be buried in the Zuavos.
That's the official figure.
Experts consider it to be more realistic between ten and fifteen billion.
It is certain that in the next decade the money will be lacking in other narrow crossings and passages on the network.
A total of 60 major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the extension of more than 180 kilometres of long rails through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, the slow-moving trail has been built.
It would be urgent here to step the accelerator properly.
However, the S21 acts as a brake.
The section of the Rhine Valley will be the bottleneck for international freight transport: through the heart of Europe.
The government is reviewing the ruling on the airport.
The federal government leaves pending in the Wiesbaden autonomous parliament, if it is going to bring an appeal against the Hesse administrative court’s ruling on the ban on night flights.
The CDU/FDP coalition seems to have commissioned experts to investigate the more than 400-page VGH ruling, according to Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
The administrative court in Kassel had reasoned in writing on this date that in the case of the construction of the planned northwest landing track at Frankfurt Airport, the federal state would have to re-regulate the ban on night flights.
Admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 p.m., as the federal government predicts, would not be compatible with mandatory legal protection of the noise population due to air traffic.
The coalition must decide by January 4 if it is going to bring an appeal against this ruling.
The opposition criticized this postponement and pressured government representatives to renounce the appeal before the nation’s Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD group, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, urged the CDU and the FDP to respect their pledges to ban night air traffic, which they had made before the elections, otherwise this could be taken as a word.
It is quite difficult, if one is allowed to fulfill his word, said Tarek Al-Wazir, head of the Greens, referring to the FDP slogan “We fulfill our word.”
Minister Posch rejected the recrimination of Schäfer-Gümbel, which the federal government would be attempting through law-abiding tergiversations and tricks to still obtain its night flights.
A thorough legal investigation would take a long time.
The coalition would not want to act on the basis of a “first quick impression.”
We need a legally intact decision, Stefan Müller (FDP) said.
As represented by the opposition, it would never have been his group’s statements about the prohibition of night air traffic.
U.S. banks return the aid provided.
The big American banks shocked by the crisis get rid of their state bonds.
The "Bank of America" returned the assistance provided to it by the Tarp Bank Rescue Fund of a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>45 billion (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 billion).
The Citi Group also plans to return state aid, according to a report by CNBC.
With this, the institutes aim to free themselves from restrictions that had gone hand in hand with the acceptance of money, such as the limitation in the payment of bonuses to directors, as well as the payment of high fees.
The "Bank of America" had gained approximately 19 billion cash through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum was taken from the box itself, which had many means, among others for the sale of rubles.
Bank Director Kenneth Lewis thanked U.S. taxpayers especially on Wednesday night: the financial injection helped to overcome very difficult moments.
The banking house had miscalculated the investment bank’s absorption effort in the climax of the financial crisis.
The Citi group also intends to get money in the capital market in order to be able to free itself from its obligations to the state.
CNBC reported from a source of known circles, that the U.S. bank could announce by Thursday the increase in its capital by <0x24>20 billion.
A representative of the Citi group did not want to comment.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already returned their aid.
Quick Election
In the end everything was faster than you thought.
Just two weeks after the board of directors of the ZDF (German television channel) pressured editor Nikolaus Brender to step down, the channel could introduce a successor.
Last night, the gremium intended to vote on the candidate.
Favorite was Peter Frey, director of the main ZDF studio in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this by the broadcaster, officially not to anticipate the procedure.
But it certainly also influenced not harming the ZDF director Markus Schächter any more, if this proposal was also not approved on the board.
Frey, Schachter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the board.
The result of the vote was not yet concrete at the closing of the drafting of this edition.
Two weeks ago Schächter failed in the board of directors with his proposal to renew for another five years plus Nikolaus Brender's contract.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's dismissal was a bitter failure for Schächter, but a failure that could be expected.
Because the majority of the Union on the board of directors had already indicated weeks before the election, that they were not going to support Brender in his position.
The opposition against the editor-in-chief had been organized by the president of the Hesse government, Mr. Roland Koch.
He declined another mandate from the prestigious editor-in-chief with the argument, that under Brender’s direction ZDF informants would have lost audience indexes.
Until shortly before the elections there were protests because of this, in which political influence on the ZDF flagged.
In the end, 35 public law specialists had been involved in the debate, who classified Koch’s case as unconstitutional.
But it didn't help.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romanesque philology.
He then worked on the broadcaster "Südwestfunk" and in the newspaper "Frankfurter Rundschau".
In 1983 it was changed to the ZDF, in principle to the informative "heute-journal".
Subsequent stations: 1988 to 1990 personal rapporteur of the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and conductor of the morning program "Morgenmagazins"; until 2001 director of the ZDF foreign policy; since then director of the ZDF study in the capital.
The political party of the Greens announced a constitutional lawsuit following the dismissal of Brender, who was elected on Wednesday as a journalist of the year by the media magazine "Medium Magazin".
Koch’s opposition on the board, the president of the Rhine-Palatinate government, explained last week that the federal states should change the ZDF state convention in such a way that the director’s staff proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
A retreat of supporters of the ZDF control panels was ruled out by Beck.
Brender's likely successor, Mr. Peter Frey, was recommended to the board with a smart play: he strongly criticized the gremio for Brender's dismissal.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence, Schachter was able to nominate him as editor-in-chief without losing his face, and the board of directors was able to vote for him, without falling under the suspicion of giving the position to a supporter sequel.
In the calculations of the parties Frey is awarded in every way to the liberals of the left.
College careers are unraveling
Partial success for students: After a year of education-related strikes, the Ministers of Education and Culture of the federated states finally surrendered. In a meeting of the Ministers of Education and Culture with university rectors, both sides agreed to try to improve the study conditions in bachelor’s and master’s cases.
Students in the future should be able to overcome their careers.
For example, they agreed to reduce the burden of exams: basically every module in the race should end with a single exam.
In addition, it is intended to examine the workload of students, and it is intended to guarantee a "real and justifiable measure".
The policy and universities also want to simplify the recognition of exam results between universities within and outside Germany.
The federal states are committed to more flexibly crafting the structural rules together for Bachelor and Master careers.
Regulations of the federated states that diverge from this should no longer exist.
Less exams
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the Ministers of Education and Culture and the rectors of the universities have been constantly talking about the improvement of being able to carry out and successfully complete a career (studyability).
This is the first time we have talked about specific content.
The so-called accreditation board agreed to drastically reduce the number of exams: “Each module ends with a single exam,” says a 30-page document, which aims to partially regulate the approval of university careers.
With the "sensitive reduction of the burden of exams" is intended to avoid development in the wrong direction, which would significantly affect the studentability, explained the director of the accreditation board, Mr. Reinhold Grimm.
In addition, in the future the "studyability" must be the decisive criterion in the configuration.
The modules and contents should be thoroughly examined regarding unnecessary restrictions on students in the choice of.
the courses.
Students would have “the right to get more space, which enables and encourages self-initiative.”
These rules would apply to new races, but also in the examination of existing races.
These should be "recredited" again every five years, but this would mean that it would take up to 2015 to examine all races.
The responsible for this would be nationwide 10 accreditation agencies, which are under the supervision of the accreditation council, which is set up by the federated states.
Ministers of Education and Culture urged the federal states in October to influence agencies in such a way that the amount of subjects and exams are not too strict or demanding.
In some federal states, universities and technical schools have already agreed with ministries to take such measures.
So far only Rhine-Palatinate has provided additional means for the subsequent development of the Bologna process.
With this money, universities must implement student tutoring and counseling programs, as well as strengthen exam offices and abroad.
The federal state and universities intend to provide <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million for these purposes.
In early 2010, the government wants to bring to parliament a novel of university law.
According to her, a single exam should suffice for the completion of a career model.
The career setting should be made more flexible, and the aim is to ensure the recognition of assessments in other universities and facilitate accessibility to the Master.
By the end of next year it is intended to examine all races about its "studyability".
On Thursday, the government and the opposition again discussed the conditions for studying in the federal state.
Apart from the praises, there were also criticisms about the decisions.
In the federal board of Juso (youth socialist) university groups, it was suggested that the setting up of educational policy should no longer be carried out "at the closed doors" of the ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the education strikes, now students as main stakeholders should be able to comment as well.
The chairman of the University Board of Directors (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, gave her support to students: “We need the experience of students,” she said Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education, with whom the HRK deliberated on a joint reform document.
For the education and science union (GEW) the Bonn agreements were not quite enough: the union requires a legal right for each student with a Bachelor’s degree the possibility of accessing a subsequent Master’s career.
In addition, the federation states have to ensure that for the current generation of Bachelor students there are in the future sufficient study places for the Master with the best possible study conditions. This was reported by a member of the GEW, Mr. Andreas Keller.
The federal states have to hire a lot more teachers.
But about increased access to the master, the Ministers of Education did not comment.
More than a footnote about Herta Müller
"Entering and leaving Germany is made virtually uncontrollable," says the first line of a poem by the lyric Werner Söllner in unbalanced linguistic fragments, in which it focuses on the experiences of arriving in Germany lived by a dissident, who gained his freedom but lost the environment of his language.
Werner Söllner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, initially worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest, and then as a reader in a children's book publishing house, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner was awarded several literature awards, in 1993 he taught memorable poetry lessons or lectures in Frankfurt at Goethe University, and since 2002 he is the director of the literature forum in Hesse at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He said he spoke a lot last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the disfigured mirror of his Securitate records"
Visibly insecure and embarrassed, Söllner read a statement in which he admitted participation as an IM in the Romanian secret service Securitate in front of fellow German-Roman writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of the presents in 1989, Söllner had received the German Language Award.
Recruitment attempts had begun slowly, in early 1971.
"So I'm someone who didn't defend himself enough against attempts to provoke fear from the Securitate," Söllner concluded.
The lyricist Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Herta Müller and her unparalleled literary controversy with dictatorial dominance mechanisms, the literary scene and especially the community of German authors originating in Romania is shaken by a case that evidences the abysses and evils of a political system, which is based on and controlled.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we know, not only an author, but also a victim.
In his Securitate IM dossier Walter had played a role, literary scientist Michael Markel said after Söllner’s confession, and stressed the positive influence for him of IM Walter.
I had excused him or defended him at all difficult points for him, Markel said.
"I feel the moral need to make this statement," he said.
Söllner’s statement in this way and in front of this audience was unexpected, the confession of an ex-dissident and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, does not surprise so much.
Germany would have been a comfortable refuge for spies from the Securitate-Spitzel, Herta Müller wrote in July in the weekly Zeit, after reading her own 914-page file.
Those involved must have speculated and in some cases have known what names were hidden behind the pseudonyms of Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike the review of Stasi records with a controlled procedure in Germany, the handling of the Securitate records is still quite widespread.
A systematic clarification has been boycotted and hardened in recent years.
A National Board for the Clarification of Security Records (CNSAS) was formed in 1999 by the Birthler Authority, and the delivery of the records has since been rather traced.
Since 2005, there has been a law regulating the administration of records.
An interview, after the awarding of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Herta Müller, proves that the influence of former members of the Romanian Securitate is still quite large. In this interview a former head of the Securitate of Temesvar spoke desperately of the decorated.
“She has psychosis,” she was questioned only once.
The infamy of power seemed to be able to be shown without turning in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, inevitable questions arise with the Söllner case, as many times when there are silent faults.
The calm reaction of the listeners to Söllner’s confession makes it hope that the continuation of this story will be governed more by the cravings of knowledge and not so much by the assignment of guilt and shame.
For the Genesis of Herta Müller’s work, which accepted the Nobel Prize in Literature yesterday, it is more than a mere footnote.
The Champions League as a garnish to fill the stomach
When the new coach of Stuttgart's VfB football team, Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from the supplier of his team, boarded a Mercedes C-Class taxi a quarter of an hour after midnight, it gave the impression that a member of the outer service very stylishly celebrates the outerwear, dressed in a slippery item.
The man of the characteristic Calva had hired a driver, because he did not yet know the city.
By the way, he could also have driven the car himself: after all, there was no alcohol at stake, and the 55-year-old was not drunk with joy either.
It had been a nice evening, but tomorrow I would start work again.
It would start for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, who had been hired just three days earlier: "It is true that we reach the eighth of the finals", i.e., in the Champions League, thanks to the 3:1 victory against Romanian Unirea Urziceni, "but we can't let ourselves blind for success: we will have to fight brutally against the decline."
The “much more important task” awaited them next Sunday, he said.
Then, it will be necessary to repeat in Maguncia the success of the "real classes" in the daily life of the league.
And eliminate the weaknesses, which have been clearly demonstrated again, after the quick three goals of Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Sorteo
The Champions League finals (return games on 16/17 and 23/24 February/return games on 9/10 and 16/17 March) will take place on 18 December in Nyon.
So the joy was limited by the fulminant entry of Babbel's successor.
Not only in the supposed savior, which in short time had inspired the distracted Stuttgart professionals self-confidence, willingness to surrender and taste for the game.
I went with the players and told them that they had to focus on their strengths, I urged them to be more released, explained soul repairer Gross his recipe for success that sounds so simple, but that with the therapist Babbel he had no effect anymore.
He deployed a certain magic, Babbel's supporter Jens Lehmann accepted, "when a new impulse arises in football, sometimes things happen that weren't thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who after a several-week break due to an injury quickly advanced to become the best local player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomena" perceived with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the way the new boss works: "He is a man who demands to intervene, and discipline thoroughly.
This is what we need in the current situation.”
And this is what was lacking, obviously, when Babbel was.
VfB Stuttgart has not passed the test yet, sports manager Horst Heldt warns
But the VfB Stuttgart needs above all consistency.
Like Gross, the players and the manager refrained from overestimating the victory against a weakened defense due to lack of reliefs and completely overstated by the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with the 0:4 came the sad awakening, made Khedira think.
And manager Horst Heldt warned that while one goal of the season had been achieved, the other was still far away.
We have not yet overcome the problem.
That Heldt did not want to celebrate his 40th birthday, even after the first victory at his headquarters in three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which were re-released in the form of a television interview, broadcast just before the start of the game, which had been granted by porter Jenh Lens.
There are decisions that others make, and not Jens, Heldt faced harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had blamed weakness in the direction of the board, which had decided to change from coach to pressure from teen fanatics.
Also that his day off after the games had been eliminated, Lehmann called it a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann’s statements were “marked by pure selfishness,” Heldt repeated, announcing consequences for the latter.
They will probably not be friends forever, the two quarterbacks.
But at least they agreed with everyone else that, without the previous efforts with the substitute coach’s team, the show of great play and battle might not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "an important part in the success," Heldt and Lehmann said at the unison; and also agreed the man in the plastic suitcase.
Category: World Heavyweight championships
Burning duel in Bern: challenger Kevin Johnson was provoking world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title in the WBC version.
The judge’s judgment was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko remains world heavyweight champion.
The 38-year-old in the WBC version defeated American Kevin Johnson by unanimous points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109) on Friday night in Bern.
For Klitschko it was his third successful title defense since his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was already twice world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to carry out the nocturnal work that everyone had expected.
Klitschko expanded his balance to 39 triumphs in 41 professional fights, twice overturned due to his injuries.
Defender Johnson had to accept the first defeat in his 24th fight.
In front of some 17,000 spectators in the Berne Arena, Klitschko, with a height of 2.02 meters, wanted to dictate the fight especially with his left hand.
But Johnson, eleven centimeters lower than before the duel had proclaimed the end of Klitschko’s era, was avoiding the world champion’s blows over and over again, so Klitschko could not decisively bring his dangerous right to his goal.
In general, passive Johnson did too little for a challenger, and only tried to pass the rounds.
While he was provoking Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows only rarely reached the world champion.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who endured twelve full rounds with Klitschko.
Before the fight, the challenger had already produced a certain scandal in the Swiss capital.
He had insulted Klitschko as a "horrible zombie" who "can't do anything."
While performing the weighing, the champion was allowed to provoke on Friday to remove Johnson's sunglasses from his nose "to be able to see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Klitschko's return
Also in his fourth fight after his return on October 11, 2008, Klitschko remained invincible.
After a break of almost four years, he defeated then Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, and had recovered his WBC belt, which he had previously had to deliver without fighting.
That year he later defeated Juan Carlos Gómez, from Cuba, and Chris Arreola, from the United States in September.
In this fight I only received a blow, and I am in very good physical condition, Klitschko had explained his quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains to gather all four important titles in his family.
His brother Vladimir is world champion of the WBO and IBF associations.
However, the belt belongs to the British David Haye, after he dethroned Nikolai Valujev in November, 2.13 meters tall.
The previous summer, Haye had canceled a fight against Vitali Klitschko scheduled for September.
The company that promotes it is already planning the fight against Klitschko at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Opposition front attack: The head of the Greens group, Jürgen Trittin, called the Defense Minister Gutenberg a liar because of false information on the Kunduz case.
The SPD and the leftists demand explanation from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin – Following the latest revelations about the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition has accused Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU) of knowingly cheating.
In Saturday's "Tagesschau" news broadcast on the ARD television channel, the head of the Greens' group, Jürgen Trittin, said the minister "didn't knowingly say the truth" about the deadly two convoy bombardment.
In such a case, it is usually said: he said lies.
The killing order would have been given without taking into account the rules of the International Protection Troop for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the report NATO had, and which Mr. Gutenberg has read, Trittin said.
On Friday, it was announced that the attack was not only about destroying the trucks kidnapped, but also intentionally killing two Taliban leaders.
In the U.S. airstrike, requested by the German commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, according to the NATO investigation report, up to 142 people were killed or injured.
The Greens, the SPD and the left urged federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to speak immediately before the federal parliament and to clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Merkel needs to clarify whether an intentional murder strategy is part of Afghanistan’s federal government policy, and whether the chancellor, the army and the intelligence service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and her colleague from the Greens Renate Künast demanded.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm resolutely rejected criticism.
The chancellor did not exert any influence on concrete actions by the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts had also been raised about the Ministry’s presentation on the grounds for the firing of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL information, both had informed Gutenberg correctly and completely about the background of the convoy attack.
It had officially been said that they had denied the existence of NATO reports and had concealed delicate details to the Minister.
However, from the outset of the two high-ranking officials, it was clear that they had even pointed out to the Ministry of Defence the existence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein, who was in command, and a report by a field patrol.
Meanwhile, Wichert would have asked in a letter to clarify the matter, reports the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung".
So far he has not received an answer, he said.
The ministry did not express itself on Saturday regarding the accusations made to it, and said this would be clarified in the Federal Parliament's inquiry committee, which will be formed next Wednesday.
Oniric worlds
In the wake state, some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of mentally ill people and drug addicts, the boundaries between imagination and reality fade away.
As long as it happens during sleep, everything is in order.
When we are lying in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we can surrender without delay to the wildest imaginations and creations of fantasy.
However, whoever experiences sleep-like states during the wake, or sees and hears things that others do not see or hear, is most often considered in the modern Western world as crazy or drug addict, or at least as maniac.
But such images and voices do not only arise in the mentally ill or in the drugged.
The fault is our imagination: the same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, sometimes make the boundaries between sleep, madness and reality unravel.
The states of alert consciousness that are altered or naively can appear in the most diverse forms, in the best of cases we call them visions, and in the worst, madness.
Although the triggers and effects can be distinguished, similar processes can be referred to the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the psychedelic experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castañeda, the states of shamanic possession, and psychosis and hallucinations.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of neuronal communication substances in the brain – especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine – has been unraveled and the interaction between various parts of the brain is disrupted.
During schizophrenic psychosis very often, complex hallucinations and insane thoughts appear.
Gravity no longer has power over it.
The relationship between madness and sleep has occupied philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle conceived hallucinations as a form of awake sleep, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, observed in 1861 a "great resemblance of the state of madness to the oniric states", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even a form of skepticism, all forms of skepticism, and all psychosis.
It is the fall of 2001, when Henning T. becomes a comic figure.
His body is two-dimensional and scandalously colorful.
Gravity no longer has power over it, it is floating near the roof of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, figures of demons with wings, with red muzzles like blood, deformed, shrimping teeth.
They're chasing him, they're kicking him in heavy, flaming boots, they're throwing him against the walls, he's feeling the pain all over his body.
Striking and malignant voices sound from the walls and the radio.
He can no longer bear them, the voices that insult and insult him.
Henning T. pulls out two stereo cables, ties them to form a hanging node, and fixes them in a hook on the ceiling.
It goes up in a mouth and puts the knot around the neck.
Jump.
The rope is loosened.
What a lesson!, shout the voices in a choir that whispered to him the chimpanzees, "Go to the clinic and make you heal!"
Now, Henning T. is 40 years old and has experienced six acute psychosis, the last two years ago, the first nearly 20 years ago.
The reason for this was LSD.
His diagnosis is schizophrenic-affective-paranoid psychosis, he is also maniaco-depressant, taking medications, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis I have experienced the most terrible distress and the deepest despair, he says.
Hallucinations are a cruel reality
Approximately one percent of the population falls ill at least once in their life of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, most often those affected can no longer distinguish between the outside world and the inside, and fall into a state of overexcitation that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of greatness, disorders in the relationship, or persecutory mania.
Especially extended is the hearing of voices: voices that give orders, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also common.
The affected person is no longer able to distinguish what is important from what is not, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like sleep, psychosis opens the door to a stream of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, says professor Thomas Fuchs, doctor-in-chief of the general psychiatric clinic at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is at the center of events, everything has a meaning directed to it.
At the same time, he enters a passive role, as in a dream, he feels overwhelmed by events and cannot actively organize them.
This is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general, it is not possible to adjust reality to them, hallucinations are a cruel reality, waking up, impossible.
Having experienced a hallucination once in life
Unlike in a dream, Fuchs says, “the spatial and sensory structure of reality that is perceived in psychosis remains in principle as it is.”
Paranoid thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the distance from the experience takes place in reality.
For researchers still an unknown reason why our brains make cabrioles.
According to Fuchs, state of emergency can lead anyone to lose contact with reality temporarily.
But not everyone develops a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic disposition for schizophrenia, but studies in twins have shown that in addition to the genes, there are also other determinants.
Researchers suggest that those affected suffer minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the neuronal maturity of the brain is affected at an early stage of development, such as through a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But it remains an unknown how this alteration of the nervous system occurs, which also does not manifest itself at all for many years.
The influence of the environment also plays an important role – stress or a traumatic experience can be the triggers of a psychosis when a pre-arrangement already exists.
Similarly, hallucinogen drugs can cause psychosis, as they interfere with the transmitting system of the brain.
When the brain warms up
The illogical thing about all this is that psychotic people suffer from their hallucinations and take very expensive medications to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experiment with some, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
Perceiving a hallucination as pleasant or not often depends on the point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and visions for ten years and has analyzed the results in the book Die unreale Welt in unserem Kopf, published last year.
Hallucinations are among the typical accompanying symptoms of psychosis, but also, surprisingly, many other diseases.
Among them, along with mental disorders such as personality limit disorder or depression, often also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's and cranioencephalic trauma.
Surprisingly and under certain conditions, the brain of healthy people also suffers from hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, are composed of memories that are usually suppressed.
They arise when the areas of the brain in which sensory perceptions are processed are hyperactive or are little coercive; when our brain warms up, but also when stimuli are missing.
Drugs can cause this condition in the same way as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the restriction of stimuli, stress, bad love or other exceptional brain states.
In recent studies, up to a third of respondents reported having experienced hallucinations at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. was 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania and attending a secondary school.
A hot girl.
If it wasn't for those pictures and voices.
Sometimes, during recreation, it happens that a boy with long, dark hair turns the word to him.
When she answers, the other students stare at her; no one, apart from her, hears or sees the boy.
They think the timid girl is a slightly strange dreamer, but Sarah K. knows she’s not dreaming.
She is awake and she sees and hears that boy, just as she sees and hears the girl sitting on the bench next door.
You can even feel your presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, he likes the guy.
Sometimes she asks if she’s crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the rest of the visions are not real and disappear.
At night, the appearances are alarming.
Visions are often a burden.
When you’re in class sometimes you can’t follow the lesson because the teacher – in his eyes and ears – is presenting a new colleague, while for the rest explains mathematical equations in a visible and audible way.
At night, the appearances are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room for the sleep to arrive, which often comes late and is scarce, she does not know whether she is awake or dreaming, whether the images she sees, the skulls or the girl with bleeding cuts in her arms and legs, appear in front of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, yelling at the figures.
He hasn't told his parents and friends anything, they'd think he's crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. Today is 20 years old.
She passed selectivity last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago the hallucinations disappeared.
Since she's been in contact over the Internet with psychologist Kasten, she knows she's not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art for despair.
According to Kasten, when a person is socially isolated or suffers from a restriction of stimuli, it is very likely that after a while they begin to have hallucinations.
I think the brain is unoccupied and takes care of it for entertainment.
Sarah K., a single daughter, was little afraid of the other children and often played alone.
His hallucinations began when, at the age of 13, he learned that the man he called Dad since he had used reason is not his biological father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real impressions and noise, those affected like Sarah K. It is difficult to distinguish between vision and reality. “Every experience,” says Kasten, “is taking place in the brain, reality is projected there.
Hallucinations are also images that the brain produces, which is why they seem so real.”
Kasten also classifies night fantasies as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their visions as unreal.
Kasten therefore recommends his patients to appreciate his hallucinations as a special skill.
The boundary between sleep and hallucination
In this world too consciously focused, imaginary experiences usually become pathological, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, a professor in Heidelberg and head of the psychiatric and psychotherapy clinic at the Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhäusers hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a hard and painful disease but it also involves something positive and creative – madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated the so-called oneirism, a special form of consciousness, which is perceived as a dream.
Oniric hallucinations are almost very complex and detailed dreams that the person who experiences them considers real and that subsequently cannot differentiate from being awake.
Oniric conscious states arise in extreme situations associated with trauma or disease, such as in patients with polyradiculoneuropathy, who experience motor paralysis being fully aware.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of himself or the world due to a total and permanent motor incapacity, it replaces a very dangerous real situation with a self-imaginary world that is uncoupled from reality.
A form of boundary situation between sleep and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, a world change occurs, although the real situation remains present in the imagination.
An intensive way of giving meaning and interpretation to an unparalleled situation in itself that our own ability to create allows us not to sink into nothing of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
Art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen of Zurich also describes his oniric experiences in his book Herzwechsel as an action to save the soul.
He was 49 years old, when his conscience embarked on several-day trips after a heart valve surgery with a heart transplant included, while his body was sentenced to immobility at the intensive care station.
Claussen plunged into a world created by him and visited strange places of other times: he saw himself lying in bed, an older man on board a sanatorium in a train, a robot guarded for his health.
It was seen in the High Middle Ages, surrounded by nobles who produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek on a motorbike kidnapped him in his home country, surfed his hospital bed in the Alps with snow fir and met a Korean mafia.
It gives everything in these imaginary facts, everything is real, even later in the memories.
For Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dreaming is a different state, so describe your experience.
On the contrary, the memories of mental journeys are, many years later, much clearer, even in irrelevant details.
It’s even brighter and more intense than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience dilutes the horizon of the rest of our daily experiences, adds psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneirism, psychosis, hallucinations, and drug use show how fragile the inner reproduction of external reality is, even when we are awake.
Any modification of the state of consciousness, psychologist Kasten summarizes, “can lead to a deformation of what we call reality.”
An experience that, on the other hand, can be completely enriching.
The snow can come
Burda
Children will take charge of the editorial at age 27
The new editor Kallen has reached a provisional solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave his company in the future in the hands of his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg – Editor Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the future.
The two children become heirs at the age of 27 and have the firm will to enter the company, Burda, 69, confirmed to SPIEGEL.
The details have been arranged as a precautionary measure.
The next question is whether they will be actively involved in the company.
Also, if they are trained for it.
You cannot put your children in front of 7,500 workers if they are not trained enough to do so.
That would put an end to the kids and the company as well.
Burda announced Thursday that he will retire from the chairmanship of the board and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been appointed as his successor.
This 52-year-old member of the Kallen family has been a member of the management of Burda since 1999.
Initially, he was responsible for technology.
After Jürgen Todenhöfer’s departure, he was also responsible for direct marketing, overseas, printing and finance.
For the first time, no family member occupies the top of the editorial.
The children of Burda are 19 and 17 years old, and their son Felix, who would now be 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen’s designation also serves to, “save the differences of 10, 15 years,” according to Burda.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Looking at the Schickedanz and Schaeffle cases, Burda stated that family businesses are also not safe from decadence: “This has always affected families who are infected by the desire to search for capital, who have misjudged and thought they could rise as well as the biggest player.
That has never been my strategy.
I have never had “delusions of greatness,” Burda says.
I don’t see myself as a political preceptor in this country, as Springer was, and I also don’t want to play with Time in the World League; those businesses have become too big.
Integral Beauty
Anything you can desire – in terms of beauty and well-being – at your fingertips.
This is what appears to have been proposed El Corte Inglés, which has just inaugurated in the shopping center of Callao (Madrid) a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 dedicated to body care and mime.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, has prestigious firms such as Hedonai - who is in charge of laser hair removal-; Spaxion, with relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments; Luis & Tachi hairdressers; Marina d'Or, which owns a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a food section, where the bakery stands out, with more than 130 different classes from this infusion.
Enjoying a relaxing massage with your partner while contemplating the unbeatable views of the capital, or renting the relaxation area for two hours to ride your own ‘beauty party’ with eight of your friends and relax with a jacuzzi session, massages and taking a cup of champagne are some of the possibilities that Spaxion offers.
In total, 250 m2 are distributed in 12 rooms to perform the latest and most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
For example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibratory platforms.
The gym also features these machines, as well as a virtual ‘trainer’ that will guide the steps of the customers, offering them a completely personalized treatment.
It all starts by entering your personal key on a touchscreen, located in front of the machine.
Then, several videos show us how to properly perform our exercise table.
His director assures that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretching) are enough to exercise all the muscles of the body.
And, if after exercising our body, we want to go through the hairdressing, the Luis & Tachi firm has a room where hair recovery rituals, luminosity or personalized nutrition are offered.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the premises of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year, from 10:00 in the morning to 22:00 in the evening.
Various listenings
Christmas is approaching and it is never again time to review the looks of the stars to adapt them to our party dressing room.
The shape of the necklace, very important to enhance the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must take into account.
Here are a few suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated sketch. It is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, by electric car
The electric company Endesa, together with the City of Barcelona, have created the 'Office LIVE'.
This is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The 'Office LIVE' (Logistics for Electric Vehicle Implementation) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the deployment of electric cars in the city and achieve agreements on mobility, managing, coordinating, submitting subsidies, etc.
On the other hand, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, gather the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
In short, it aims to drive what will be the transport of the future.
3 'Electrical Cities'
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the deployment of an electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the Government, within the MOVELE Plan, to drive the deployment of the electric vehicle.
Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat de Catalunya.
The aim is to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These include activities related to energy and, in particular, energy efficiency.
Endesa is not the only initiative involved in the promotion of the electric vehicle.
The company participates in standardisation groups at European level and has assets of a number of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees ‘a horizon of tranquility’ for the motor industry
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, views "a horizon of tranquility" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the country's main exporting sector.
In the presentation of the President of the Government’s 2009 Economic Report, Zapatero reviewed the measures the Executive has taken throughout the year to support the automotive sector.
“Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, today we would have a panorama of abandonment, the closure of some of our main production plants,” the president said.
"Thanks to this plan and the availability of brands to follow in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can have a horizon of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our main exporting sector," he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Integral Automotive Plan (PIA), allocated 800 million to projects from 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilized an investment of more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion.
The chief executive explained that this investment was committed to both the development of new models and to modernizing existing products and processes.
Zapatero also stressed the governmental measures to support demand, in allusion to Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive brands.
According to the president, this plan has allowed to reduce the average emissions of new vehicles marketed in the Spanish market by 6% and has led to a "strong increase" in registrations, which grew "40 percent" in November.
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Classic Vehicle Salon will be held in Madrid, a meeting place for professionals and motor lovers.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Crystal Pavilion of the Casa de Campo de Madrid.
This is an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters in which there will be more than 200 national and international exhibitors.
Not only will you be able to find classic motorcycles and cars, but in ClassicAuto Madrid you will find items of all kinds related to the world of the engine.
Thus, among the exhibitors of the pavilion, you can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of classic motor that will make the delights of collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies are, among others, Classicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, restoration; Coupe-Francisco Pueche sale and restoration of cars; or Cochera Classicos, specialist Mercedes Benz.
Skill tests on the outside
In addition, the commercial activity of this Salon will be completed with parallel activities: celebration of concentrations, sports exhibitions, skills tests, presentations and competitions.
Skill tests with classic cars and motorcycles will also be performed on an enabled circuit outside the fairground.
Mazda3 i-Stop: sustainable sportiness
Mazda wants to show that sportiness is not bound up with respect for the environment.
Therefore, the Mazda3 has just incorporated the stop and start system of the engine -called i-Stop-, a device that is at least currently only available with the gasoline 2.0 engine with 150 hp.
This second generation of the Mazda3 stands out for the good score achieved as a whole.
Finishing, vehicle termination, habitability, behavior, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are outstanding in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving position, we check that the front boots have excellent ergonomics and grip.
The touch of the steering wheel is also exquisite.
Continuing with the set formed by the instrument frame and the console, we see how Mazda has continued the Japanese trend to create a futuristic interior design, with a lot of buttons and controls and striking colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of what the Honda Civic also presents.
Therefore, we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more specifically the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
Continuing with the cabin, this Japanese compact features more than enough habitability for four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
All this adds to a large luggage compartment and with regular shapes.
The automatic stop and start system of the engine, at least for the moment, is only available with the two-liter and 150 horsepower gasoline engine and with the manual six-speed shift.
This engine is a real delight. It is superseded by its fineness, its reduced noise, its performance and its content consumption.
And it is that although the most demanding Mazda3 will be the diesel versions, those who do not make a high number of kilometres per year should not discard this petrol-powered i-Stop, both for its high running comfort and for its content consumption.
Regarding the level of equipment, the version chosen for the test is the so-called Sportive, i.e. the one that incorporates a greater number of serial elements.
From the standard equipment especially stand out the track change assistant (RVM) which removes dead angle, traction and stability controls, speed control, indoor photo-sensitive mirror, on-board computer on a large screen, parking sensors, independent air conditioner, bth and air conditioner, rain and rain sensor, and lights
In addition, for the small amount of equipment, this version featured the Premium Pack, which adds for 1,500 euros: xixenon adaptive headlights and BOSE sound system with disc charger, among other elements.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compacts in the category.
It stands out especially for the quality of the materials used, for their behaviour and for the high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not drive many kilometres per year will be able to opt for this i-Stop version, associated only with the gasoline 2.0 engine of 150 hp.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which sits between the 21,770 euros of the Luxury finish and the 23,270 euros of the tested version -Sportive-.
In exchange for this high figure, the Mazda3 will offer us daily large doses of satisfaction.
"Premier" of luxury
L.A. covers the red sensuality carpet of Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have unveiled more than ever wrapped up in stylish models like 'sexys' in the premiere of 'Nine'. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', as sophisticated as usual, opted for a dark 'lady'.
The Promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to look at mail, without even the possibility of seeing certain types of attachments or browsing the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the U.S. when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is harder, indeed, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low monthly fee, less than half of what is paid, for example, for the iPhone’s data plan.
Given the success of the company, the company has brought out two new devices: one exclusively designed for Twitter, the other with a free lifetime data service in exchange for paying six times more for the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It is as limited as its American counterpart, but comes with a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price, about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>12 per month, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those traveling with a smartphone already know what it’s like to have to give up data when crossing the border or desperately look for a coffee shop with WiFi (or a Fon connection) to be able to access the mail.
The idea of fixed-price roaming is incredibly attractive and long ago it would have to be in operation.
Yes, some carriers have special arrangements and travel plans, but in my experience it takes a Ph.D. in physics to understand them and a good glasses to read the small letter.
The repeated European Commission earshots to achieve affordable roaming rates across Europe have barely had a noticeable effect.
Outside the country of origin there is fear of using the data, and rightly so.
That an appliance like FonPeek (it’s still curious to get the name of Fon when it lacks Wifi) gets this kind of fees means that operators start thinking differently and study different proposals to amortize their data network.
Kindle is another good example, including book download traffic and other Internet queries.
No contracts and no boots.
It’s a connected device and you pay for it when you buy it, not month by month.
And that’s what I hope to see someday with FonPeek, a lifetime-access purchase option like the one that Peek already has in the US.
Not because I'm going to buy it.
I look at my mail on the phone, thank you.
I expect it because I think it is a more fair model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's fetish color
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite tone of the American First Lady.
If he has already attended the takeover of Barack Obama as President of the United States with a dress and a coat of this color, he has chosen the same to accompany him in, undoubtedly, the second most important moment of his life: the gathering of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has worn a very similar model on both occasions: in addition to being a similar color – green yellow with glossy reflections – the outfit consisted of three pieces – dress, jacket and coat of the same fabric – and was adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So much so, that at first glance it seemed that the first lady of the United States followed the stele of the Princess of Asturias and had chosen to repeat dressing.
But the fabric in which the two suits are made makes them very different.
If for the possession of a fat fit, in Oslo it is a terciopelo with stampede.
The accessories have also varied: green mid heel shoes again, and a similar model, but in gold, now.
And equally different is the hairstyle: a collection this time, melena releases the previous one.
75% of working mothers have had work problems because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of the younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study 'Fecundity and career path of women in Spain', developed by the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute of Women.
The survey of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt about this: 75% of working mothers have seen limited employment opportunities due to maternity.
The study points out that there are many differences in the onset of coexistence in couples and the number of children, depending on whether they work or not and the type of work they develop.
Those who do not have an activity outside the home, work part-time, or have an unstable job, start cohabitation earlier, advance first maternity, and have more children.
On the contrary, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, delay coexistence and maternity, and have less offspring.
“Women aged 35 to 49 with fixed employment have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after starting cohabitation, a figure that rises to 4.1 women with fixed jobs have needed more time from their vital trajectory to achieve them, which has led them to postpone the union and arrival of the children.
In addition, the type of work performed exerts a lot of influence on maternity but less on the mating schedule,” explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of study is another factor that differentiates the age of women by getting married and having the first stem.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the higher the age at which they get married and to which they have their first child.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49-year-old group, those with elementary and higher education were mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 average, respectively.
“There is also another division between women based on their level of study.
While those who have elementary studies get married and have their first child before getting a stable job, those of middle or higher levels invest this sequence and give priority to obtaining a stable job as a precondition for marriage and the arrival of a child.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its enviable list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress will become an image of different brand products, embodiing the universal slogan of 'Because I Valve It'.
The protagonist of 'Joyeux No<0xC3><0xAB>l', one of the most elegant actresses on the international scene, joins other famous L'Oréal Paris figures, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter such a select club were actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Slumdog Millonaire').
In the men's section, the cosmetic brand also features luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's companion in 'Lost').
The British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
His top representatives – designers and models of yesterday and today – met at the annual awards ceremony held in London at the Royal Court.
No one missed the date.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter, Georgia May Jagger, elected Best Model of the Year.
The Poker of Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in 'Póquer de ases' (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) thirty X-rays of writers who have passed through their literary life (and, in some cases, also by the other).
It does not do so in the predictable and fearsome genres (biographical likeness, life and work), but looking for something similar to the ignition core of the creator character.
The journey has its excitements and Vicent does not save shocks or illuminations.
In addition to exquisite pleasure, the book is a moving invitation to readings and re-readings.
Here I leave you a few moments.
Albert Camus wrote: “In his pages I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical impulse, the same as I felt without giving it a name: pleasure against destiny, morality without guilt, and innocence without any god.”
“Nihilist, allegorical Christian, wrote what he had in his blood, not in his intellect, between impotence and ignorance, with a stunning poetic humor, meaningless, like the blade of a knife that was about to kill him.”
About Graham Greene: "Our man was abducted by this woman with a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted of reaching heaven through the path of perdition."
About James Joyce: "The 'Ulises' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand meters summits of universal literature, which must be climbed through the north wall, from which the best climbers slip over and over again."
William Faulkner: "He was a rare guy.
Of himself, he once said that he was the heir to a county landowner and that he was the son of a black and crocodile.
“Both dreams were great.”
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer picked up the mad scream thrown from a bridge by that Munich character to take his echo to the bottom of the twentieth century in his literary form and did so on a journey fleeing from himself and invoking posterity with a violent speech to the worms."
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she kneeled down and prayed, 'Dear God, please make me stop writing like a woman.'
On Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were recorded these verses of Spenser: 'The dream after the effort,/ after the storm the harbor,/ the rest after the war,/ after life bitterly pleases death.'
About Virginia Wolf: “In the luggage she also brought her depressions.
The husband accepted normally that she told him that Edward VII was spying on her among the azaleas or that the birds sang in Greek.
It has never been the case of a man so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent went ahead of his madness.
About Pio Baroja: "What did Martin-Santos do but try to inoculate Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet try but pass Baroja by Faulkner's weapons?
What did Celah do but to take away the fame of that man, so that he might serve as his own pedestal?
Cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother, about 70 years old, was walking through our neighborhood in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years old passed by with her and our dog, a specimen of mestiza, rescued from the horse and with no more than six kilos of weight and, without a word of warning, they slapped the leg.
Our indignation is major because we do not find fun in a free aggression to a small, defenseless animal, which, by the way, was tied.
To this one must add the swelling that caused a lady who was walking quietly and who, when she incredulated these individuals, came to fear for their physical integrity, since an energetic who attacks an animal, is able to do the same with a woman, a child, an elder or, ultimately, with anyone who is more capable of himself.
The incident occurred at five in the afternoon on a Tuesday anyone in a traditionally quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
By the way, we filed a complaint in a nearby police station that we doubted it would be useful for a lot and not to generate susceptibilities, just to clarify that the cowardly killers were Spanish.
Anger has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what is happening among young people to find it fun to abuse a defenseless animal that gives us love, companionship and friendship for free.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people have been left.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the use of the helmet, mainly among the younger drivers, both entities reported today.
This initiative seeks to raise awareness of the importance of wearing the helmet, as it is the only protective element capable of avoiding head injuries or even death in the event of an accident while riding a motorcycle.
Michelin said the campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, that “beyond designing and manufacturing safer products every day” and said it also contributes to this goal through other pedagogical and informative actions.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmets on motorcycles, under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will have a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle workshops, with the aim of achieving maximum diffusion.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, as being a manufacturer of two-wheel tires, one of its main aims is to develop increasingly safe products.
Increase sales of light commercials
Almost two years later, the light commercial vehicle market begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 units registered in Spain in November represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, most importantly, represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline, according to figures from Anfac and Ganvam’s employers.
The good data, which is not oscillating, should be quarantined as the reference to the comparison – November 2008 – was particularly poor, with a 60% decline over the previous year.
As a result, despite the uptick in the last month, the registrations accumulated in these 11 months are 40% below those in the previous year.
Since January, 95,853 units have been sold, combined with all the vehicles that make up the crankcase of light commercial vehicles: derived from cars, pick-ups, vans, light trucks and light trucks/chassis.
Also, the clouds that most affect your demand have not disappeared, because although they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small and medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external financing.
In order to add to the restrictions imposed by the closed grip of bank credits, other factors such as the increase in unemployment levels or the persistence of the poor economic situation must be added.
In the face of this panorama and unlike the cars, aid for the purchase of the 2000E has recently served.
In addition to private individuals, autonomous companies and SMEs that are going to acquire a light commercial capacity of up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emission level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, the number of operations has been testimonial.
Yesterday, from Ganvam again they recalled the need to pay special attention to these vehicles and also to industrialists (camions and buses).
The sales association predicts a 2010 similar to the year ending, for which it calculates a 19% drop in sales (of cars and 4x4).
Emergency braking aid is now mandatory
As with ABS anti-lock braking and ESP stability control, emergency braking assistance systems will have to be a mandatory element in European cars.
In fact, they are already in all newly registered cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest a period of absence is fixed until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to increase the protection of pedestrians, although, by its way of working, it can also help to avoid many collisions.
The emergency braking assistant does what it does is to increase the pressure on the brakes in case of an emergency, which the system detects by the driver’s piston.
But it does not always keep that pressure up to the end.
According to a study conducted by car component manufacturer Bosch, a third of the drivers involved in an accident had not stepped on the brake before the collision and half of them did not take full advantage of the force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
Assistance intervention, on the other hand, requires the maximum braking system, reducing the distance the car uses to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with such elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided per year.
The reduction will be even greater — it is estimated that one in four accidents with damage to people would be avoided — when so-called smart emergency braking systems are popularized.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (through a radar or a camera) detects obstacles and alerts the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
In case it does not react, and even if the collision is inevitable, the device exerts maximum effort on the brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors delays plan for Opel until January
While Opel plant workers in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April – on April 8 probably – according to Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer needs to recover to conclude the plan.
What Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, wants is that each of the points of the plan has been previously agreed upon by the affected party.
And this can cause the final document to be submitted to workers first and then to the governments of the countries in which there are factories, to be delayed until the beginning of 2010.
Instead, GM says a decision on the sale of Saab should be made in the coming days.
It is no wonder that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the American manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to having contact with some potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but takes the choice of the Dutch sports carmaker Skyper, which is backed by the Russian group Converg.
In case there was no deal with any of them, GM could sell some of Saab’s assets to China’s Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year remains if it is not sold.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To develop its latest, expensive jewelry, Porsche engineers took the Boxster S as the basis and managed to lose no less than 80 pounds, which has left the scale at just 1,275 pounds.
This led them to refrain, first of all, from the automatic roof that has been replaced by one canvas with manual drive, with which 21 kilograms are saved; using aluminum doors such as those of the GT3, 'caen' other 15; removing the air conditioner, 13 liters; reducing the fuel tank by 19 kilograms, gaining from 7 liters, to 64 litres.
Finally, renouncing the CDR-30 audio system brought an additional six kilograms and changing the door snipers for one canvas, the remaining kilogram.
Although also offered with the double clutch PDK shift, the test was carried out on a unit with the six-speed manual box, mainly on California secondary roads, in mountain sections with really reversed tracks.
Their behavior can only be considered untouchable.
Weight reduction does not imply that the car does not pierce the asphalt with aplom.
Rather, it’s the opposite: for a long time we haven’t tested a model so small and lightweight that at the same time it conveys so much security in the turnover, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles in a short walk for the necessary time, until we tell him to squeeze, brake, recover and re-express his engine.
Thanks to its address, as communicative as it is, what we indicate with our hands on the steering wheel is what the car will do.
And it will do so with surgical precision.
Sound of the engine at will
The sound of your V6 boxer, with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is highly accomplished and can be enhanced with the 'sport' option and through a system that modifies the engine's bramiting, which was previously launched in the Panamera.
The ability to accelerate is brutal, either from a standstill or in recovery.
Suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we crossed with the Boxster Spyder was quite punishable, but the car digested the bakes well.
Electronic aids barely made an appearance throughout the journey; and that in some of the curves we find ice at dawn and gravel, already well in the morning.
In short, an ultralight car, one of the most fun to drive that one can on the market and that is more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will be on sale in February 2010, with a price of 70.831 euros.
"Bag Girl"
Intimate with Karl Lagerfeld, an image of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional 'starlette' of the 'maison' parades, the singer prodigies her bag face with as much clumsiness as her Chanel bags.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's a 'Bag Girl'.
The Baskonia gives itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral achieved a brilliant victory by 82-91 in his visit to the complicated field of the Maccabi Electra, despite the numerous lows with which Dusko Ivanovic’s team had, and thus he was in the lead of his group, following the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, who was the eighth best of his team.
The Victorian team was able to supply the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with large doses of involvement and collective work although it had to suffer to the end in order to win.
In addition, the great achievement from the perimeter, with 16 triples scored, had a lot to do with the final victory.
The game started face-to-face for the bluegranates, who were put from the start ahead on the marker.
That the first four baskets of the Victorians were from the perimeter already made it seem that they had jumped to the Israeli court with the hot dolls.
English and Teletovic were the main artists from 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second quarter was more of the same, but the team opted for the inner play of Barac and the work of Eliyahu, who was greeted with pranks and applause on the return to his home, to continue expanding his advantage to rest (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, although the splitter's 'less six' rating already made it seem that it was not going to be the best night of the Brazilian.
But the game, despite being in charge of the rest, was not decided much less and the Macabees wanted to remind the Victorians that on their pitch no one wins, and with 'Elijah's hand' tightening they managed to get into the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the 'yellows' turning the luminosity (50-49).
More inconveniences
Those of Ivanovic, wounded but not much less dead, needed to hit a pair of pitches to catch air, and in those came the machine gunner Mirza Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive triples and the help of English and Ribas returned the marker to a calming end (54-67), which the locals then took to the third quarter.
The Alaweses went out to leave their skin in the last partial and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already warned that they were not going to let anyone take away what they had deserved for the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team did not resign and tried to keep their team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated by flaws, Ivanovic's did not rush, defended well, and although the Israelis approached in the final minute (80–85), the game already had its owner and the victory was escaping Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
Injuries prevent fighting Unicaja
The Unicaja lost sharply in Greece to the Olympics and gave him the lead of Euroliga group B in a game marked by the lows of the boxers, especially in the indoor game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malagasy team was not frightened by the environment of the Peace and Friendship Pavilion and also not by the entity of the rival, perhaps of the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game shown in the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to dream. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two from the Omar Cook base and one from Guillem Rubio, illuminated the locals 12-18, minute 9.
The Olympiacos were surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the locals' arsenal in the indoor game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, gave a turn to the scorer 22-20, minute 13, when an action, cone of battle, between the two American bases plays the descaling Beverley and Williams ambombo.
The Greek team began to work showing its superiority within both areas, where the low injury of English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal faults of Carlos Jiménez, were lagging at the boxers.
Among the domestic players and Lithuanian midfielder Linas Kleizas, with their triples, increased the advantage 44-32, minute 19.
An Impossible Resurrection
The third period was very offensive with the Olympiacos, which despite the 19 losses, proved superior and even equalized the difference of the match played in Malaga 66-48, minute 27, which made the group’s leadership tamble.
The Unicaja tried to overcome the absences and the last low of Scottish pitcher Robert Archibald, injured during the match.
Despite all the inconveniences the Unicaja for Cook's direction and triples, and Lewis' contribution, left some hope 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible because the Olympics when it tightened and given its superiority in centimeters within the area proved imparable.
Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to retrace the average basketball 81-62, minute 37, and the Unicaja turned off, delivering the lead to the Olympiacos.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new Trovit application, the search engine with the highest number of classified ads for real estate, employment and engine in Spain.
The tool How Much Should You Charge? calculates the salaries of users from the more than 140,000 job offers Trovit has in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where they must enter their profession, years of experience, age and city where they want to work.
In the week that the application is running, the search engine has detected that in general the Spanish worker "feels badly paid", explained in a statement Trovit's product manager, Albert Ribera.
According to the data available by Trovit from its search engines in the United Kingdom and France, the Spanish are the worst-paid.
A British computer programmer charges <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>45,226 gross annually and a French one, <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>31,059, compared to the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>24,000 that a Spanish receives.
In the same way, a driver charges 34,247 euros net annually in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst-paid work in Spain is the work of waiter, with 11.592 euros net annually; followed by the worker, with 14.725 euros; and the worker, with 15.667 euros.
The most sought after jobs on the network in the last three months are driver, half-time jobs and social worker jobs.
Brazil sets date for Zelaya's departure
The Brazilian Government has set a deadline for the stay of Manuel Zelaya at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deputy president must leave the diplomatic legacy no later than January 27, 2010, when he would officially end his term.
Francisco Catunda, head of business of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that “Mel” knows he must leave before that date of the embassy, where he has been a refugee since September 21.
“He is aware that he has to leave on January 27, when his term ends, he has to look for another destination.”
The broadcaster also quoted the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: “My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government,” Zelaya said by phone.
Following the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this same week he attempted to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation was finally frustrated by Zelaya’s rejection of the political asylum condition that the “de facto” government chaired by Roberto Micheletti intended to impose on him.
Thank you so much
After the days of wine and roses since last spring when asset inflation has been the dominant tone in the markets, again uncertainty reappears in the markets, which should not be surprising as it is their natural state, in an environment where agents make decisions about the future by uncertain nature.
The medicine used by central banks to stabilize markets was to monetize debt with direct asset purchases and indirectly giving liquidity-free bar to near-zero rates for financial institutions to buy off assets.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have practically ended and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, they are beginning to throw some sand on the gears as the ECB did with its auction next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to maintain the economic recovery without such heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of stocks and corporate bond differentials has risen again, although they remain far from the paranormal levels they reached earlier this year.
States were forced to socialize private risk and public debt is being affected again.
Again there is a flight to quality and the U.S., Japan and Germany have been the refuge chosen by investors, provoking an expansion of the differentials of eurozone countries with respect to Germany.
Spain had barely been affected by this instability episode but in that came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new downward review of the Kingdom of Spain rating.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is not wrong to stifle moral risk advocates who were attempting to re-create awareness posts on those responsible for global economic policy for slowing down the destructive effects of credit restriction on job destruction, when what would have to be done is to decrement a new degree of decency.
However, what Dubai paints is a tribal struggle between the Emirates to recompose power in the Emirates and what Greece has seen before.
A government that hides public deficit, elections, and a new government that pulls the blanket.
Prodi did so in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for the Ecofin to save Hungary from a breach of its external payments at the beginning of the year and to allow a euro member country to breach its commitments.
What makes sense is that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to make its citizens accountable for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are facing a transitional risk premium normalization episode, after some excess in leveraged positions, it would be within what was expected.
In the case of Spain, while our public debt differentials are expanding just like European corporate bonds, we should not worry.
If European differentials decrease and ours continues to expand, then this would be a Spanish idiosyncratic risk.
Standard & Poor's is an anecdote. When our advanced indicators are forcing most study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and to revise upwards their scenario for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, they return to load with a Japanese scenario for their life expectancy of the Spanish economy.
Again, it has all the paint that will be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although at the moment "prudence, friend driver".
Related Sectors
The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies in which the energy strategy of Spain is discussed these days in the next two decades.
After his speech, followed by that of the president of Natural Gas-Phenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press a brush of what he had put forward in the closed-door subcommittee.
For Iberdrola’s president, Spain needs to invest <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 billion by 2020 and another <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion between that date and 2030, as long as nuclear power plants remain open today in operation.
If not, the necessary investments will not be 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
Iberdrola believes that in the next decade, investments should not be aimed at increasing capacity in generation, but in distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020 onwards, the issue will change and power will have to be increased.
It focuses on both gas and coal plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, renewable energies.
In this case, it considers that 18,000 new MW are needed, yes, with other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the draft Sustainable Economy Act that the government has just passed is in line with what its company has been claiming, did not want to make blood with the royal decree to encourage national coal consumption, which contradicts climate change policies.
In his opinion, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this regard, despite the "punctual" measures, as the president of Iberdrola called them.
Whatever the case, Galán considers that investment decisions, although they are long-term, should begin to be taken already because they are delayed in maturity and a stable remuneration framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins 'handling' of Aer Lingus in ten airports
Ferrovial’s subsidiary for airport services on the ground, Swissport, will play the preferred partner role of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for freight services at ten European airports in which it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are some of the highlights.
The agreement, of which the economic terms have not exceeded, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a collaboration protocol to create the Innovation Center for Intelligent Infrastructure
The alliance envisages an investment of 20 million by 2012, of which 50% corresponds to Ferrovial.
One of the centre’s tasks will be to investigate energy efficiency on highways and airports.
Australia’s first highway race with Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona lugna for its first highway in concession in Australia, where it already works as an energy company and water manager.
The work at stake is that of a tunnel valued at <0x24>1.7 billion (about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.047 billion).
The French Bouygues and German Hochtief are their rivals.
A 5-kilometre tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the East Coast, has become the closest option for Acciona to settle in the country as a construction and motorway dealer.
The City Council wants to keep it ready by the end of 2014
After opting for public-private collaboration (PPP) to carry out the project, in a business plan sponsored by Ernst & Young, the Administration already has a final list of candidates to do with the work and exploit the fee.
Expecting to present their offerings next May, the planned investment amounts to <0x24>1.7 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.047 billion) and in the final phase compete three consortiums with a notable presence of European builders.
The group named Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish in Liza, and its colleagues are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian constructors, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground works.
The Northern Direct consortium plays against the Acciona team, with the presence of British Laing O'Rourke, Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and French builder group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium to pass the consortium is the so-called LBRJV, where they share the capital of the Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, in turn participated by ACS), the local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the civil works-specialized gala firm Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises big works and privatizations, but it leads to a clear difficulty of entry if it is not through the acquisition of a local construction firm.
A strategy that has been followed by the cited Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and that continues to be a pending subject for the Spanish giants in the sector.
Only ACS has achieved a position in that market through its 30% stake in Hochtief, the owner of the aforementioned Leighton.
Millionaire Assets
It operates a geographical area of maximum importance for the sector, in which it already has a prominent presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination business.
Among other assets, it has its largest wind farm, the Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies responsible for lifting and managing the Adelaide wind farm, with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention is now to consolidate those two areas and to leverage synergies to enter the construction and operation fields of infrastructure.
The underground toll road, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and called Northern Link (north link), is called to connect the Toowong western highway with the toll road at Kelvin Grove (see map) along the 5-kilometre highway with the toll road.
The schedule set by the Administration sets the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of the works in December of next year.
Although this payment step would open to traffic in the last months of 2014, the work is not expected to be completed until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two tracks per direction, an electronic charging system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland will contribute <0x24>500 million (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>308 million) to its funding.
Brisbane already offers business to Hochtief
Australia continues to bear notable fruit to Hochtief, who announced yesterday that it had obtained a contract with the government valued at 154 million.
ACS will enable, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the national broadband network infrastructure with fiber-optic cable.
The event will provide fast internet access to 400,000 people and give German jobs for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has passed the 27-storey King George Tower construction project in the Australian city of Brisbane. The works were still to begin and Hochtief has closed sales at 129 million.
Already in the UK, specifically in Manchester, Laing O’Rourke will share the construction and operation of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment will be <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>75 million.
FCC awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its Alpine subsidiary, has been awarded the construction of a 2.1-kilometre tunnel for a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>64.5 million Slovenian highway.
The firm obtains this contract days after the expansion of the Bosruck Tunnel (Austria) by 130 million.
In this way, Alpine reinforces its expertise in tunnel construction.
The start of the work is scheduled for the beginning of 2010 and will be extended for 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore is awarded Renfe's advertising
Renfe has awarded the advertising and marketing services over the next two years to the agency Mrs. Rushmore for approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 million annually, the railway operator said.
The contract includes the possibility of two 12-month extensions each. Mrs. Rushmore has been selected from the 16 agencies that submitted to the competition by Renfe of which four remained finalists, including TBWA who was responsible for creativity in the last three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be in charge of the design and production of the campaigns.
France Télécom fined <0x24>63 million for curbing competition
The competition regulator in France has imposed a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>63 million on France Télécom for anti-competitive conduct in the country’s Caribbean regions.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition in fixed and mobile telephony with the signing of exclusive agreements, pricing plans and loyalty programs to consumers outside of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state company accumulates more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>560 million in fines since 1994 for putting up with its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday has in fact been increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and that it is therefore recurring.
App Stores
On the other hand, the French company’s mobile subsidiary has followed the footsteps of other operators and has opened an online app store, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
In principle, the Orange app store will be active in France and the UK.
We will have to wait until 2010 for it to arrive in other countries, such as Spain.
Playing the Champions has reported 476.4 million to Madrid and Barça since its origin
The Champions League has become a source of revenue for clubs since it was born in 1992.
Both Real Madrid and Barcelona have entered 476.4 million since then, making them the third and fifth club to win the most money in the competition.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings glory, it is also one of the main sources of revenue for the big clubs.
The competition has allocated <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5,362.5 million to the 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) who have participated in the event since the tournament was created in the 1992/93 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have come out very well from this division.
The white club has been the third on the continent to have made the most money to participate, and the only one, alongside AC Milan, to have won the trophy three times.
The Catalan, the current champion and the last winner of the extinct European Cup in 1992, is the fifth in the ranking.
The list is led by Manchester United and Munich Bayern, the two teams who also made more money to participate in the previous Champions League.
And that, despite losing both to the Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country to have achieved the most money through the Champions, despite having achieved more titles than any other (five, by the four of Italy, the three of England and the two of Germany).
Distribution (distribution)
This apparent paradox is explained by UEFA’s complicated money-sharing procedure.
For this exercise, the body chaired by Michel Platini expects to enter 1,090 million for the Champions League.
Of this money UEFA will dedicate 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the previous qualifying round (including Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million just for being there, plus another 550,000 euros for each game they competed.
There is also a bonus for winning (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>800,000) and for empatching (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400,000 for each team). The octave-finalists will receive three million each; the eight quarter-finalists, 3.3 million.
The last four will be 4 million each.
The champion will win 9 million, compared to the finalist’s 5.2 million.
Thus, in terms of fixed payments, a club will earn at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
Barça, on the other hand, was packed 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But there are also variable payments, for which 337.8 million are allocated.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish is one of the main, and has four seats allocated.
The champion of the previous year remains with 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other party will be paid according to the number of matches played in this year’s edition.
New Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos
The New Rumasa Group on Thursday unveiled the details of the offer to buy shares with which it seeks to acquire a cap of between 25% and 29.9% of Sos’ capital.
A percentage that does not force you to launch a public procurement offer (OPA) for all securities.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.5025 per share that would be disbursed in 10 years and that would be reimbursed with an interest for such an annual 1% delay.
Yesterday Sos shares closed at 1.85 euros; therefore, the offer of Nueva Rumasa valued the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the actual valuation of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 advisers.
The Jerez group gives a 15-day deadline for shareholders to communicate their interest in selling securities.
The CNMV said it had not been informed of the offer, even though the Ruiz Mateos company claimed it had contacted the regulator.
If done, the disbursement would reach 611.7 million when Sos capitalization is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure his address.
In an attempt to stay out of possible purchase offers and the courtrooms of their former managers, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar, announced the election of Maria Luisa Jorda as director of internal audit.
A decision that makes her the first woman to occupy a high position in the food company.
This is a newly created position that will depend directly on the chairman of the group.
And it is not free from controversy, as the company remains immersed in the legal battle for the alleged deviation of more than 230 million from Sos to Salazar societies.
In fact, it cannot be ruled out that over the next few months Sos reveals new discrepancies of funds
On the credit to the Salazars, the former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and <0xC3><0x81>ngel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) said yesterday in the National Audience that they approved the transfer of 212 million without knowing their destiny.
The CNMV authorizes the exclusion opa of Paternina that presented Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) approved the exclusion policy presented by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on October 9.
The supervisory body has explained that it authorizes this operation by understanding that its terms are in line with the current rules and consider the contents of the explanatory leaflet submitted after the amendments introduced on 2 December.
The CNMV has specified that the offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550,008 shares of Federico Paterina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, representing 8.95% of its share capital, which is composed of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao Stock Exchanges.
It has also explained that 5,592,778 million shares have been immobilized, which will not be transmitted in any way until the end of the offer, of which it has specified that the price has been set by Federico Paterina, in accordance with the provisions of the current regulations.
New Tools to Peripheral Cars
In these days of accidents and accidents, not only car workshops win.
Every day thousands of cars that have suffered an accident are towed to a workshop, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and what will be the cost of repair.
No sinister is the same, and calculating the cost of parts and working time can be a long and complicated task.
Calculating the cost of a repair of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and workmanship, can take two or three hours.
Instead, with the support of the latest computer tools, it would be a minor issue.
That’s why almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
Service providers and solutions for accident assessment and maintenance are dedicated to collecting the information that manufacturers provide them, then elaborate it and offer it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the American group Solera, is the leading firm; 80% of the ratings are made with its products.
The other firms competing in the field of assessment and information processing tools on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data supplied by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, in Spain they work with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with the information in different formats.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, to the point that in the last five years more versions, variants and engines have been released than in the previous fifteen.
As soon as a new car enters the market, these companies start working.
It is a very difficult task, because you have to catalog each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and introduce its price.
In addition, of each model a "smart" graphic image is made where different parts of tourism can be "pinned".
If it is a ventamass model, the work can be ready in a week if the process goes very fast.
If you are a minority car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information about 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models there are information about Porsche, but not from Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
As for the mobile park it circulates, it exceeds 99%.
To carry out the work of documentation and database development, Audatex has eight centers worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them is specialized in specific brands.
The National Headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>90 million annually in the development of these databases.
2.5 million data are included each month, and customers receive updates every two days.
The elaboration of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer various products.
The most frequent use focuses on repair and maintenance, but depending on which countries there are also tools for handling dewatering parts or for calculating the venous or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of used in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but in the United States.
In view of the products Audatex offers, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support that industry professionals can provide.
This company offers ten different tools, being the star product AudaPlus, the standard disaster assessment solution, aimed at experts.
Includes cars, motorcycles and light or heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the estimated repair times by the manufacturer or the paint bars.
This tool is paid according to the use, for each valuation.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, a maximum of ten times a month.
Then each insurance company, which performs thousands of expertises, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it came out of the assembly line only with its frame number.
AudaGlass focuses on the moons of vehicles, and AudaSustains is an open service to the professional online sector that allows you to climb for vehicles declared to be a total sinister.
Its statistical service is very useful to identify trends, perform geodemographic analysis or know the deviations by model brands.
You can study, for example, how many models of a particular brand have gone through the workshop due to defects or how many have suffered serious accidents in a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
It commercializes, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for assessing damage, failure or maintenance of the car.
The Gt Rating Guide is your historical reference product in the market.

Internet auction of accidented cars
Last October, the Solera group bought Autoonline, an online platform for the sale of cars as motorcycles or special vehicles.
The transaction amounted to a disbursement of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>59.5 million for 85% of the company’s capital, which could be extended next year to the remaining 15%.
The aim of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing an immense international market.
This evaluation and purchase service is aimed exclusively at industry professionals, such as insurance companies, experts, leasing companies, workshops, dealers and professional sellers who must register before they begin to carry out operations.
The platform was established in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.
3,000 ads are managed daily and about 100 new ads are included in the Spanish market every day.
Under Spanish law, a car whose frame number has been dropped cannot be re-circulated, but can be used as a replacement for certain parts that are not damaged.
Cars with historical value can be high even if they have been given low after a shaky management.
Workshop budget in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex ensures that the user gets a budget in just four steps: identifying the vehicle, looking for the spare parts, creating a budget and generating a budget.
Ease of use is an essential conditioner for these systems, especially to convince older professionals that to a greater or lesser extent they are more reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, which are 666 cars, 109 all-terrain, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, to use it you need a computer with an internet connection.
Once the model to be repaired by its frame number is identified, a real graphic image of the model in question is displayed and then the necessary replacement is selected.
The user can include variables such as labor price, charges or discounts, and then can print the budget to deliver to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a rating tool like AudaPlus, but rather a catalog of references.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros per year, which the customer can finance.
The company Audatex is currently working to make these three-dimensional images.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with very good eyes, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it around to see the inside face.
