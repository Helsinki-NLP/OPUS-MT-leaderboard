What is he doing? The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD in Prague does not know Voldemort or the sugar mill
The new city councillors of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD will have to overcome a certain language barrier in order to understand their old colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the Delegation.
The journal Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz members of the new council of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD "tested" as they know the notoriously introduced slang that was formed in the town hall during the last years when Prague was ruled by the current coalition partners.
The coded dictionary, introduced by a Prague politician during the previous era of Mayor Paul Bém, describes some of the most famous characters, situations and causes in the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new council does not understand the concepts known.
At least he says so.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I'm a novice in Prague politics," Lukas Kauk<0xC3><0xBD>, the cultural advisory dictionary, responded to the test of "Kmotrovsky".
As far as the political veteran is concerned, the councillor Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina reacted in the same way.
For example, the term "golf hole".
"It's the only expression of what you're presenting to me that I sometimes use."
"Otherwise I don't recognize the snake in general."
From the dictionary, which Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz published in June this year before the ODS election congress, the editorial selected six examples, mostly those notoriously associated with the Prague magistrate.
The socialists were to explain the concepts of "Voldemort", "the biggest golf hole in Prague", "going to the candy shop", "bear necks", "the betrayal of the capital" and "bearing".
Three of the councillors agreed with the quiz, and the fourth - Antonín Weinert, who is going to head the Prague school in the future - promised the interview at first, but later did not receive the phone.
The fifth councillor, Peter Dolínek, refused the straight test.
"I don't solve these issues at all, and the way civil democrats play, I won't judge."
"I am now deciding how we will understand ourselves as part of our programs," he said.
As it has already been said, municipality Lukash Kauksky would not have understood in the title above that he is talking about the influential entrepreneur and friend of the speaker Bém Roman Janu<0xC5><0xA1>ka.
"Voldemort" tells Kaucké nothing, and the only term he correctly predicted in the exam is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"It's the Blanka tunnel," says Kauksky, and immediately adds, "But I know it from the newspaper."
"I'm going to have to pay for some language course," he jokes.
The golf hole is then decrypted as a Blanka tunnel by not only killer Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, but also environmental adviser Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD>.
Both social democrats then know who Voldemort really is, and Lukas Plachém is also familiar with where to find this character - guessing the meaning of the term "going to the candy shop".
"I mean, it means going to some Prague business," Plach<0xC3><0xBD> is close to the dissolution that it is the headquarters of Janou<0xC5><0xA1>k companies.
According to B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, he recalled that knowledge was drawn from newspapers rather than using such a dictionary.
In social democracy, according to the frequency of the test, there is no similar run-down dictionary of slang terms.
"I've been chatting with colleagues, but it looks like we don't really have anything like that."
"We call ourselves names, sometimes abbreviations and names are used," says the president of the Prague SSD Petr Hulínsk<0xC3><0xBD>, whom the parties nickname Hulda.
“I was called B<0xC5><0x99>íz at school, but I don’t know if my colleagues call me that,” admits Karel B<0xC5><0x99><0xC4><0x99>zina.
The name of the site has been tested and works.
The council of Weinert is a grandfather or a less friendly grandfather, a representative of Miroslav Poche, who, before the election, warned of fraud in sponsoring the party, has a nickname "Igrá<0xC4><0x8D>ek" with some colleagues.
The nicknames are also the only thing that social democrats in the intra-partisan discourse allow.
Hulínsk<0xC3><0xBD> says Huldu does not like to hear, but Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz noted another nickname of this Prague president.
The "Doctor of Obstetrics Law" recalls that Petr Hulínsk<0xC3><0xBD> earned his degree in JUDr. at the Bratislava Police Academy.
Government wants to curb torture of witches, publishes brochure
Women declared witches in Burkina Faso have several common characteristics.
Rather, they belong to the older generation, they cannot get involved in work, for example, for health reasons, are free and do not have children.
The one who becomes a witch is sent into isolation so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
"Man, this destiny is very rarely attained."
“Young healthy women don’t even judge themselves because they help at work and give birth to children,” describes a nun who takes care of more than a hundred women who have been expelled from their communities in the West African capital of Burkina Faso.
The local government has now decided to take action against an unusual "social measure".
She issued an information booklet to help limit witch hunting.
It's got a hook.
“More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso cannot read,” noted the Die Standard newspaper’s written lighting downside.
Accusations of witchcraft are common in other African countries as well.
In Ghana, neighbouring Burkina Faso, 27-year-old Amma Hemmah died last week after three women and two men tortured her, pouring oil and burning her.
The BBC reported the case.
The perpetrators claim that it was an unhappy match of circumstances.
According to their version, the woman was burned with oil, which is used for ritual anointing.
He said he grew up after the group wanted to "remove the evil spirit" from the woman.
Isolation of "witches" supports people regardless of the level of education achieved.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a twenty-four-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso: “The food of human souls has always been a danger,” he said.
While in Burkina Faso the government is trying to calm down the witch hunt, in Gambia last year the president himself took part.
"Gambian President Jammi, after the death of his aunt, launched an extensive hunt for a witch who was supposed to participate in her death and try to kill the president himself with black magic."
"He called for help the Shamans from nearby Guinea, who, accompanied by police, soldiers and the president's personal guards, violently drove randomly selected men and women from Gambia villages to the president's farm in Kanilai," Amnesty International said in a statement.
On the farm, people had to drink herbal medicine with hallucinogenic effects, which also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two prisoners did not survive their stay on the farm.
After international pressure, almost a thousand prisoners were eventually released from prison.
Bakal's tenant: Topi in the rocks, higher rent signed
The older undersea man walked out of the door of the client center of RPG company "uhlobaron" Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Bakaly, the largest private owner of rented apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under his armor he carried the case and in it the new lease agreement to three apartments: his own, his daughters, and his son, who is in charge of the punishment.
All three of them were deregulations.
Instead of 3500 per month, the son will pay for the 2<0x2B>1 second category apartment 4100 kronor from next year.
"And there is no warm water there, and the petrama must melt," points the man with his finger in his son's new contract, whose signature he has full power.
"But I signed it," he explains half angry and half resigned.
BytyOKD.cz, which the new terms of rental have been described as "incorrect and immoral," advises tenants not to sign new contracts and wait until December 7, when it will publish instructions on how to proceed against them.
But the man just has his hands on it.
"One says it, the other says it," he whispered.
Ostrava becomes a major deregulation laboratory.
After the New Year, the vast majority of apartments that still have non-market rent in the Czech Republic await.
Currently.cz therefore decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The Haví<0xC5><0x99>ovská käkárna RPG is one of four in Ostrava and is already full on Tuesday at nine in the morning.
Right next to the door is a security guard from the security agency and a trigger device at it.
"Nájem 2011", lights a special button on his touch screen.
One touch and the paper with the number comes out of the machine.
You can't even read "157" and your digit is already ringing on a large screen under the ceiling of the waiting room.
In half a second, you're on your turn.
After a while, an older married couple comes to ask for the rent, but the waiter's waiter's waiting room is obviously not concerned with new rentals at all.
Most people have come to solve common problems like they used to do - requests for repairs, insurance events and the like.
Letters with new lease agreements are sent to the post offices in Ostrava by the tenants of most of the 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio since about mid-November.
RPG Apartments in their letters suggests an increase in rents of 15 to 38 percent.
A special transfer to new rentals was opened at the customer center on November 18.
“It’s been running for over a week, so it’s just in the running,” the employee said after a moment of hesitation when the client introduces himself as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakal’s former mining apartments are a local inflammatory topic.
Before the elections, he was quite hailed by the Vice-President of Parliament and Ostrava relative Lubomír Zaorálek of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, and even now he is filled with local newspapers.
"Twenty years later, I want a new floor."
“They didn’t even replace my toilet board,” the man said in the introduction.
Most of the time, according to the employees, retirees come to see if they will get a rental discount if they sign in time, as the RPG promises them in a special offer.
The other tenants, who will sign the new contract by 15 December, will also receive a half discount on the February rent.
The "deregulation" section of Haví<0xC5><0x99>ov, however, is definitely not burdened with questions.
"Of yesterday's 360 clients there were only about forty to fifty people due to the lease for 2011," the employee estimates.
The RPG, on the website and on its walls, proposes individual contract negotiations where necessary.
However, if both parties do not agree on a lease, it will have to be determined by an independent court.
“It’s not about threats, but about information about the only possible and entirely legitimate legal process,” RPG said on its website.
"There will be no trial here," thinks one of the RPG staff members of the apartment, and the man on the street in front of the client center partially blames her for it.
“I have 13,000 pensions and I have 5,000 left to eat, I don’t have to judge myself,” he says.
After all, the workshops will soon disappear.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them in the media not to sign, so people are probably waiting," he thinks.
The regulation of rents ends in most Czech Republic with the New Year 2011 and according to RPG Apartment, their increase is an economic necessity.
“The existing lease still does not reach even the amount necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund,” says Pavel Klime<0xC5><0xA1>, director of the residential portfolio of RPG Byty, that the angered tenants are compensated by the neglect of the housing fund, according to the owners of the houses.
In the five years between 2005 and 2010, RPGs could have invested <0x24>4 billion in rents in apartments, and <0x24>5.2 billion in the four years from 2011 to 2014.
The large screen hanging at the ceiling opposite to the padded seats of the haví<0xC5><0x99>ov checkroom for the time being repeats several red highlighted information.
"The increase in rent in 2011 by 15% and less concerns 31,200 apartments, which is more than 90% of RPG apartments."
"And it will always be at most 7.50 CZK per square meter and a month," it will appear on the screen.
Only 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio will increase the rent by 38 percent.
"In these cases, this is an increase from an extremely low amount of 19.66 CZK per square meter," RPG notes.
For 2,600 apartments, the rental will remain the same next year.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation will not exceed rent by jump, but will be deployed to four to eight years.
In addition, it adds a further commitment: all the money from the increase in rent (see graph) will give the company back to the apartments, mainly to heat savings - new windows and insulation.
Preferably, they should be given to people who sign an agreement to increase rents.
The offices include a nursery, the architects understood
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
No one would expect him to also hide a mini-school with everything he belongs to - with colorful walls, inventive furniture, a bunch of toys and even a miniature playground on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, the children of Arch.Design’s employees can visit it.
Arch.Design, the project-architectonic company, from whose studios came a number of important Brno buildings, had the space for its company mini-school since the first drawings of the Avriopoint building.
She employs almost 90 people, mostly of the age of a baby boomer, and cares for women designers and architects to get back to work quickly.
Along with the possibility of shortened commitments, the school is a benefit that Arch.Design offers to its employees as part of the social program.
Builders and architects have the opportunity to combine hard work with childcare.
The mini-school was invented by the Arch.Design employees and with the support of the management, they managed to obtain a grant from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company’s mini-school is funded by the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme Human Resources and Employment and the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to grant funding (subsidy of 2, 8 million CZK) they were able to purchase equipment and equipment and provide qualified staff and operations for two years.
After exhaustion of the financial grant (2 years), Arch.Design has an obligation to operate a mini-school for 3 years at its own expense.
The preparation of the project took one year and the grant application was significantly assisted by Economy Rating.
Care is provided by qualified staff, children are taken care of throughout the day by the nurse and teacher of M<0xC5><0xA1>, so children can go to the nursery without age limit, yet most of them are 3 years of age.
Since it is a "miniskole", there can be only 5 children present at the same time, but more of them are replaced during the day.
The operation of the kindergarten is flexible according to the needs of parents and children of all employees have the same right to use the kindergarten regardless of the hierarchy of position in the company.
Although it is an individual education and care, the program load in the mini-school is comparable to the framework of pre-school education.
Not only do children play here, but they are also assured of quality teaching - from basic learning to preparation to school benches, English is also taught.
The class is equipped not only with toys, stimulating games, but also a computer that children can use.
The presence of young children directly in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can check their child at any time and avoid stressful situations with delayed picking up children from schools away from their parents’ workplace.
Parents make more productive use of their working hours.
It is no wonder that there is a naturally loyal relationship between an employee and an employer.
Arch.Design has thus been among the Czech companies, which offer a significant benefit in recruiting new employees, are family-friendly and through this program has strengthened personal marketing.
The house of bones fascinates even after 100 years. Look at the interiors from Gaudí
The roof looks like the back of an ancient pond, the staircase resembles the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are open fish mouth.
This is the house of Casa Batlló in Barcelona by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
From the local house thanks to its organic shapes he earned the nickname House from bones.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stone, fragments of tiles and mosaics, a facade reminiscent of skulls and ubiquitous soft curves, all of which are typical for the secession of Antoni Gaudí.
The periphery of the house plays out dream lines, gentle colors and textures reminiscent of nature and animals.
With detailed observation, you can see geometry, rhythm and precisely thought-out order.
At night, the entire facade of the house sounds even more dramatic, it is illuminated so that the impression of brightness of colors is further enhanced.
Coiling and twisting of shapes appear to the same extent in the interiors.
Wood in wool copies window frames, shelves, decorative elements of the door, hooks and rods.
The Batlló House, which is located in the Eixample district on the busy shopping street Passeig de Gràcia No. 43, was built by the renovation of the house from 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
Reconstruction took two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, originally insisted on the demolition of the old building and the construction of a completely new one, but soon took Gaudí’s idea of an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
Casa Batlló, however, was not designed by Antoni Gaudí himself.
He worked with architect Josep Maria Jujol.
It was on its design board that decorations were created for the representative apartment of the owner of the property and the use of mosaics on the facade.
A number of other artists and artists worked on the facade.
The joint work on the designs of Casa Batlló started a successful collaboration between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudí's Casa Milá and Güell Park, in which Gaudí's other works are included.
From the locals, the house of the bay after its completion earned the nickname "House of bones" thanks to its organic shapes.
Others called it a "living house" because of the specific mechanism of opening windows.
It is also said that at the top of the building is depicted the sword of St. George, patron of Catalonia.
Hidden religious motifs also contain other sculptural elements of the building.
Gaudí proposed a unique central heating system with ventilation ducts and typical chimneys for his time.
Bizarre may seem to be their forty-five-degree slope.
During Gaudí’s creation, he did not comply with the construction regulations of that time and did not allow himself to be bound by them.
Although at the beginning of the construction he was granted a building permit from the city, the data he provided on the planned reconstruction was so heavy that two years later on completion, the city council was devastated and requested correction.
For example, the council was disturbed by the fact that the building also interfered with the pillars in the public corridor.
On the contrary, it was never repaired: only fifteen days after the challenge of the district, Josep Batlló requested (and successfully obtained) permission to rent the two highest floors of the building.
The owner himself moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a communal living room and on the third floor a bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented by jewelry.
The entire six-storey house runs across the staircase, which can be reached up to the rooftop terrace itself.
The main elements of the reconstruction were the abolition of all the right angles and straight lines and their replacement with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of connecting spaces.
The social part can be fully connected by opening the salon doors and a larger society can communicate comfortably together without at the same time maintaining the privacy necessary for more intimate conversations.
In addition to the new façade, the house with Gaudí rebuilt also received an unconventional roof and two additional floors.
Gaudí’s play is also impressive with light, blue and white glazed tiles, with which the inner courtyard is covered, and candles.
The game of two colors provides maximum light in all floors of the house.
Simply bet on the principle that white reflects light more than dark, which, on the contrary, absorbs the sun’s rays.
Casa Batlló, which was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2005, can be visited by anyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and honorable apartment available to the public.
The owners decided to take this step only in 2002, on the occasion of the centenary of the birth of the famous creator.
They stayed for the tours because they found that it was a very profitable business and, in addition, the tours expanded on common and loft spaces, including the roof terrace.
Entrance to the monument is definitely not negligible, it makes 16.50 euros and students, pensioners, groups and tourist card holders have a 20% discount.
The sum significantly exceeds the price of entry to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to taste the true atmosphere of the house with dragon towers, you need to quickly chat with some of the gangster's inhabitants and visit it directly at home.
How to choose mattresses and grids: women have different requirements than men
Not the hosy frame of the bed, but the quality of the leaning area, i.e. mattresses and grilles, give the foundation of a really good bed.
However, they must be complemented harmoniously to suit a particular user.
When choosing, it decides a lot of things, from weight, height, age, health status and gender of the owner.
Also important is the type of interior in which mattresses and grids are painted.
A typical example?
For example, for weekend cottages, where they do not melt regularly, latex mattresses are not suitable, because they "heat" slowly.
In addition, they have a significantly higher weight than the standard polyurethane mattress.
It is necessary to turn them around on a regular basis.
Because if they don’t have a lot of ventilation channels in the core, and are still lying on a hard board, they retain moisture: there might be a fungus under them.
When choosing, the habit also decides.
Those who have spent a long time abroad, where very high mattresses with a softening layer are often used, will hardly feel good on the low and hard surface.
"Maybe all the hockey players who came back from the NHL have complained to me that they won't sleep here."
"On their separate shoulders, hips and hips they needed a mattress with a softening layer of lined foam."
“Such are recommended for people with diabetes who have a nervous system disorder, so they misreceive ‘information’ from joints and skin,” explains Sylva Hadamczik, who specializes in furnishings.
For many hockey players, as well as other customers, the mattress with a line of foam was therefore scanned years ago.
"Today it's okay, we need a suitable mattress for Tempur, Italian Magniflex, but also Czech Tropico."
You don’t have to be an NHL fighter to appreciate the foam line.
This "miracle" works simply.
It optimizes its stiffness and shape according to the heat absorbed or adapts to your warm body.
Nothing pressures you, you won't turn around like after a hard game at night.
You're just gonna sleep better.
Linen foam also serves as a protection against slopes.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add the length of the leg to your height, which is about 21 to 34 cm.
Men and women with a height of about 180 cm need a bed of 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be 90 cm for a double bed, hence 180 cm together.
For separate beds, for example for singles, at least 120 to 140 cm is recommended.
For comfort and a possible visit.
"Otherwise, the rule for the width of the bed is simple: when lying on the back, you should have your hands comfortably slightly hooked in the elbow," advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, a characteristic chemistry officer of the Characteristics of socks and decorators, who deals with the problems of healthy sleep and ergonomics of school furnishings.
In the case of a double bed, everyone needs their own grid and mattress, but here be careful when buying to match the heights of the mattress.
Otherwise, it will be nothing but mounting the grilles to different heights, but this may not work for you with every bed frame.
Foam mattresses should have a height of at least 14 cm, types with a spring bone of at least 15, of which at least three centimeters count on the molding and baking layer.
"When touching your hands or touching the mattress, you should definitely not feel the springs," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a certain type of grille.
Fully furnished beds, when the mattresses and the base are like siamese twins, have nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses are poorly ventilated, it is not possible to wash their blankets, which is already common today.
And since we usually sweat 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat overnight, it is clear that after five to seven years, the mattress will begin to resemble a large (and clogged) mesh.
For this reason, experts reject advertising slogans about the lifespan of mattresses up to 25 years, or even lifetime guarantees.
But everything has its own.
Therefore, advice from vendors: for mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm of hygiene and work, do not give up a removable coating, but rather add a mattress protector that you can easily remove and wash.
Even though mattresses are usually produced today, they are scattered throughout the circuit, so after unfolding we get two parts (for washing and the size of the dishwasher very important!), yet the manipulation of larger types (and one person) could be made with a swivel in the joint of the attachment.
Do you have a hardboard in bed instead of a barbecue?
Never! Never!
Maximum on the bed destined for visits for one night.
However, keep the board (if it no longer has) ventilation holes and use a mattress with a spring bone and a height of at least 15 cm with springs in bags (with it.Taschenfederkern) and a baking layer.
Polyurethane mattress does not belong to such a base.
Latex or sandwich mattresses (e.g. a combination of latex and coconut) will be suitable for non-storing lamellas grids with 14 to 18 lamellas, but you will always be paid for grids with more lamellas, 28 or more, where lamellas in the area of the beard are doubled and can be regulated here.
Lamellas grids do not include spring bone mattresses, because they do not respond to positioning.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the lamella, the so-called shoulder stool can also be used.
This is a special grip of the lamellae, which allows you to press, or even bend, the lamellae so that the shoulder of the lamellae is quite "colored".
For men who have "arms all over the back" is definitely an important thing.
It is even remembered by the manufacturers of mattresses, who in "Spanish" began to use the softening zone just in the shoulder area.
Women also remember - they give them a softer surface in the hips.
For the most demanding customers are designed wing or plate grilles with so-called multi-purpose drilling.
The pressure is split into several points and the voltage is reduced.
However, be careful when you use the right mattress and grid the wrong pillow (large and "induced"), most "plus" will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow should support the head and with the tip only intervene to the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
As a suitable size, 50 x 60 cm is recommended, which is preferred, for example, in Scandinavia.
When lying on the side, the pillow should equalize the height of the shoulder (along with the shoulder blade or the soft zone in the mattress).
Modern mattresses have nothing in common with the original straws filled with grasses.
In fact, their manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least admixtures.
The trend was also in the mattress.
Raw materials from the oil from which polyurethane foams are produced are replaced by natural oils such as salt and soybean.
It is the soybeans that are used by all known manufacturers.
"Bio in mattresses means that the core is made from a material of pure natural origin," explains Petr Vasí<0xC4><0x8D>ek of Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the production of mattresses, one of the first being aloe vera.
But you can also afford microcapsules to relax the fresh smell of wood or lavender.
There is also a division for men and women.
While men "cooling" the herbal extract from the cold so that the mattress cover absorbs heat and cools the body, women on the contrary "smelt" the covers.
Red pepper extract increases blood circulation, making it warmer for the weaker sex.
Today's favorites?
The mattress is made of cold foam (it has larger pores with broken cellular structure, so it is more breathable than regular polyurethane and also offers better elasticity.
Combining different hardnesses of cold foam and "line" foam, multi-zone mattresses are formed, which know exactly where the head, thighs and thighs should be.
You will pay for a high-quality mattress from 7,000 crowns and above.
Those who meet health parameters, have a lower VAT rate, are portrayed as health aid.
The first in the Czech Republic to achieve this advantage was Gumotex.
Saving on the mattress and grill is not easy.
Sometimes, for example, it is possible to take advantage of the actions of manufacturers or sellers who offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, Magniflex offers a Duofreeze mattress with embroidered memory foam Memory in a bowl for CZK 11,990.
The second one, however, can already be purchased for free.
The age of linseed or viscoelastic foam with an open cell structure and high density was initiated by the "cosmic" rate of the material Tempur.
It was originally created as a material for NASA, as astronauts were exposed to a huge overload at the start.
The temperature softens in the heat, in the cold, on the contrary, it strengthens.
It adapts perfectly to the warm human body and distributes its pressure optimally.
Therefore, it is ideal against the formation of stretch marks, but also for increased sleep comfort.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses, but also for medical products, for example for special pillows under the legs, which relieve the legs and the vein system.
Domestic manufacturers use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and the like.
People-tracking devices want more and more parents, so they want to care for their children
Fear of one’s own child is bringing more and more people to the idea of GPS surveillance.
The system originally created for the search for cars can also monitor the movement of people, and thereby help in cases such as the disappearance of nine-year-old Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka Janatková.
The device is still about as big as a box of silk, but soon it can only be as big as a watch.
Many people were frightened by the case of the missing Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka and began to ask for the means to better protect their children.
And at the cost of violating their privacy.
“We’re trying to tell everyone that it’s not about any espionage, but about another means to reduce the likelihood that some tragedy will happen,” said Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of monitoring devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that in some cases, such devices may be misused, for example, when they are put in a bag to someone who doesn't know about it, but we've never encountered such a case before."
“Most of the time, customers actually buy it for security reasons,” Pilin added.
According to him, the child should always know what the "cattle" is for and how it is used in case of an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bo<0xC4><0x8D>ková warns that if the child does not want to wear anything like this, he will simply get rid of it.
“Even very young children show great creativity in how to deliberately lose some things when they don’t want to be under control.”
"High expectations have been raised in the past for parents of mobile phones, but they can turn off as well as these tracking devices," Bo<0xC4><0x8D>ková says.
It is also controversial whether such a device would actually help in the event of an attack.
“When it comes to a ready-made kidnapping, the perpetrator will almost always make sure that the child does not have any electronics that could reveal his or her location.”
"Now it's a phone."
“When they start expanding their tracking devices, they’ll look for them, because their sales will certainly be supported by massive advertising.”
“In such a case, criminals will always be one step ahead of the police,” the psychologist says.
However, he admits that a similar device can help in the event of an imminent pedophile attack.
According to Robert <0xC4><0x8C>ech of RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and people, even in the event that an attack occurs to the immediate destruction of the tracking device, his presence can help.
"The device can be set to periodically forward the position after a certain period of time."
"If it is damaged, at least the last position of the person concerned will be available."
"Precious devices also have built-in acclonometers, so even if a person just slipped and remained immobile, the device will immediately send a warning with a position," says <0xC4><0x8C>ech.
According to him, a similar service can also be taken by smartphones with navigation, where it is enough to record special software.
The problem with current tracking units is that they are either devices similar to box-sized trailers from sirens or smaller mobile phones.
They're always so in danger of losing them.
According to Pilina from Macro Weil, therefore, devices that look like normal digital clocks are now being tested.
"This will have the biggest advantage in that any aggressor may not be aware of the tracking device at all."
"Or she will recognize them after a while and it can give the police extra time," she adds.
Whether the tracking devices develop into bracelets or trailers, they will still use the same technology that is used for car monitoring.
This is a combination of position detection via the GPS system (using conventional autonavigation) and a mobile phone function that reports the current position of the vehicle.
The army has inflammatory ropes to encircle the Czech Republic, but it only lasts two years.
The Czech Army has purchased 445 kilometres of ropes to light the cracks.
Last year, the Ministry of Defence added 224 kilometres of ropes to the warehouses.
The army has 225 years of supplies.
The problem is that the durability of the ropes is two, up to four years.
The army bought inflammatory ropes from the stock STV Group, a.s. for 40 million kroner.
The general staff in the justification for the purchase of such a large number of MF DNES inflammatory ropes denied that soldiers consume 60 kilometres of lighters per year during training.
However, from the calculations of military pyrotechnicians addressed by MF DNES, it appears that then a very intensive pyrotechnic training would have to be conducted annually by all generals, officers of the army’s command, secretaries or cleaners.
Defence Minister Alexandr Vondru and army commander Vlastimil Pick are not excluded.
This is the only way to justify the annual consumption of an army of 60 kilometres of fireworks.
This length corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if it were, the stockpiles of the army would have been sufficient for more than a decade.
If, on the other hand, two meters of inflammatory rope were sufficient for the basic training of each new professional, as experts say, the army has secured – even with increased consumption of marital or special units – supplies for 22 years.
The soldiers of the rapid deployment brigade recently personally complained to Minister Vondro that they had virtually no handguns, so shootings due to the need for money are limited.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"It doesn't take my head to buy so many fireworks from us over and over again."
But that is their decision, and they certainly know what they will be after.
“For us, the army is a good customer, to whom we as traders try to satisfy,” says Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD>, STV Group’s business manager.
Defence Ministry spokesman Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek justifies hundreds of kilometres of purchased ropes even by the fact that the army will have stockpiles of this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD> of the STV Group talks only about the four-year life of a firefighter and a police or military pyrotechnician even about two years.
"With perfect storage, it can be the four," says one of them, who, as a soldier, does not want to publish the name because of the criticism of the army.
After the end of life, each ammunition must be carefully tested to see if it is still reliable and does not endanger the lives of soldiers.
However, these tests are not free and cost additional money.
Another argument of the ministry is the quantitative discount on 445 kilometres of inflammatory ropes.
“We were 60 percent less than last year’s supply of two hundred and forty kilometres,” Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek said in a statement.
For comparison only: the annual consumption of firing cords of police pyrotechnics, which eliminate ammunition from World War II or here after the Soviet army, has not exceeded 1,500 meters for several years.
And the police are always ordering only enough to consume this ammunition before the end of life.
This has been proven for the safety of pyrotechnicians, and it can also be more flexible to obtain more modern, and therefore more reliable types of wires.
The Ministry of Defence is already in serious trouble with the disposal of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Treaty, when the Czechoslovak army of two thousand was preparing to drag on the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians addressed by MF DNES, the same problem awaits the Czech Republic in a few years: it will eliminate hundreds of kilometres of old fireworks that "lacino" is buying today.
I still draw from the contacts I have gained through the competition.
The winning spot in the Lifetime of the Year competition helped Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun to sell his hotel franchise.
The winner of last year’s competition <0xC5><0xBD>ivnostník of the Year was the 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukas Pytloun from Liberia.
His success story is like a movie.
Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun liked to travel.
And abroad, he realized that in Liberia there is a lack of quality accommodation at a reasonable price.
From savings from foreign brigades and using a bank loan, he bought a semi-detached house with five apartments.
The fact that he was still a student of the third year of high school at the time was a great deal of courage.
"The current relationship between quality and price of accommodation with us did not give me any chance not to try to do anything about it," says Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun.
The first renovated apartment began to rent out to foreign workers.
All the profits were invested back in the house, which gradually transformed into a 54-bed pension.
Since then, in seven years, he has managed to open four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds in all accommodation categories in Liberec.
The most comfortable of them until recently was the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year, there was another, equally high quality.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel on the island of Tissau, where we have sold our franchise concept, and other interested in the Pytloun hotel franchise is reporting," says last year's number one businessman.
"And this sale of the license to operate the hotel was largely part of the victory in the Lifetime of the Year competition," Pytloun added.
The victory brought him greater fame and popularity in Liberec and its surroundings.
“People knew me on the streets, they often congratulated me more and I have to say it was nice,” she recalls.
Participation in the competition definitely recommends to anyone who is trying something.
There is no need to win, every visibility is good.
He says that he still draws from contacts and acquaintances that he might not otherwise have reached.
“With some of the people I met through the competition, I started trading regularly.”
The fame associated with success, according to him, has also affected every employee a little.
He has about 70 of them.
“I see greater loyalty and pride in them to be involved in something that has gained universal recognition.”
“It’s not by far just my personal success, it’s the result of the good work we all do together.”
"Only my name is drawn to the fore," says Lukas Pytloun.
I wish my successors a quieter year than we had at the Farm
The euphoria of victory quickly replaced the effects of the crisis.
However, thanks to the goal-consciousness of the winner, Farmet has worse times behind him.
For the prize for the first place in the last year of the Vodafone Firm competition of the year, the owner of Farmet, Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>, came to the Slovenian house last year.
The jury then appreciated the effort through which he built a small tooling workshop in <0xC4><0x8C>eská Skalica company with stamilion turnovers.
"I can say that the award has encouraged not only me, but all of my colleagues and increased our confidence in the competition with the competition," the winner said.
At the beginning of Farmet’s history, there was a desire to do something useful.
And so, when the state offered his father Karl <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>arsky to rent a small workshop as compensation for the Communists seized property, he did not hesitate for a long time, he refused a career in the company where he worked at the time, and with a few friends around his father set up a company for plastic bathtubs.
Soon afterwards, they began to specialize in vegetable oil pulp.
After eighteen years, they became the largest manufacturer of automatic mills in Central Europe.
Increased awareness among the non-professional public was gained by the company after its success in the competition through the media.
“Not only did our customers begin to perceive the Farmet brand significantly better, but foreign partners also began to appreciate working with a company that has achieved greater success in their country,” says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
Last year, however, Farmet was not just a sign of euphoria from the victory.
The assessment was based on the company’s economic results until 2008 and only partially from 2009.
2009 was the hardest year for the sale of mechanical goods.
It peaked in a crisis that hasn’t touched so much citizens yet, but companies have already stopped their investment projects and started restricting the purchase of new machines and technologies.
"Of course, this situation has not been avoided by us."
“Revenues fell by 40 percent, we had to limit production and there was also a dismissal,” explains Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
A viable company must be able to make such unpopular measures sometimes.
But they managed the situation and kept the company profitable, even smaller than before the crisis.
What they didn’t do at the Farm, however, is investing in research and development.
"With the grant we built a research and training center, we strengthened the presentation at international fairs, won the main awards in domestic exhibitions," says <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
It all proves that the crisis is behind them.
Revenues are growing again and with them the number of new employees.
“I wish the new winner a pleasant feeling of victory, but in a quieter atmosphere,” says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
A survey that removes nonsensical regulations
The Absurdity Survey of the Year is the fourth part of an entrepreneurial profession.
Some nonsense regulations have already been repealed.
The unfamous winner of the next year of the Absurdita survey of the year was the obligation to carry documents to the office, which are also available online to officials.
More than a third of the less than 4,000 voters voted.
For example, the Social Security Administration required a paper extract from a business registry, although an official can get it by two clicks of a mouse.
Thanks to the survey, this will change.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require an excerpt from the trade register during the checks at the insurance payers," said <0xC4><0x8C>SSZ spokeswoman Jana Bura<0xC5><0x88>ová.
To lighten up on all the regulations and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic must comply, and those nonsensical to cancel them are the meaning of the Absurdity competition of the year.
This is already the fourth part of the business event organized by Economic Newspapers this year, and the popularity is growing among the public.
If there were about 3,000 voters in the polls last year, there were at least 4,000 voters this year.
And it is not surprising that the various legal obligations, which serve only to restrain business, are still sufficient and sufficient.
"Perhaps in the number of listings for tax admission we are in the leading places in the world," notes Karel Havlí<0xC4><0x8D>ek of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
In recent years, business simplification has become a proclaimed goal of all governments.
Compared to the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic does not improve particularly.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranked 74th in terms of business conditions, which is eight places worse than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year Competition was first announced in 2006 and takes place annually according to the same scenario.
Anybody can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense annually from April to the end of September, when the competition is closed.
The website www.firmaku.cz is used to register. Then the organiser of the competition will select seven candidates for the "anticipation" and will allow the public to vote on it during October via the Internet on the websites www.firmaku.cz/absurdita and www.hinned.cz.
The absurdity that gets the most votes wins.
This year’s survey reported more than a hundred, more than 105 regulations and regulations that are meaningless.
The tips were sent by entrepreneurs, as well as trade unions and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, for example, among the nominees was the requirement that cars for the maintenance of highways and highways pay tariffs, or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets paint every two years.
The list of this year’s seven proposals is published on the page of the competition.
The announcement of the competition, which always takes place at the beginning of November on Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of a hapenning, which regularly involves the personalities of political and social life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, Director of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Businessmen of the Czech Republic, or Petr Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el, President of the Czech Chamber of Commerce.
“Economic prosperity can’t work where the state throws entrepreneurs at their feet, so my goal is to abolish at least three dozen paragraphs every year that make business unnecessarily complicated today,” said Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
The attempt to break a nonsense regulation does not seem empty.
In 2007, people were most affected by the obligation of the entrepreneur to report three days in advance to the commercial wall office in the place where the permanent operating facility is located, the intention to go with a stand for the exhibition or a walk.
This obligation was abolished by the new Trade Act.
The second most-voted obligation in 2007, which was to report to the Labour Office for its foreign worker travel for up to 30 days, was removed by the so-called Green Card Act.
And to the third of all good.
In 2009, it became absurd for physiotherapists to have a large mirror, a refrigerator and two hand weights in the office.
This was mitigated this year by the statement of the Ministry of Health - the obligation to have a refrigerator has fallen.
The new category appreciates socially responsible companies
Environmental, humanitarian, educational or sporting projects are evaluated.
The new category in this year’s fifth year of the competition of Economic Newspapers is called Responsible Company of 2010.
The mission of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair business.
“This is how we want to support companies that take into account the environmental impact of their business and promote socially responsible activities,” says Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of the mobile operator, Vodafone, which is the announcer and guarantor of the competition as well as in the case of the year.
By this year’s first year of this special subcategory of the Vodafone Firm’s main competition of 2010, companies for which success in the business is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is very inspiring and would publish a separate article.
Although the subject matter of their activities differs diametrically from each other, their efforts can be regarded as joint denominators of support and consideration.
In one case, for example, it concerns the affected people and elsewhere, for example, personal problems or the health of their own employees.
For example, the Prague software firm Et Netera, which supports the creation of informal sports teams among employees who then take part in a number of tournaments in various sports, was among the fourteen finalists throughout the Republic.
Another example of the responsible company from the Pardubice region is Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor to the fund sponsoring disabled children for seventeen years.
About its disabled employees, a paper from Pod<0xC4><0x9B>brad, which has more than 70 percent of them, hence won the title of Responsible Company of the Central Czech Region and in the Vodafone Competition the company ranked third in the region.
In Olomouc, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft won, which introduced flexible working hours, further reduced to an average of 35 hours per week, but without a relatively reduced salary.
The title was also awarded by the jury because it prefers to shop with Czech manufacturers, supports public activities in the vicinity and saves the environment.
“We try to recycle as much as possible so that our business and our administration have as little environmental impact as possible,” explains director Milushe Ryznarová.
Responsible IT company Enlogit from <0xC3><0x9A>steck<0xC3><0xBD> region again thinks about the health of its employees and has provided them with ergonomic chairs and keyboards for each notebook, supports their work from home and at its corporate events uses catering services provided by local law enforcement.
"In addition, we support the foundation <0xC5><0xBD>lov<0xC4><0x9B>k in distress, which helps specifically the local Roma community," said Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Such<0xC3><0xBD>, a representative of the company.
Last but not least, it is also worth mentioning the activity of the Laundry and Cleaning Company from the Karlovy Vary region, which contributes to their pension insurance to its employees in the form of superstandard bonuses.
“We are also contributing to food, transport, training and recreation,” says Josef Strapá<0xC4><0x8D> of the Bruntian construction company Czasch, winner in the Moravian region.
In the category Responsible Company of the Year, all regional finalists of the Vodafone Company of the Year were automatically registered, who answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organisers by 15 August at the latest.
Incorrectly completed or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were then excluded from the evaluation by the organiser.
"If the competitor's representatives did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the Competition Responsible Company of the Year, but they are not disqualified from the "main" Vodafone Competition of the Year."
“It is not possible to sign up for this competition alone, as this is the subcategory of the Company’s main competition of the year,” explains Karel Goldman of the management agency Bison & Rose.
Police arrested at Pilsen Land Fund at a public contest
The anti-corruption police have been arrested in the building of the Land Fund in Pilsen in the past few days.
<0xC5><0xBD>elízka detectives deployed to the local media businessman and real estate merchant Lubo<0xC5><0xA1>i G.
It allegedly attempted to manipulate the current public competition for the treatment of reimbursement claims in such a way that the land offered in the competition was acquired by a specific interested party.
He was supposed to pay Lubo<0xC5><0xA1>i G. half a million kroner for it.
"In the meantime, I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting one person for breaking the lawsuits in public procurement and in public competitions," Plze<0xC5><0x88> State Attorney General Antonie Zelená said, stating that further details regarding the ongoing investigation were not provided.
The 46-year-old businessman was released after 24 hours.
The way in which competition could have influenced public competition can only be speculated in the light of the minimum amount of official information.
Lubomír <0xC4><0x8C>erná, a spokeswoman for the Lubomír <0xC4><0x8C>erná Land Fund, said that police officers were actually arrested at a separate workplace in Pilsen during a public competition.
"It was a client, not our employee," she said.
According to Black, the correct title of the competition is "Call for the tender for the transfer of land under land law" and takes place when the land offered is of interest to more eligible applicants.
"These persons, within the framework of the call, offer a higher value of their reimbursement claims to be settled by transfer than the declared value of the property."
"Based on the claims offered, the order of the buyers is determined and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who offered the highest claims," a spokeswoman for the fund explained.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. apparently had the information of who signed up for the challenge, and since he himself is also the eligible person, because he bought a number of reimbursement claims, he offered to the applicants the land not to participate in the contest.
Apparently, he's incurring deferrals for that.
That would explain that he had such a large sum of money in his detention.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. had superior contacts at PF in Pilsen in the past.
He figured in the case of former PF chief Václav Sankot, who was criminally prosecuted for issuing in the replacement restitution of the land on which the decision to place the building had already been issued.
At that time, Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. obtained from the fund, for example, land intended for the construction of public transport, specifically in the place where the entry road to the industrial zone Borská Pole was to be built.
Later, it was very convenient to exchange them with the highway for a house in the very historic center of the city, which had a much higher value.
At that time, the city council had to take action because otherwise, blocking the land would endanger the building.
Households pay hundreds of dollars per month for housing
From January, households will have to pay for not only all kinds of energy, but also for water and yachts, heat supplies and rents will grow somewhere.
Families will have to withdraw hundreds of crowns a month from their wallets from January.
Electricity will grow by up to 4.6 percent, gas will be about 2 percent more expensive, up to a tenth in some cities you will have to pay for water supplies and will often also undermine central heat supplies.
Electricity irradiation should cost households in apartments a year more than now.
Electricity prices have been reduced by all major suppliers, which is why there is a significant increase in support for the production of energy from renewable sources, especially photovoltaics.
While gas is rising slightly, it is at a time when people melt the most and thus have the highest consumption.
It must also count on hundreds of additional crowns per year.
While electricity and gas flow throughout the republic, the change in central heating prices varies from place to place.
Price increases are planned mainly by larger municipalities.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradci Králové will pay from January for central heating about 50 kroner per month in addition, more than 1,000 kroner per year will be paid to families in Liberec.
The citizens of Prague, in turn, are threatened by more than 9% of water and yachting stations, even if the city increases the lease from the infrastructure.
If the rent does not change, Pra<0xC5><0xBE>ene will pay 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague will still belong in the entire republic compared to the lower.
In the north of the Czech Republic, where prices are already among the highest, water and nautical irrigation is expected by 7.4 percent.
For example, they can significantly increase the rent price in 450,000 rental apartments, where regulation ends in January.
For example, CPI Apartments, which owns about 2,500 apartments in <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem, plans to increase rents by up to one hundred percent from January.
Those who will not agree to the new lease will bring the company to court.
Regulated rents, which people pay in about 300,000 apartments, could grow by up to 10% next year.
Czech children are drunk with ferneth and rum. Beer is out of fashion, it works slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka, exceptionally better brand of whiskey stolen from parents.
These are the drinks after which drinks most often end up in the care of doctors drunken people who are not even fifteen years old.
There are no exceptions for children who are repeatedly treated with a monkey in the hospital.
This is due to the experience of doctors who encounter similar cases in the revenues of children’s hospital departments.
“Some beer or wines are completely out of fashion, because it takes a long time to drink them.”
"Trend is definitely hard alcohol," said Pravu Primary School of Hospital Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice in central Czech Republic Lud<0xC4><0x9B>k Pelikan.
"If they manage to pull the bottle out of the cupboard, it's about whiskey, but otherwise it's a Fernet and vodka."
"Vodaka has the advantage of being poured into the juice, and there is not so much of it to feel," explained the primary teacher.
And for the truth, the spokesman of the Faculty Hospital Motol Eva Jurin also gives him.
"Most often it's a Fernet or a Rum."
"This is modern alcohol today, especially in primary schools."
"In some cases, it was a sliver that they brought from home," Jurin said.
According to the mayor of Pelikan, 13 or 14-year-old drinkers at hospital reception are relatively common.
Before Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years in pediatrics in Motola, where ambulances are tied up by underprivileged schoolchildren from a wide area.
"There was a girl lying there about four times."
"She started her career at the age of twelve when she was brought to us with 3.5-million-plus alcohol in the blood in combination with ecstasy," the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at an exhibition in Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice at some dance party."
“It’s interesting that her mother didn’t seem strange at all, that she didn’t know about her daughter for 48 hours,” the prime minister said.
It is the lack of interest of parents or even their considerable tolerance for drinking their own offspring that is considered to be the main cause of the growing child's drunkenness.
However, according to experts in children, it is not possible to talk about addiction in the true sense of the word.
“Alcoholics refers to a multi-year chronic dependence on alcohol with all the phenomena associated with it, and that is not the case in children.”
“In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, there is rather a symptomatic unintended family-social background,” said Pelikan.
According to a spokesman for Jurin, around 40 drunk children were hospitalized at the pediatric clinic in Motol by mid-November.
However, only those with severe intoxication who had to stay in the hospital are included in the statistics.
Kids who take their parents away after an outpatient treatment, or if they are transported home by the police, do not count at all.
Apart from the cases where children just sit after school and drink a bottle of spices, according to Pelikan, there are three seasonal variations that can be relied on: witches, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"Either they drink grief from a bad confession, or they celebrate the beginning of the holidays."
"Of course, as a witch, I experienced seven child drunks at the same time," Pelikan said.
The drunk, who spends the night detoxing under the supervision of doctors, is paradoxically advantageous compared to the one who suffers from an unpleasant coconut on the second day at home.
The early headaches caused by dehydration and glucose deficiency will trigger infusions of glucose and nutrients that are missing in the body.
"They're actually better at it, because after that beautiful evening experience they have a good awakening and nothing hurts."
"They're just confused about where they are," Pelikan admitted, affirming that sometimes he'll spoil patients' pleasant moods at least by listing the costs that their treatment required.
The transport of ambulances and hospitalization on an acute bed will also cost tens of thousands of crowns.
“I used it as a means of education when I was calculating the amount of drunkenness they had on the visit and that they could also spend all summer in the brigade to earn money for that one party,” Pelikan added.
However, according to him, health insurance companies do not have access to regression procedures, in which the costs of treatment would be borne by the parents, in the case of child drunks.
Two L-159 aircraft are in foreign hands for the first time in Spain
Two L-159 aircraft out of a total of five, for which the Czech Ministry of Defence exchanged the transport aircraft Casa C-295M, flew to Spain on Tuesday, where the aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is based.
This is the first time machines of this type have appeared in the possession of someone other than the Czech army.
So far, they have only been in practice or performance years.
This is a two-seat L-159T1 version, which was operated by the Czech Army and was capable of flying.
The remaining three machines are single-seat L-159.
They have been reserved in Aeru Vodokhody and the trade broker - Omnipol - bought them last week.
When the aircraft physically departs from Vodochod, Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ka of the Defence Department says it is not yet known.
"The L-159 single-seat aircraft for the change were removed from the long-haul aircraft, without any further deposits and investments from the Ministry's resort."
"The two-seat L-159T1 was changed in its current state and shape," said Právu Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
He added that the army will not remain without two-seat aircraft, as the ministry signed a contract with Aerem Vodochody in May 2009 for the conversion of four unnecessary L-159 machines to two-seat machines.
One new aircraft was taken over by the army in July, the other will take over by the end of this year.
According to Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ka, EADS has pledged to deploy aircraft into the weapons of some Allied countries.
"The contract clearly states that the buyer of the L-159 aircraft is EADS and will be used to train pilots from NATO countries."
"It is therefore the customer's business, how he will implement this," Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
Economic newspapers said earlier that, for example, the Spanish army was not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for one Casa aircraft and the purchase of three more aircraft for 3.5 billion SEK was approved last year by the government of Mirka Topolánka.
The Ministry of Defence did not order a procurement procedure and contacted the EADS directly.
The defence leadership at that time argued that the exchange would support future exports of L-159 abroad.
The Czech Army has bought 72 aircraft from Aer and uses only 24, the rest would like to sell.
The purchase of the Casa aircraft is likely to have a court order as well.
The European Commission has appealed the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice for choosing aircraft based on a pan-European tender and not by a single manufacturer’s address.
The army has already taken over three Casa aircraft, the latter is expected to arrive at Kbely Airport in Prague within fourteen days.
Longer indicator than ring indicates lower risk of cancer
Men who have a marker longer than the ring are at a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday by the British Cancer Journal.
This can be related to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
“Our results show that the relative finger length can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, especially for men under the age of 60,” said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could thus help determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, especially in combination with genetic risk or other risk factors such as family health burden, Eeles added.
Between 1994 and 2009, she and her colleagues in the UK followed more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time more than 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had a pointer on their right hand shorter than a ring.
They had the same likelihood of prostate cancer as 19 percent of those whose fingers were just as long.
For those who had an index longer than the ring, however, this risk decreased by 33 percent, and for men up to the age of sixties, a decrease of even 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned - formed in the prenatal period - apparently reflects the different levels of sex hormones to which the baby is exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer indicator.
Previous research has shown that it is testosterone that promotes growing prostate cancer.
A leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, Václav Pa<0xC4><0x8D>es for <0xC4><0x8C>TK, said he knew about the study at the same time, but it does not appear to him that the relationship between finger length and cancer was "completely proven".
The Czech Republic is under the snow, D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered by snow on Thursday morning.
On the roads and pedestrians lies mostly riding snow, motorists in many places have been riding all night.
The D5 between the 89th and 93th kilometer in the direction of Rozvadov is closed in the morning due to several accidents of trucks and passenger cars and also stands D1 near Brno in the direction of Prague.
This was reported by the Central Automotive Club (<0xC3><0x9A>AMK) dispatcher.
Two trucks crashed on the 91th kilometre, two trucks crashed on the 93th kilometre, and an accident caused injuries.
Several passenger cars also ended up in the trench.
The problems are also on the D1 motorway at 185 km in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks collided there.
Drivers should take the 190th kilometre in front of Brno or go over Brno and then take the 182nd kilometre on Kyvalce.
A few kilometres of columns are formed there.
There is also an accident on the D11 motorway, immediately upon arrival in Prague.
In Prague lies a layer of several centimeters of snow, temperatures show a minus seven degrees Celsius.
Car columns are created, for example, on the Proseku, also covered with <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>rboholská.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
The trams run late, for example, on the track between Charles Square and Peace Square.
At eight o’clock in the morning, the Prague Crisis Staff will be reunited.
The railways and airports are also facing problems.
The Czech trails had to cancel seven high-speed connections due to snow.
For example, there are problems with the route from Prague to Kralup or from Prague to Beroun.
Passengers should check the current situation.
Ruzyne Airport was closed from Wednesday 11 a.m. to 5 a.m.
Most roads in southern Moravia are already congested, but only with increased caution.
In Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kovsk there are three adjacent roads, in Brno, the places are snow-language and in Blanensk, some communications are necessary in the above-mentioned areas of the snow chain.
Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kovsko was one of the most affected places.
So far there are closed roads: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kucherov and also <0xC5><0xA0>aratice - Mile<0xC5><0xA1>ovice.
To stretch them, you will need to put the mills.
When they will be evacuated, it is not yet estimated.
At Hodonínsk, caution is needed in the White Carpathian region.
On the roads, which are kept there for the sake of nature conservation only by inert debris, there is a snow layer of up to five centimeters, <0xC4><0x8C>TK said.
In the Czech Republic, snow was thought to be between two and ten centimeters, the most rain fell in the northern Czech Republic, often up to 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian region, about 15 centimeters of snow were thought to be snow.
Snowfall in the Czech Republic is gradually rising.
U.S. troops have a new ‘smart weapon’
The U.S. military has deployed a new "chip" weapon in Afghanistan, known only under the codename XM-25 so far.
The generals hope that the new automatic rifle will affect the conflict there with the Taliban and “change the game” in their favor.
A new weapon is like a small super-precision gun.
Its projectiles feature a laser with an accuracy of several meters.
Special cartridges of 25 mm, developed for this rifle and containing high explosive corrosion, actually act as small grenades.
The loads can be programmed so that they explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
It can therefore be used against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle, behind a wall or in a graveyard.
For the mountain is usually not protected, and if a deadly rain of steel beams is carried on it, it can get it out of the fight.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new gun is the first infantry weapon that uses "smart" technology.
"The soldier deals with it in principle by finding a target, sending a laser beam to it, which determines the distance, thus obtains a precise point of purpose, according to it, adjusts the purpose, and knocks the trigger."
"Let's say you measured 543 meters."
"When you press the trigger, the gun is loaded and fired at a distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters," Audette said.
400 jobs will be relocated
The Fujitsu Group moves its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
400 employees will move their jobs in July next year from the previous administrative building on Marienbader Square in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu moves its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the giant in the industry specializing in computers and their maintenance announced on Wednesday, it will move 400 men and women's jobs in July next year from the previous administrative building at Marienbader-Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, which is a large administrative complex in Frankfurt, Lübeck.
According to a spokesman for Fujitsu, another 100 jobs of the group, which are currently distributed in the region, should be relocated there in the near future.
The lease offer was said to be very attractive and the large offices in Astro Park are said to be more suited to the way employees work.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was only for rent.
Competent CEO Bernd Wagner said, "in Frankfurt-Niederrad we have found a headquarters with excellent infrastructure."
Excellent connection to the airport is very important for a global company like Fujitsu.
Yesterday, the recent move of an important company within the region brought joy to the winners and disappointment to the losers.
Frankfurt's chief economic referee Markus Frank (CDU) said it had managed to win a "global player".
It is said to be a “fantastic expression of trust in this place.”
Fujitsu is said to fit the city, the settlement is an important momentum for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (Green), regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city was reportedly informed in a timely manner by the company’s management of its intentions.
"Of course, we offered the company our help," Korwisi said.
Friendly contacts, however, could not change the problems of the computer manufacturer with the landlord on Marienbader Square.
As a result, there were decisive economic reasons.
Now it is about avoiding long-term non-occupation in such a prominent place.
"I hope he will be the owner and tenant of the cooperative building."
The house on the Rathaus Square, which Fujitsu used so far, and the neighboring "Small Vertical" were among the most discussed building plans of the spa city ten years ago, along with other buildings on Marienbader Square.
Between the railway station and the town hall was created as a joint project of the city and a private designer called the city entrance, which was criticized for the massive construction of the areas that previously served as a parking lot and at the same time because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment advisory and rating company Feri, a manufacturer of travel distribution software, Start Amadeus, as well as the manufacturer of Fujitsu computers, which was still connected to Siemens at the time.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired in 2006 by Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and sold to Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid after a year.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu Group is ranked as the third largest IT provider in the world.
It offers computer companies and servers, for example, and also takes care of the necessary service.
The branch in the Rhine and Mohan region is one of the largest in Germany, but the majority of Fujitsu employees are in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, Fujitsu Technology Solutions is moving to Frankfurt-Niederrad, another subsidiary in the area will be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
In the administrative building Astro Park was rented 7000 square meters for this purpose.
In the complex - its name points to the star soilys, which is twenty years old, is also home to the central union of the electrical and electronic industry among others.
Amazon shuts down server – threats against Assange
WikiLeaks is getting into the tight.
Amazon has turned off the platform on its servers for detection.
It is possible that this has happened to political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic reports.
Wikileaks founder Assange is reportedly staying in the UK.
Wikileaks, a platform for discovery, is under increasing pressure in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their home server in America so far and are now looking for an internet home in Europe.
In the meantime, prominent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and businesses to boycott WikiLeaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is headed on the Interpol search list, is due to abstain, according to one newspaper post in the UK.
"Wikileaks is no longer on Amazon's server."
"Free speech in the country of the free," activists said on Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Recently, the Internet company Amazon downloaded Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists used Amazon Web Service (AWS) to handle a high number of accesses to documents when publishing secret diplomatic surveys.
WikiLeaks said on Twitter: “Okay, we’re going to spend our dollars now by hiring people in Europe.”
When Amazon has such problems with freedom of expression, “then they should stop selling books.”
Amazon suspended its use of its servers for WikiLeaks after collaborators of Senator Joe Lieberman reportedly conducted a search, CNN broadcasting on the basis of information from Lieberman's office.
The chairman of the Senate House Defence Committee threatened Amazon with a boycott, the British "Guardian" reported.
“I would like Amazon to take this step earlier, given the earlier disclosures of classified information on WikiLeaks,” the senator said.
In the meantime, Lieberman has called for the platform to be prevented from using servers in other countries as well.
"Wikileaks acts illegally, recklessly and recklessly, putting our national security at risk and threatening the lives of the entire planet," the Senator said in a statement.
"No responsible company - either American or foreign - should help Wikileaks in their efforts to expand the stolen material."
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is being sought by Swedish authorities on suspicion of rape, is on the Interpol search list.
According to a report in the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian is being detained in the UK, Scotland Yard is said to know the exact location.
An internet activist has always labeled investigations in Sweden as the intrigues of his opponents.
Wikileaks spokeswoman Kristinn Hrafnsson in London said there were threats.
"There were even calls for the murder of Julian Assange."
That's why Assange is rightly concerned about his safety, Hrafnsson said.
The founder of WikiLeaks will continue to hide.
Hrafnsson must have reacted to speeches from North America.
In the United States, former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, has demanded that the person responsible for posting to WikiLeaks be charged with treason and executed.
In Canada, government adviser Stephen Harper said on television - apparently ironically, Assange should be "assassinated" and Obama could use a "target plane".
In the meantime, the White House and Assange's vocabulary shot was disbanded.
U.S. President Barack Obama’s spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it “ ridiculous and absurd” that Assange demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for recent spying calls to diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we're interested in the opinion of one person with a website," Gibbs said.
“Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much more important than its website.”
The U.S. government is now extensively investigating the security of its databases.
The Special Representative was appointed by the Deputy Director of the Center for Counter-Terrorism Measures, Russell Travers, the White House said.
Travers became responsible for the development of "necessary structural reforms" that are necessary after the publication of reports from the embassy on WikiLeaks.
The White House also wants to review ways the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. government has also announced it wants to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists if they are in danger of being released on WikiLeaks.
“We did everything we could to get in touch with them,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Philip Crowley said.
"We are ready to protect them if it is necessary."
The University of Ice Cream
At "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice cream candies are prepared for a better season.
The basic course for future ice creammakers, which lasts for three days, is of great interest and visitors come from all over the world.
Where does the ice cream come from?
From Gelateria and from Gelatia.
Gelatiere, a slightly outdated Czech ice cream maker, according to all the rules of Italian ice cream art.
Gelataio pulls the ice cream out of the cooling box with a scrap of ice cream, puts it into a fee and sells it.
To find out, you do not have to drive to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But if you want to learn more about ice cream, you will not avoid the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
In 2003, the manufacturer of ice cream machines established an ice cream university to make the ice cream from its machines meet the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The basic course for the future Gelatieri, which lasts for three days, is of great interest and visitors come from all over the world.
There are also several days of special courses on chocolate ice cream and practice in your own ice cream shop.
Some people want a new career in their Midlife-Crisis, others dare on the thin ice of their vague claims.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries from all over the world – from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the Slow-Food movement and would like to offer a high-quality European product in the country of industrial Ice-Cream.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and would like to start her own after years of stressful work.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
One Maltese man and one Brazilian want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and a Canadian woman in Julia's household came because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari will first explain to participants the ideal properties of perfect ice cream.
Decisive is not only good taste, but also silk softness and good consistency.
Luciano will not forget during his training on the Southern and patriotic cherry on the cake: "Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then that includes a noteworthy dose of romance."
The first step of production seems to be quite simple.
Luciano puts the basic ingredients of milk, starch, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer, which heats everything electronically to 85 degrees and then immediately cools to four degrees.
Then turn on the machine with a hook and pasteurized white basic cream leaks, the basis of all kinds of milk ice cream.
The teacher is immediately overwhelmed with questions: Is it possible to make ice cream only from natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can one experiment on its own?
Luciano warns to be abducted by the spirit of time into the unknown.
Who talks about ice cream "only from natural ingredients", probably used the same stabilizers - mostly a natural product, such as guar flour from guar seeds.
Of course, it is possible to make ice cream even without stabilizers, but it must be sold in one day, otherwise it will collapse and the customer will have ice cream itself.
Certain variations of the basic matter are allowed.
It will be more exciting with aromatic essences.
Maestro Luciano distinguishes the taste of ice cream by the ingredients that are purchased in the supermarket either in the fruit department or in the candy department.
In addition, there are pills and creams.
"Suppliers will try to impose a lot of aromatized ingredients on you."
"You just have to experiment."
Either with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or with ice cream from white basics, which turns eggs into yellow cream and cacao on the basis of all sorts of chocolate temptations.
Now they can take a course on ice cream machines.
Luciano always lets them make four different types of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and walnut ice cream - either with or without eggs in the base material, with more or less vanilla flavor or other natural ingredients.
The same experiment will be carried out with fruit types of ice cream.
More aromatic substances, more fruit purée - due to the taste it is not always better.
Whey ice cream may not taste more nutty if it contains more whey nuts.
The most popular kiwi ice cream is made by a group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only when the balanced mixture raises the Gelato taste correctly, says Luciano.
The production of ice cream is a purely numerical task: If peanut butter is used with a lot of sugar, the proportion of sugar in the basic recipe must be reduced.
For lemon ice cream, you need an extra portion of sugar.
Luciano removes an apparatus that determines the sugar content in the fruit (especially by measuring grape musts).
Fortunately, the tables make the numbers easier.
The production of ice cream no longer requires as much physical effort as before.
It does not only help the machine to produce the basic material automatically.
There is also a device that mixes the finished ice cream mixture into the cream at the same time and cools to a minimum temperature.
Despite all the automation, we will not avoid small accidents.
The Brazilian Gustavo suffocates himself and his colleagues from top to bottom with a fruit pie when a huge mixer is out of his control.
“In every course,” thinks Maestro Luciano, “it is only a matter of time when something like this happens.”
Auditors in Dual Light
The European Food Authority (EFSA) is linked to an industry experimenting with genetic plants.
This accusation has now been made by a group of experts at Testbiotech, which is considered an independent biotechnology impact assessment institute.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well," Testbiotech chief Christoph Then said Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the EFSA group of experts on genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another EFSA expert have been contracting with the Ilsi lobbyists for several years.
It is funded by companies such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has been decisively involved in the EFSA’s genetic plant control regulations and is thus in a clear conflict of interest, criticises Then.
The EFSA regulations are said to be consistent in the entire paragraphs with the Ilsi documents and thus bear the manuscript of the industry, which should be checked by an authority in Parma, Italy.
This is the second time Testbiotech has warned of conflicts of interest.
Recently, a senior manager from the EFSA passed without any additions or transitional periods to the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta – and thus changed sides.
Radio for Central Germany (MDR) has also revealed a recent link between EU staff and the Industrial Lobby Control Office, sparking interest in both the Ministry of the Environment and EU Members.
In the meantime, the EFSA cannot recognize the conflict of interest.
It works with all the serious data, i.e. also those in the industry, if they are of high professional quality, is stated in one statement.
Experts working for EFSA are not required to have no contact with the industry.
But he has to prove it.
Kuiper acknowledges his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
It is referred to as a neutral forum of experts from science, industry and politics – among other things for estimating the risk of biotechnology without a lobbyist’s contract.
Independent experts such as Then have criticized the fact that genetically modified plants are currently allowed in animals without any attempt to feed, and that genetic reactions of plants to environmental impacts are not being tested.
“We want to know, for example, what genetically modified maize will do in the field,” says Then.
The current practice is only to test isolated proteins and not the entire genetic plant, which will not prove reliable results.
"If they are not looking for risks, how could they be found?" asks the plaintiff.
Angelika Hilbeck agrees with that.
She has been studying genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical University of Zurich.
In this area, industry is trying to influence or discredit critical scientists as well as in the US, now in Europe as well.
Therefore, there are almost no scientists who are not connected to the group.
Most of the time, studies that are critical to society are not published.
“Industry controls security research,” Hilbeck believes.
The Foot of Stones
Uli Gsell also got some, a total of about 400 kilograms.
On Monday night, he stood in front of the Stuttgart train station, with a tube on his back.
It was a demonstration.
It's snowing.
The story is known: In September, the Baggers arrived and began to tear a large piece of the northern wing.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: thousands were protesting against the S21, a billion-dollar reduction in stations.
When the construction was stopped, most of the wings lay in stubble.
Broken to 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Wax from Crailsheim, a soft rough stone used in the years 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He secured a few of these pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"He must not disappear."
It says, "Cheap and poor stone, simple and original."
When one cuts, it smells like cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what he's going to do with those pieces.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell as well.
A stone footpath from Stuttgart leads to the forest near Tübingen at the former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
A 44-year-old man trades old stones.
He bought all of the pieces that came out during the burglary in Stuttgart.
“It would be a shame if they were scraped on the gravel or disappeared at the landfill,” she says in her office, a wooden building that was once a guard house.
He says he was being bullied and threatened when in September it was reported in all the newspapers that he had bought the remnants of the northern wing from a demolition company.
He has been talking to S-21 fighters all day.
And he explained to them that after the demolition he could not at all.
And when that happens, it’s the most reasonable thing to use the stones.
Then they took about 200 S-21 opponents each about 80 kilograms of heavy block, the price for a piece of 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a reminder, some also in the hope that it will be restored during the rebuilding.
Rongen bought 500 tons, the cargo of 25 large trucks.
Almost half is still in the woods, the rest is sold long ago.
Gardeners, landscape gardeners, builders of houses.
They came from all corners and pulled what was in the trunk and on the trailer.
The stones of controversy from Stuttgart have long been transformed into "sands" or as the edges of herbs.
"This stone is really nothing special," says Rongen.
"If it weren't for the political upheaval."
He sits in his field car and goes for a ride through his 20-hectare kingdom.
He studied law first, discontinued his studies, later in biology, then became interested in computers and eventually became a stone trader.
And a lover of stones.
It has 40,000 tons of stones stored.
He weighs his treasures from all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest dealer with old stones in the republic.
Brakes.
In the snow lies artificially developed sandstones.
"One belonged to the Marien Bridge in Dresden," he says.
The sandsmith from Labe, yellow, warm, is excited.
"My favorite stone."
We continue our way up through the woods.
Points to the pile: red sandstone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe railway station.
And so on.
"Beautiful travertin."
Once upon a time, the squares belonged to the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow lies the stones and stories, the Cannstatt-travertin from the police office in Stuttgart, the red granite from St. Blasien’s temple, the tuft from the hospital in Heilbronn.
What a job, what an effort, what a sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how the stones were broken by hand and transported using simple candy and bull carts, he becomes completely respectful.
"It would be a scandal if something like that collapsed."
He wasn’t rich, he wasn’t rich at all.
Today, however, the stone trader employs 14 people, and in the top of the forest, there was a stonemaker, a sculptor, a forger, a glassman and a gardener.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the one who evaluates the remains.
He'll have to go to Cologne soon.
The stones will also be saved there.
The Battle of Talents for High-Potentials
There are a lot of people in the dining room.
16 students are pressed with breadcrumbs with salmon, tomato soups and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and Volkswagen car manufacturer invited students of engineering and design to the workshop.
Together with VW’s developers, they are here to talk about the car of the future – and by the way, to get to know Volkswagen.
Many companies are trying to succeed in the race for the smartest heads, as well as VW, and are betting on cooperation with universities.
Their mission is to recruit the most talented graduates in auditoriums as soon as possible, even before they enter the labour market and will be interested in others.
Since universities do not issue any lists of successes of their students, companies are trying to uncover outstanding talents in practice-oriented projects and acquire them.
At TU Braunschweig, the automotive group is trying to gain talent the next day.
One young lady from the personal department distributes props, rubber bears and boards with the VW logo.
It tells hopeful young talents about internship programs, student employment and indicates their journeys to the group.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig takes care of the project together with VW.
They see the benefits for both sides: "Students will get in touch with the industry and gain experience."
“VW can simultaneously get to know students, get to know interesting candidates and think about who would fit as a collaborator.”
Such cooperation, according to Selle, is not unusual.
But the news is that he is so openly fighting for his students.
“Otherwise, it was an essential professional project,” says Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates will probably be even harder.
In many sectors, companies are no longer able to select their employees from long lists of candidates.
On the contrary, they must endeavor to attract a particularly highly qualified workforce.
In particular, graduates in engineering disciplines have an excellent negotiating position.
According to the German Engineers’ Association VDI, 40,000 engineering positions remained unoccupied in October.
And according to the predictions of the VDI, the so-called shortage of engineers is still growing.
After the audit and advisory firm KPMG, Roman Dykta goes to the talent hunt.
It organizes challenging Recruiting-events, such as KPMG-Race, a kind of modern treasure race, in which participants must find their way according to GPS coordinates.
The company plans to send eight promising students to the U.S. next year.
Participants can also visit KPMG branches and get acquainted with the company.
In advance, it will be decided in two rounds who will participate.
Only Crème de la Crème from many interested ones will fly to the US.
In the fight for High Potentials at universities, according to Dikta, increasingly tough laws will apply.
"We want to be different with our race from the others."
"A one-stop sailing trip was too little for us."
Dykta's talent hunter seems to be lucky.
“We stayed in touch with all the participants of a similar event last year.”
"Some will soon finish their studies and plan to apply for a job with us," he says.
In addition to direct on-campus addressing, especially small and medium-sized companies are presented classically in the labour markets.
"We are trying to contact graduates at professional exhibitions."
"For example, at Intersolar," said Sitha Stübe, head of the staff department of Solarworld.
The company from Bonn employs about 1,500 people in Germany.
Stübe knows the problem with young workers.
Currently, 35 positions are posted on the company’s website.
"Currently, it's difficult to occupy vacancies."
“It costs a lot of time and money,” he says.
Another option is contact through professors at universities.
Solarworld collaborates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors inform that it is possible for us to do an internship or write a diploma thesis."
Solar specialists do not organize any expensive promotional events.
Instead, the company tries to attract other advantages: personal atmosphere, low hierarchy and light communication.
“Great corporations often don’t offer it,” says the head of the personal department of Stübe.
When looking for a job, money has not played a major role for a long time.
Flexible working hours, child care or good practice options are other decisive factors.
Solarworld ranked 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany in a study by the Great Place to Work Institute.
The Institute compiles an annual list of the best German employers.
In addition, it asks employees how satisfied they are with their work and work environment and monitors the framework conditions of the employees.
The head of Stübe’s personal department hopes that the placement will bring points to the job seekers.
"I think the interested parties are particularly informed about the external evaluations of a potential employer," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
It advises its customers to be more authentic.
And, according to Mr Kriegler, this means, above all, internal measures.
“The best way to become visible as an attractive employer is through your own employees,” he says.
Professionally, this is called internal Employer Branding, i.e. the promotion of an employer in the market within its own employees.
“Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors.”
If the company takes good care of its people and they identify with the company, then they will make advertising to their employers among friends and acquaintances.
“It’s like a game with a rope,” Kriegler says.
Obama to Stop New Oil Drills
Over the next few years, no new oil wells will be built off the coast of the U.S.-Florida state in the Gulf of Mexico.
The Washington government has issued a corresponding ban – and thereby repealed the earlier plans with final effect.
Also on the Atlantic coast, new drilling sites have been banned.
Interior Minister Ken Salazar said this on Wednesday.
The reason for the strict ban, which should apply for at least the next five years, is the explosion at the drilling tower "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before this accident, which cost eleven employees’ lives and led to the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama signaled to the pressure of the opposition and industry his willingness to allow new drills in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
Proponents are trying to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil supplies.
To this day, it is not clear who is responsible for the devastating oil disaster in the Gulf.
At the heart of the criticism is the British energy group BP, which is confronted with billions of demands.
The inquiry commission, commissioned by Obama, is expected to submit the results by December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted a drilling ban that had been paid since the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil companies submitted applications for new drilling purposes.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent similar disasters with stricter controls and stricter security regulations.
At the moment, the control authority is fundamentally reforming, which has drawn attention to many corruption allegations.
At the same time, Obama announced that it would abolish lucrative tax evasion opportunities for oil and gas companies.
The industry is now openly warning that stricter regulation will substantially reduce the volume of oil mined in the Gulf.
"Government plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the gas and oil industry," the BDO advisory firm said in a recent survey, before the drilling ban on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance is still complaining about uncertainty in the industry: “No one knows exactly what the regulations are changing.”
Investments in new mining projects are carried out until appeal - at the expense of growth.
Ogoni area burned
The water in the rivers is oil brown, it smells like a pump: billions of liters of unique oil have destroyed nature in the Ogoni region of Nigeria.
People feed on theft, corruption, and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari is good at it.
"Don't be afraid," reassures the environmental activist journalist, "today you get enough oil mud before the lens."
The 37-year-old Nigerian watched an attempt to photograph a boy riding around his chest with water surrounded by squirrels: this scene works in a watery gloss with dusk colors almost beautiful.
The fact that under the surface floating brown oil spills, is not visible.
Earlier she had collected enough garnels in the containers, says Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
In the meantime, the slowly flowing water became completely dead.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil was spilled into a vast, shallow area from a broken pipeline.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo have to sail for at least six hours to get into the waters where fish are: the Ogoni area, located in the heart of the Niger River Delta, is one of the worst flooded areas in the world.
The journey along the river through mangrove basins with many side streams is only noticeable by the entire range of triggers.
The engine on the boat cooks instead of light water with a brown spoon, and whoever dives his hand into the water, pulls the oil fingers.
The roots of the mangrove stick out of the ground like black barley bars, rarely occurring palms leave their leaves sadly hanging.
We are desperately looking for a bunch of birds that are commonly found in wet areas: Once the engine sticks to the boat, they will burst into the former paradise, where it smells like a pump, a terrifying silence.
"What is happening here is the ecological leadership of war," says Celestine Akpobari, "we live in constant fear of health."
Compared to war is justified.
The Ogoni settlement area is a battlefield where it has been fighting for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first conquerors from Europe gathered here, in the 1980s, the first resistance was formed with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa because it was not a safe one, it would have to be a product roster for Shell’s company in 1993.
Today, the company is not allowed to return to the Ogoni area: while it is daily mining from the whole area of the three-size delta of Switzerland with more than 5,000 mining holes and 7000 kilometres of conducting more than two million barrels of black gold, the oil field in the Ogoni area is located in the Ogoni lade.
Every few hundred meters, the water bars of the steel structure like bizarre sculptures: "Christmas trees", so they are called the heads of the drill holes very gently.
They're 50 years old, most of them dead to death.
At any moment such a head of a drill hole breaks, Akpobari tells, and then a constant stream of oil flows into the water.
Experts estimate that more than two billion litres of oil has flown into the delta in 50 years: each year, the amount of oil that has flown into the Alaska sea in the crash of the "Exxon Valdez" supertanker 21 years ago - one of the biggest environmental disasters in human history.
There are disputes over who is responsible for the continuing ecological disaster.
While the Shell Group labels sabotage and theft of oil for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmentalists say the breaking heads of drills and insulating pipelines are the main cause.
Shell requires much less safety regulations in Nigeria than in the world's habits, the group said in 2008 U.S. scientist Richard Steiner: "Only the number of faults on the lines is said to be "multiple times higher than elsewhere."
In a place that looks from a distance like a deserted, oil-soaked workshop under the wide sky, the character emerges from the mangroves: they are completely naked and up to the neck from the oil.
Under one of the many vessels, which are partly connected by the leadership, partly scattered arbitrarily across the land, the fire is burning: illegal small refineries.
Oil is heated in the court over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the group’s leader.
The front leaks out of the pipeline into the catchment tank of gasoline, later the cap at the end of the pipeline of kerosene and finally petrol.
In this way, Michael and his four colleagues produce up to four barrels of 300 liters a day: "We make 34,000 Naira" - about <0x24>22.
The population of the delta is exploiting the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil state in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The ridiculously low price of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>40 per litre of oil can still be overtaken by illegal producers because they have raw materials free of charge.
It comes from the "bunkers" that connect to the leadership everywhere in the Ogoni region: according to experts, the country is losing at least 16 million litres of oil per day in the whole area of the Niger delta.
But only a negligently small portion of the provisionally stored raw materials will be illegally sold: the largest share will be filled by organized criminal networks, which must include politicians and high-ranking army representatives, into tankers and sell them on the world market.
The debate on whether the population has caused the disaster and their interventions or the lax method of production is considered by Akpobari as purely academic.
“If the oil companies weren’t considered an intruder, and if they didn’t destroy the life of the fishermen perfectly, then there would be no sabotage, no robbery and illegal refineries.”
In the meantime, however, Ogoni's relationship with Shell is so undermined that it only takes into account the Group's departure: "Maybe other nations will turn out to be better than the Chinese."
Michael is disturbed.
"It's time to disappear," says the muscle manufacturer.
"At any moment, soldiers can come."
If they're found by a special military unit, they're not in jail, but they're in pain.
Also, soldiers who mostly come from the north of the country - like all Nigerians - want to profit from the raw materials.
“The damned thing has gotten our land in all respects to the bottom,” Akpobari says.
Investigators discover a dangerous construction error in A380 engines
The A380 apparently has a major security flaw.
Investigators discovered during the inspection of the machine, which landed in an emergency, a possible construction error that could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
Qantas wants to sue engine manufacturers.
Qantas airbus passengers may have been more fortunate to land in early November than previously known: the Australian Aviation Safety Authority has detected a major safety flaw in the engines of some A380 engines during its investigations - and is now warning against the condition of the A380.
The failure may have serious consequences: cracks due to wear and tear could occur on a single oil compound, ATSB said in a statement on Thursday.
This could lead to a “disastrous engine failure.”
These are engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce in 20 A380 series aircraft.
Among them is the Qantas airbus, which had to land in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
She filed a lawsuit with the Australian Federal Court in Sydney, allowing further legal action against the company.
Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said his company would seek compensation for the incident in early November.
During the engine fire, parts were released and they damaged the loading area.
Rolls-Royce called the cause of the damage to the burning oil.
After this event, up to 40 engines have to be replaced around the world.
Australian investigators have announced that they will carry out further safety tests with giant aircraft equipped with the engines in question.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan said.
The safety deficiency has been deemed sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the airline left its A380 fleet on the ground for several weeks.
Singapore Airlines has left three of its eleven A380s temporarily on the ground.
Lufthansa replaced an A380 engine as a safety measure.
The two-story aircraft is the largest passenger plane in the world.
National snowstorm causes chaos in traffic
The whole of Germany in white: almost the whole country overnight snowed.
On many roads there is chaos, the connections of trains and planes are disrupted.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter freezes Germany: Almost the entire republic fell in the night on Thursday with frozen temperatures of snow - leading to traffic chaos in many places.
In some places up to 15 centimeters of snow lies in the north and east.
On several highways and many roads there is very limited traffic.
On the A7 near Flensburg, the road service was still deployed, but it was unable to cope with new snow.
There was still a strong impact wind over the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Bureau of Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) expects a stormy arrival on the Baltic Sea coast in Schleswig-Holstein this morning with a water condition of 1.2 meters above normal.
Snowfall in Saxony has caused significant problems on highways and state roads.
According to the central bad weather Meteomedia, therefore, in Saxon Switzerland the level of the purple alarm was the highest ever.
In part, 30 centimeters of new snow was thought of, strong and fresh winds caused the curtains.
Several trucks and passenger cars remained there at night.
In Saxony-Anhalt, police have also reported major road accidents.
The A2 was caused by the wind and snow slow operation and constipation.
Durynsk has had problems with snow on the A4 and A9.
According to the German trail, there are major difficulties in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Durynsk and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on the tracks, inverted trees on the tracks or broken tops and slopes.
Long-distance traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped in Saxony.
Saalfeld had to stop one ICE in Munich.
165 passengers were taken by train from firefighters and rescuers to get woolen blankets, food and drinks.
The snow wind blows across the road.
Many flights have been cancelled at major German airports due to snow winds.
According to a spokesman for the flight information center, flights cancelled from Munich have already been reported.
In Frankfurt, Mohan has been cancelled for 40 years, according to a spokesman for Fraport.
Road maintenance is in constant deployment.
Although there are few passengers left at the airport, 400 field beds are ready for them.
There were many accidents on the roads on Wednesday evening.
Last night, a truck driver died in a train crash on a railway crossing in eastern Hol<0xC5><0xA1>tynsk.
The driver was slightly injured.
A similar accident occurred near Nuremberg because of the snowy road: a truck was also caught on a railway crossing because the vehicle was trapped.
The driver is dead.
Four passengers were injured on the train, leaving the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg closed until morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after turning her car on a skating road near Aschaffenburg.
The meteorologists have good news, however, that the snow will remain in the form of light rain, which is why it will rise even when the wind is mild.
But the wind will weaken.
Only by the Baltic Sea there will be rapid winds of storm power.
But it will be a big cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for buyers for twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to say goodbye with its sign: according to one newspaper post, the bank is looking for a buyer for two towers with offices in its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could cost up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>500 million.
Deutsche Bank has just renovated its headquarters for the group: twin towers in the Frankfurt banking district have been modernised; in the meantime, bankers have been reluctant to return to their old jobs.
Now, however, the financial group apparently wants the cost of renovation back – and is looking for buyers for both clouds, the Financial Times Deutschland reports, appealing to the spokesman.
The spokesperson did not specify the reasons for the planned sale.
“We’re still investigating whether it makes more sense to own or sell a property and then rent it again,” he said.
In this way, Germany’s largest credit institution resigns after a short period of time from its corporate headquarters.
The bank took over the twin towers only in mid-2007 for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>272 million from the investors of its own fund and subsequently renovated them costly.
Energy conversion combined, according to data, around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 million.
The sale would probably bring a lot of money to the bank.
Experts in the field estimate the value of the towers renamed "Greentowers" for around 500 million euros, according to the newspaper text.
The spokesman said it was not decided whether the building would be sold again to the fund’s assets or to an independent investor.
Thousands of mourners for the dead miners
More than 10,000 people revered the memorial of the buried miners in New Zealand, who were declared dead after several explosions in the mine.
The dead were still unable to be released, as the security situation in the chess continues to be complicated.
Almost two weeks ago, a powerful explosion occurred in the Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were sunk in the mine.
A probe was launched into the shipyard where the accident occurred, but found no trace of life.
Due to high concentrations of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, the rescue forces were unable to land for safety reasons.
After the second powerful detonation, authorities and experts came to the conclusion that the miners no longer had any chance of survival.
He still hasn't been able to release the dead.
They now honor the memorial of the dead relatives and friends.
In Greymouth on the southern island of New Zealand, 10,000 people gathered in the sunny weather.
They were silent for two minutes.
29 tables were built to commemorate the memorial of the dormant miners, on which were helmets, lamps and names of miners.
Images and personal items such as clothes and surfboards have also found their place here.
The flags of the state government were half-jokeed.
New Zealand hoped that the miners would come out again from the "depths of the country" to the surface, New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told participants of the commemorative event.
"But they never came home."
He can't say goodbye to his son until he sees his dead body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in a cave.
The commemorative event took place in addition to the Prime Minister and the relatives of several foreign diplomats.
During the November 19 explosion, British and South African miners were also invaded.
Rescuers began by burning a fire inside a coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
Once toxic gases are released, high temperature cooling inside the mine will begin, police president Gary Knowles told reporters.
Go to hell, warriors!
Is Horror Suitable for Art Cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn tries to break down the old border with his fighting epic "Walhalla Rising".
What kind of audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when he filmed Wallalla Rising?
A captured Viking warrior with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his torturers and kills his opponents almost with supernatural force - it sounds ideal for young male spectators who are looking for bloody action, because they don't want to beat our hero behind the wheels.
On the other hand, one eye, as it is actually called, does not say a word during the entire film, and even the other characters will utter at least one or two sentences or be dragged to the passionate dying screams.
Otherwise, it is quiet and crawling in the terribly beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland, which offers the scenery of the Viking world about a thousand years ago.
The film is ideal for adult cinema enthusiasts with an interest in existentialism and very quiet camera footage.
It’s good when a movie has multiple target groups, it’s just a shame when they’re excluded from each other.
The director Winding Refn, after filming his wild and stylized trilogy of drug dealers "Pusher", is considered a Danish version of director Quentin Tarantin, but is stoically preventing his works from getting closer to the mainstream audience with humor.
Most of the fans of art cinema are likely to be distracted everywhere by the squirming brain and the inside.
Fans of the action movies are ignoring at the latest when One-Eyed, for reasons that are unexplained, arrives with a group of violent Christian missionaries on a ship to Jerusalem and stays forever in the wind and fog until apparently the man falls into the mist.
So it’s no wonder that Wallalla Rising didn’t get to the cinemas in Germany and was now only released on DVD.
It’s a shame, mainly because of the beautiful shots, but also because behind the special façade, places that are so crowded with blood, it hides an exciting cinema that deserves a bit of attention.
This film is not about dialogue or precise action, it is all an atmosphere, a hot dream that has become a film.
And that's not for the spectator to escape.
Refn doesn’t even enjoy a moment of relaxation and slowly breathes him with his frozen images and a cloudy hypnotic soundtrack, above all but indescribable hatred that exudes from the heart of the characters.
Only the little blonde boy who helps the One-Eyed will keep something like innocence, all the others are driven by evil.
Of all the most one-eyed heroes whose motives will never be explained, who will become a time for enemies and transitional allies a warrior from hell, perhaps an envoy of the devil.
It's devastating, but it's only for the corrupt.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, for anger, excitement and admiration.
Experience.
Mysterious Earthworks
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has issued a new alert to a secret nuclear program in Syria.
However, the country is prevented from expressing - and will not allow control.
Around midnight, from September 5 to 6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets will attack a mysterious square building in Syria.
It stands on the banks of the Euphrates River; the nearest largest city is 30 kilometres away and is called Dair as-Saur.
The documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reveal its name when it comes to a reactor that allegedly built Syria with the help of North Korea in this square hidden in a valley that turns away from the current.
Based on a statement by the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Agency (CIA) in late April 2008, a reactor, also known as the nearby village of el-Kibar, was well suited for the production of plutonium – from which nuclear weapons could be built.
The technology of the 1950s doesn’t fit anything else.
The CIA presented a video with unfocused satellite images.
By means of computer animation, she clarified where the components of the reactor could have been before being destroyed, to be a reduced copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear center.
In addition, photographs were also presented that showed the building near or even from the inside.
The reactor was said to have been launched shortly before, but still without fuel cells.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, they do not know much more than that time, even the puzzles have increased over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently announced in his memoirs that before the attack, the CIA was very sure that Syria was building an el-Kibar reactor, but essentially had no evidence that there was an “active nuclear program” in the country.
Some intelligence services in Europe are even more cautious and talk only about a “probable reactor,” even though the CIA’s presentations are considered “worthy.”
They lack clear evidence, just like the IAEA.
Asked how sure he is that he has a reactor in front of him, a senior UN diplomat said in the summer that the IAEA has “sufficient material to ask questions.”
The allegedly "unused military building" was quickly dismantled by the Syrians and also properly leveled the ground.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team led by former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of human-made uranium in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite photographs of commercial vendors from the very aftermath of the attack, which should be more exhilarating than those presented by the CIA.
Unfortunately, these images are not on the market because they were purchased exclusively by an unknown customer – perhaps Israel.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot confirm their authenticity.
Syria has always claimed that it has never had a secret nuclear program, nor has it built a reactor.
Uranus comes from Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
This was reversed by the IAEA after the particle analysis.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss the matter - as well as satellite images.
In addition, he banned the auditors from second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the detonated buildings.
Israel is also silent.
"We will never comment on this," said Ehud Olmert, the then-governing Prime Minister.
The investigation of this case has been inconsequentially ongoing since June 2008 and is "growing into a serious problem due to the credibility of the Office", as admitted by a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna - after all, it is a serious violation of the contracts, which are banned from the IAEA.
The IAEA considers the key to progress in the case of another three devices, which are to be "functionally connected" to the supposed reactor - and unlike it, they still exist.
The auditors have not yet said which devices are in question, which ones have a function or why they are suspected.
According to Süddeutsche Zeitung, the IAEA internally designates as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, derived again by nearby cities.
The Independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (ISIS) identified these objects and found on satellite images a complex of buildings, which is probably one of the suspected objects.
Apparently, it is located inside or near the military base – precisely for this reason, Syria refuses access to these three sites by the IAEA.
In Vienna, it was heard that the Syrians were afraid of the so-called fishing expedition – that the IAEA would have been sent to the United States in advance to search for military bases.
Nuclear detectives were alerted to the device by the U.S. Secret Service.
The IAEA has records, as well as satellite images, that material was being transported between these three places and a square near the Euphrates.
In Vienna, a senior Western diplomat said that at least one set should be “in connection with fuel production”.
However, there is "no evidence of sensitive activities", i.e. of enrichment of uranium and new processing; processes necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is powered by uranium, which is not enriched.
However, where uranium comes from and where plutonium should be removed from it later on, there are only likely estimates on these central issues.
It is also not known whether pieces that could hide important traces are stored in these three places.
The Jacobs disappeared from the surface of the land of a hundred trucks, no one seems to have any information about where the suction got.
Just a few kilometres away from el-Kibar and on the other side of the Euphrates, the al-Tibni salt mine, which allowed Syria to check in 1998 as a suitable storage facility for radioactive waste, the IAEA considers unlikely.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley put it in contact with the reactor in a satellite image analysis for the renowned Jane's Intelligence Review.
Images from space, however, show that after the IAEA demanded access, Syria carried out groundwork in all suspicious locations and removed large containers.
It could have been a coincidence, but it didn't help clarify the suspicion.
In addition, diplomatic circles say the IAEA has spent many months drawing up a plan for auditors to allow Syria to keep any military secrets – only that effort shows how much interest the auditors have.
In the meantime, Damask also rejected the proposal.
If a year ago western diplomats in Vienna had reassured that the reactor had been destroyed, and that's why it's not burning, U.S. Ambassador Glyn Davies has been talking about the so-called special inspections, which is one of the hardest means to check.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose inspections, has already talked about "the possibilities I will avoid in the future", but he is still hesitant.
This choice poses a great risk: On the one hand, a majority of the IAEA Governing Council is needed to do so, and many of the 35 countries represented are definitely not interested in escalating.
On the other hand, as one diplomat warns: "What happens if they finally find nothing?"
Love in Time of War
Since Angelina Jolie started working on a still nameless directorial original in the summer, there have been problems.
She wrote the script herself, it is a love story of a woman from Bosnia and a man from Serbia.
Much more is not known yet – but it also causes discomfort.
It is said that the Muslim woman fell in love with the Serbian man who raped her during the war in Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women’s associations immediately protested, so the planned filming was quickly moved from Sarajevo to Hungary.
In the meantime, the film has been filmed in Hungary and is in post-production, but it is still protesting in Bosnien-Herzegovina.
Bakira Hasecic of the Women’s War Victims Organization (WWF) wrote through UNHCR to Jolie to help refugees and asked for a meeting with the actress, the Bosnian newspaper now reported - Jolie is also the UN refugee aid ambassador.
It’s not exactly diplomatic – she offered women a week ago in Hungary, but they refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
In camps where he was raped, love stories were not completed, and Jolie's attitude towards the victim reveals enough about the script.
Her organization has therefore recommended the UN refugee assistance organization to release Jolie as an ambassador, the Guardian reports.
What kind of scenes did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which was able to read her script, allowed after minor harassment in Sarajevo filming - it is not entirely clear why Jolie did not come.
The young author stresses that she does not follow any political intentions in her film, that she has devoted herself with great effort to the conflict in Yugoslavia, that she wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give room to all parties involved.
Due to the content, it remains uncertain.
Another version of the film sounds really different on the internet: lovers knew each other before the war began and meet again when she is like a Bosnian Muslim woman trapped in a Serbian camp where he serves as a guard.
That really sounds quite different than “the victim of rape falls in love with his torturer.”
The fact that the film Jolie really begins before the war - is true.
Jolie argues that pressure is being put on her, which is "unfair and based on misinformation."
Now she can be released by hackers from Hollywood: by publishing her script illegally on the internet, as they have done so many times.
Nothing but away.
It's good for the Irish again tonight.
Not a trace of sadness.
The domestic team dominates strongly over its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA.
Fans shout joy for the sound of loud music, with their ass on their feet.
The Bailey-Pub in South Cork is hot as players throw tennis balls three meters into beer bowls – and hit each other.
"Beer pong" is called a bizarre theater and it is possible to win 500 euros as a winning prize and tickets to Las Vegas for the World Beer pong Championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this screaming beer game and a reluctant computer scientist, it doesn’t really fit together.
Still, a 26-year-old man tries to have fun, responding to the heavier question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not to play a passion in Las Vegas, he goes to an interview in New Zealand in January.
“I have such a strange feeling,” he says.
"It's so far away and I don't have work there yet."
Still: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she immediately got her dream job as an Eventmanager, maybe it's a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Due to bad prospects at home, two of the Tanner’s three siblings have already tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now holds a position as an IT consultant in London.
Boys leave: As with the Tanners, it looks like in many families on the island.
100,000 IR will leave the country in the near future, experts at the ESRI Institute for Economic and Social Affairs in Dublin predict.
They are expected to have 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
For such a small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, this is a major loss.
If the forecasts are confirmed, there will be a similar wave of migration as Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After decades of ascension, which brought great prosperity to the Irish, the inconvenience is now expanding again.
The economic crisis affects above all young, educated Irish people, who have so far only experienced a rise.
The loss of employment and social decline seemed absurd in the boom of these years.
Everyone was needed, the money was wasted.
In the meantime, three out of ten women and men under the age of thirty are without work.
In the Irish Times, there are many letters from readers who complain: "In Ireland, everything comes from the hill."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - who can, that one goes away and our country loses an entire generation."
"Let the last one go, please."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, the president of the Irish Student Union, sees the future black because the government says it is only lying and offers young people no prospects for the future.
“They reduce the minimum wage, but they have no strategy to create new jobs,” the 20-year-old says.
She observes how her colleagues move from one unpaid practice to another.
Her biggest concern is that she will have to emigrate in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon are trying to see the subject in a positive way.
McLarnon organizes "WorkingAbroadExpo", an exhibition that offers a comprehensive service on work abroad.
“For beginners in the job market, working abroad is an excellent opportunity to take the first steps on the career ladder,” says the manager.
On his website are photographs of surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a galley, but freedom and joy.
Sean O’Donovan has been aware of what it’s like to build something somewhere else for six months.
Since the 29-year-old engineer had no job in Ireland, he is now employed together with 15 Irish colleagues at construction in Germany.
He's just building a fashion house in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he continues to Hanover or Berlin for another project.
In the meantime, O’Donovan rarely gets home because he works in extra shifts to pay off a house-to-house loan.
“The situation is sometimes really a little crazy,” she says, when for the first time in a long time she crosses the threshold of her own home.
“I’m making money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I’m not at all.”
He laughs desperately and walks in cool rooms.
The small house stands in a good neighborhood with maintained gardens, big expensive cars are parked in the driveways.
O’Donovan bought the house with his sister four years ago for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>380,000 – 100 percent loan-funded.
“It was a crazy time, simple money was without a lot of questions,” he says.
Is he afraid that the loan will not work out well?
O'Donovan thinks for a moment, down a hot tea and says, "I don't have kids to feed and I'm young; even if it all turns out, I can start all over again."
A construction engineer doesn't like the grievances he hears so often now.
“No one needs to starve – our situation is not as dramatic as it used to be on this island,” he says.
"Even though we work abroad, that's not the worst thing that can happen - maybe we'll just feel like the Irish."
He laughs and then tells the story of his father who left for England in the last economic crisis.
"After seven years, he was back again and life in Ireland continued, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Let yourself be open to the future and simply wait for life to evolve elsewhere.
He has been working in London for several years now, and why shouldn’t it be good for him and his girlfriend?
But there is one more thing that worries him a lot these days: celebrating his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
They're afraid she might turn around for a farewell party.
"Mostly no emotions," she says and drinks a lot of beer.
"Goodbye, that sounds disturbing."
"Let's call it a celebration of leaving, quite simply, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
Common Practices of Democracy
The support of democracy in Latin America is growing, as is the support of private enterprise.
Criminal activity is more worrying than unemployment.
And Brazil considers many regions more influential than the United States.
These are some of the results of the current Latinobarometer survey, which took place in 18 countries and was published exclusively in The Economist magazine.
Since the survey has been conducted regularly since 1995, it can monitor changes in attitudes across the region.
This year’s survey, which took place in September and early October, dominated two related matters.
The first is that Latin America is in a relatively happy mood.
The second is to increase the stability of attitudes towards democracy and its key institutions.
Support for democracy in several countries on the outskirts of the Pacific in South America has increased significantly (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy recovered after a deep decline in production last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous regions, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Figure 2).
Approximately 44% of respondents across the region expressed their satisfaction with the way democracy works in practice in their country, it is the same number as last year, but compared to 2001, when it was 25%, it is a big increase (Chart 3).
Approximately 34% said they trust the parliament in their own country and 45% trust the government, again the same numbers as last year, but it’s a big difference compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, the economic crisis in Latin America undermined democracy.
Support was created during the global financial crisis, probably because many Latin American countries suffered only a short recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, a stronger social security network has helped protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America announced this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only negligiblely in 2009 and again fell to 32% this year.)
However, the mood changes in a wide spectrum from country to country (see Figure 4).
Brazil’s strong economic performance and the popularity of its retiring President Luiza Inácia Luly da Silva are reflected in a broadly accepted sense of progress.
This situation is more rare in Mexico and Central America, where the recession has been more serious and the state of violent crime has worsened.
It is only the second time that surveys have been conducted that more respondents across Latin America see crime as the most important problem rather than unemployment (see Figure 5).
Approximately 31% say they or their relatives became victims of crime last year, but that’s a drop compared to 38% from last year and is also the lowest since 1995.
Massive economic performance is reflected in the growing support for private enterprise and the market economy: approximately 71% of respondents across the region say that private enterprise is necessary for development, this percentage rose from 56% in 2007 (see Figure 6).
Approximately 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, this percentage rose from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela have the same opinion (and 80% support private business there), although their left-wing president Hugo Chávez owns many private companies.
Brazil is the country that has a leading position in the region, as mentioned by 19% of respondents (against 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, compared to last year unchanged) and Venezuela (9%, compared to 11% last year).
However, the United States is considered the most influential country of respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, with Venezuela enjoying success in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Criticized Elections
No one expected that the general election in Haiti on November 28 would be perfect.
But they were much worse than outsiders trying to help the affected country to fear.
Elections were filled with urns and repeated voting, ballots scattered across channels, broken polling stations and intimidation.
Elections are open after hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including many who were relocated due to the January earthquake, were wandering around and trying to figure out where to go to vote.
Some of them eventually gave up.
More than ten presidential candidates, including several presumed predecessors, shouted that it was fraud and called for the cancellation of the election.
Protests, some of them violent, spread across the country.
Yet Edmond Mulet, a high-ranking UN official in Haiti, said it was "a pretty good choice in many respects."
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community said cautiously that “they do not believe that these irregularities, no matter how serious, did not necessarily cancel the process.”
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral body, whose opposition votes are tied to René Préval, the unpopular retired president and his candidate Jude Célestin, is due to announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected decisive battle is scheduled for January.
Not all electoral hopes are lost.
The two leading opposition candidates Michel Martelly, rapper and Mirlande Manigat, the former first lady, resigned from their original call for voting to be declared invalid.
The problem, however, may arise if Mr Célestin, who has little or no voter support, is identified by the electoral commission for having achieved a decisive fight.
Due to the cholera epidemic and more than 1 million people still living in tents after the earthquake, there were fears that election participation would be low.
Eventually, many Haitians wanted to vote, but due to disorganization, they were prevented from doing so.
Approximately 250,000 ID cards, which are necessary for voting, remained undivided shortly before the election.
There's a lot at stake.
The donors see the choice of a legitimate and popular government as a crucial step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
So it is clear that the Haitians are going to do it themselves.
After the peaks to the center
In the weeks when she was suddenly widowed, Argentine president Cristina Fernández has benefited from the sympathy of the public, when her popularity has increased from 20 to over 50%, the highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Yet turning this success into a successful campaign for a second term in next year’s elections may depend on whether the sad woman Fernández will give up the uncompromisingness of her deceased husband, predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
And on these signs, everything will be based.
Mr Kirchner, who continued economic policy even after his wife successfully became president, had a habit of drawing up budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend additional income according to their will.
Mrs Fernández’s government lost a majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition split and was further destabilised when Mr. Kirchner died of a heart attack on October 27.
Some members of the ruling Peronist political movement have joined Ms. Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (in which the government was faked and accused of corruption), Congress was unable to approve the 2011 budget.
"I don't want to go," said the president.
The 2010 budget will now also be paid for next year, with the president having more room to spend according to her will.
The economy is overheating: it is likely to grow by as much as 9% this year.
The official rate of inflation now reaches 11.1%, but many private estimates and trade unions are talking about a figure that is close to 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who joined the office in 2003, when Argentina narrowed down the economic collapse, set a priority for growth and poverty reduction, rather than inflation control.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, harassed the private sector and cleared INDEC, the statistical agency that joined to monitor official inflation statistics.
Can President Fernández now silence this policy?
It called for negotiations between private companies and trade unions.
And its officials say they want to limit wage growth to 18% next year.
The economy was supported by the rise in world export prices of Argentine agricultural products.
But inflation disrupted growth based on major devaluation in 2002.
This may be the reason why President Fernández is making it known that she wants to restore Argentine financial ties with the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government signed an agreement with bondholders, who previously refused to restructure the debt that Argentina did not pay in 2001.
President Fernández is now facing an agreement with creditors governments, which are grouped in the Paris club, which he owes about <0x24>6.7 billion.
Kirchners has always insisted that this fact should not be supervised by the IMF as usual.
But last month, Minister of Economy Amado Boudou announced that the fund will provide "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer price index, which will reminisce of the introduction to the cleanup of INDEC.
It is not yet clear whether President Fernández will want to remain in politics after the end of her term, when her husband is no longer on her side.
If he wants to stay, he needs to get the support of the middle class, which is tired of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their summer holidays in March, the wave of sympathy will fall.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether she will need to give up quietly the many opinions her husband held in politics.
Half Encouragement for China
Taiwanese voters are closer to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother overseas?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of those eligible, voted for mayors and city councils in five urban districts on November 27, which may be considered a broader assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. President Ma himself is a representative of the feelings that dominate the continent and have strong roots in business relations, including the partially free trade agreement, in the largest alignment of relations with China since 1949.
Mr. President Ma passed the test, but only closely.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) ended up winning three out of five mayoral offices, it was not able to win by a majority of votes.
In addition, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is inclined to increase Taiwan’s independence, won nearly 50% of all votes against 45% of the KMT party.
If it were a presidential election, President Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party's share of votes has declined by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP party together with KMT was in the city councils.
Elections were held like the majority of Taiwanese elections, which include noisy election trucks and mass gatherings with banners with barely dressed girls.
It was also a secret attempted assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, the honorary president of KMT, was agitating for KMT candidates on the eve of the election.
A man from the crowd shot young Mr. Lien through his face, wounded her, and killed a spectator.
Bizarrely, it was not determined whether the gunman intended to injure Mr. Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, claims that the shooting affected the election, the suspicion falls on the DPP and leads voters towards the KMT.
The only major winner of the campaign was China.
It was remarkable how the question of the land itself remained in the background.
Instead, the candidates questioned plans for state housing construction and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China’s military threats.
The KMT has a tendency to avoid ties to the government in Beijing.
But this time the DPP has also renounced anti-Chinese attitudes.
It is a reaction to the fact and a realization that China’s trade is essential to Taiwan’s economic survival.
President Ma, for his part, confirmed that China's policy is acceptable to most of Taiwan.
It is expected that the Beijing government will continue to make commercial payments, along with its strategy to bring Taiwan back into the herd.
China did not waste time sending a negotiator to Taipei to organize a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
They’d also like to see political integration, but they’d also like to see post-partum.
It would be better to wait for that after the 2012 presidential election.
In any case, the DPP has revealed itself.
Two years ago, she was at a poor level: her former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on corruption charges.
The president in 2000-08 was a whistleblower and supporter of clear independence.
But under Mrs. Tsai, a new generation has developed, which is moderate and the DPP is working hard to attract experts and young people.
Mrs Tsai was promoted as DPP candidate for president, such as Su Tseng-chang, who held office under Mr Chen.
Their side is now doing everything in its power to show that they can also cooperate with Beijing.
Mrs. Tsai has published plans for research institutes that serve as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their negotiations can take place without prior conditions.
Mrs. Tsai told the Taiwanese public that her party is a "credible alternative" to Mr. Ma's fascinated approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems to be mad at this move.
In a statement from his cell, he expressed the view that DPP candidates would be better off if they insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
But even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will fight for a choice among potential candidates.
KMT is entitled to search for its own people.
Mr Ma's assessments were poor, despite the overwhelming pace of economic growth; the KMT candidates did not want to go to the campaign with him.
Its unpopularity seems to be based mainly on unemployment and deepening collapses between the rich and the poor.
A KMT spokesman says he is reorganizing his cabinet, as well as local branches.
Strongly enforced proposals to support Taiwan for establishing friendly relations are limited.
At the same time, the majority of Taiwanese citizens consider economic integration with China to be inevitable.
According to Antonia Chiang, a prominent publicist, "the point from which there is no return has already passed."
Grammy nomination: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise in the category of best new artist
Speaking at the request of the President and the people must be legally aware.
Esperanza Spalding, a 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer chosen by President Obama to perform at the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, is named one of the Grammy Award surprises this year with a nomination in the category of best new artist.
Since Spalding has been a celebrated character on the jazz scene since 2008, when her album "Esperanza" was released, the nomination came a bit late, but it's in line with the Grammy rules, when the artist can't release more than three albums before she can't "identify her."
Her ambitious 2010 album "Chamber Music Society" certainly took a step forward, and thanks to her carefree vocal style and hard hands with elements of pop, funk and Latin influences, we can talk about the Spalding series as a category of success, which in 2003 was like a success that was recorded by Jonn's best-seller.
The Grammy jury is rightly appreciating the Vijay Iyer Trio "Historicity" in the category of instrumental album, an exciting, refreshing ride of the album, which was a hot favorite last year.
Iyer will compete against the album by experienced saxophonist James Moody "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a New Orleans crappy favorite and a frequent guest on HBO's "Treme" show was awarded in the current jazz category, which is otherwise inclined to the albums of Stanley Clark, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The wild Darcy James Argue's Secret Society with the knowledge of steampunk gained several merited recognitions in the category of large files, when competing was chamber jazz Childs Ensemble and still courageous Dave Holland, whose live album with the octet "Pathways" as an octopus bassist.
Grammy Award nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in the category of classical music
Classical music nominations feature a wide range of musicians and composers from all over the world at the 53rd annual Grammy Awards.
Michael Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra, with five points, and Steve Mackey with his album "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with three points.
Among the nominees for the Southern California band was the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt and his No. 4 Symphony "Los Angeles", a work ordered through the Los Angeles Philharmonic and debuted at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
L.A.-based composer Avner Dorman and his Mandolin Concerto also have a chance to win the award.
Nominations in classical music are divided into 13 categories, which include orchestral, opera, choral and solo recordings.
The category for classical music producers of the year has five nominees, including Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
He was nominated for a classical album by Bruckner and his symphonies No. 3 and 4 from the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" from the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey and his "Dreamhouse" from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project; Verd<0xC3><0xBD>i<0xC5><0x91>a from the "Sacrir<0xC3><0xBD>i Project" and Voquirati Cast.
As for the opera category, the nominees are Berg and "Lulu" from Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse and "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" from Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho and "L'Amour de Loin" from Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin.
Among the composers nominated for the Grammy for contemporary songs are Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina," Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionamentamente Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer."
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 for a performance that was recorded by L.A. Philharmonic under the cover of Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The 30-minute piece is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman and "Mandolin Concerto" were nominated for instrumental soloist performances with the orchestra.
The L.A. composer said he wrote a 15-minute play specifically for mandolin performer Avi Avital, who performed at a concert with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
"I wrote it with the help of tones from the Middle East and many North African rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category for orchestral performance, for the direction of the Chicago Symphony while recording Stravinsky's works.
Among the instrumental soloists nominated were pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; harpist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Among the nominated soloists this year were only women, namely Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchon, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic transition category, she was nominated by soprano Jessye Norman for her recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song."
Planned Mosque in Temecule receives approval of the Planning Commission
The planned mosque in Temecule received unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of often passionate public witness.
Critics have attacked the project that promotes terrorism and will lead to the suspension of trade.
However, the jury decided on Wednesday night that the new religious center is in compliance with local laws and will be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people have come to support this project - Christians, Jews that you will remember," Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Center in Temecula Valley, said on Thursday morning.
"I'm very proud of that as an American citizen."
"It means that justice always wins."
“The opposition is minimal,” he added.
"Those who are against, just scream loudly."
"We have really great people in our valley."
The talks began at six o’clock in the evening and lasted until almost midnight, when discussions with people who were for or against the center took place most of the time. These votes were evenly distributed, Press-Enterprise reports.
The discussion continued on the newspaper’s website.
"There is no longer America," one comment appeared.
"We're a planet of monkeys with the Statue of Liberty falling into the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic Center also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including near Ground Zero, the scene of the tragedy that took place on September 11, 2001, when terrorists attacked New York City.
In Temecula Valley Imam Mahmoud Harmoush condemned violence.
His religious community of about 135 families lived together in Riverside County for years without incident, but he wanted more and more suitable space than the warehouse he rented together with a manufacturer of filter systems.
The new mosque of 24,943 square feet in the Mediterranean style of architecture will also have two minarets and grow to a height of 43 feet.
It is expected to occupy a 4.32-acre site on Nicolas Road, about three kilometres east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal to the city council regarding the project.
Arsenic-resistant microbes increase the possibility of new types of life on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, expands the space to search for new forms of life on Earth and possibly beyond.
Researchers have discovered an unusual bacteria here on Earth and claim that it is a sign that life has opportunities that stand beyond the main elements that have been considered and essential so far.
"This organism has a double ability."
"It can grow either through phosphorus or arsenic."
"This fact is very strange, but it's not proof that it's some sort of really 'alien' life," said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report, which appeared on Thursday in an online issue of Science magazine.
For a long time it has been considered necessary for life six main elements - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
However, scientists have found that the bacteria discovered in Mono Lake, California, are able to continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
"It's going to surprise you at first what's still possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
This finding is significant for the search for life outside the Earth, because researchers need to be able to recognize life and know what life might look like, Anbar said.
The study focuses on microbes found on Earth.
However, the report on the newspaper, published to discuss it, which did not reveal the details of the finding, sparked widespread speculation on the Internet that the report revealed the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
It's not like that.
The discovery "shows that other planetary organisms may be able to use other elements that drive biochemistry and that the set of elements we consider 'standard' may not be so absolutely necessary for life," said Charles Cockell, professor at Planetary and Space Sciences at the Mil Ke Institute.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
“This work is unusual because it shows the replacement of one element with another in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure,” Cockell added.
It wasn't a random find.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Astrobiological Institute, who led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it exhibits high levels of arsenic.
Arzene and phosphorus are chemically very similar elements, so she thought that a microbe exposed to both elements could be able to replace one another.
"Arzene is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is very similar to phosphorus."
"As a result, organisms are very difficult to separate these elements from each other."
"However, arsenic is so different that it doesn't work just like phosphorus. When it gets into the organism, it starts working in biochemical processes," Anbar explained.
Scientists collect bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and expose them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, which bacteria are able to adapt and grow.
Microbes grow better with phosphorus, but since they can also survive with arsenic replacement, there is an increased chance that the form of life that uses arsenic may appear naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or the moon where the arsenic is known.
Jamie S. Foster, a specialist assistant in microbiology at the University of Florida, stated that the idea of arsenic that could be replaced by phosphorus is not new, but there has never been an example of how this fact would prove to be.
Arzen was more common in earlier times on Earth, she said, and so scientists speculated that it could be used by earlier forms of life.
"This suggests there could have been other ways of creating life, not just the way it was created in the early Earth era," said Foster, who was not part of the Wolfe-Simon research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health
Remaining dogs stolen were found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibition dogs that were stolen from Bellflower Motel were found, the Los Angeles Sheriff reported on Thursday.
Four exhibition dogs – two acts and a Welsh pembroke corgis – disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole a 2006 Chevrolet Express van, where they spent a night at the Bellflower 6 motel, officials said.
Two dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon and the remaining two dogs then on Wednesday late in the evening, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles area police department.
"The good news is that the dogs are okay," Whitmore said.
"They're in good condition."
"They were handed over to their rightful owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs were found, in what location, nor did he share detailed information regarding their findings.
"Investigation continues."
"We don't want to talk about it," Whitmore said.
"We follow the rules."
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not caught to comment on the case.
They were very happy when their two acts were found in a shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's representatives found the van and two dogs separately in Compton.
Trace, the three-year-old dog Trace, and 10-month-old Didi were uninjured, authorities said.
But Bunny and Peter, the Welsh Corgi races Pembroke Rickard and Peek, who were planning to take part in regional competitions this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained unscathed until their discovery late Wednesday.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend to attend the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship at Long Beach, where they plan to show Trace.
The other dogs were to compete in other competitions scheduled for the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is just one stop on a couple’s nearly monthly trip to dog exhibitions.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard registered at the motel.
They often sleep in motels and park their car in front of the room window.
They also took three dogs – the boxer’s puppy, the Parson Russell terrier and the British shark – who stayed with them in the motel room.
Pembroke and Welsh Corgis left in the car where it was supposed to be colder.
They opened the windows a bit so that the dogs had enough fresh air in the car.
Peek and Rickard reported the car theft at 6 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said he would offer a reward to anyone who would introduce them to the missing dogs. The dogs have implanted microchips to identify them.
On Thursday, it was unclear whether the awards would be given.
Lev is ready to shout again now that MGM restructuring gets final approval from court
After 18 months of shocks and uncertainties, MGM finally got green to start again.
New York's federal insolvency judge on Thursday officially blessed a "pre-packaged" plan for creditors to settle about <0x24>5 billion in debt and clear the way for an 86-year-old entertainment company that focuses on producing and producing movies and television shows.
With Thursday’s earnings that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy order, MGM remains no legal hurdles to be able to restart Spyglass Entertainment founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who become the study’s chief executives.
The number of employees will fall to approximately 320 from the original more than 400.
MGM will not suddenly emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase agrees on planned financial resources allowing a <0x24>500 million loan to finance new operations and production of MGM.
It is now connected to the investment bank, which itself needs <0x24>75 million, and funding is expected around mid-December.
The restructuring process of the study began in May 2009, when investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise management on how to solve their finances as the management struggled to afford interest payments of <0x24>300 million a year.
In August, President Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, former CEO of Enron and turnover expert, known for his work on Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper’s attempts to solve the financial problems of MGM and 140 creditors of the study took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed to put the company on sale by the end of 2009.
Although the auction attracted several interested parties, none of them were willing to pay <0x24>2 billion plus the finances required by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything was back on the drawing board and the MGM team began working on the restructuring plan. After months of discussions and internal disagreements, the plan was finally approved by the creditors in late October.
When MGM officially retires from bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive multimillion dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received <0x24>1.2 million, will receive a payment of <0x24>9.5 million.
Cooper’s companies, which collect <0x24>375,000 a month for their services that run the company, will receive a reward for success, the so-called “success fee” of <0x24>4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum are planning to resume production at MGM, which released only one film this year and put together a proposal for seven or eight films to be released in early 2012.
They are also planning to participate in the financing of two films, which will feature the book "The Hobbit", together with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to negotiate a special loan between <0x24>265 million and <0x24>275 million to finance its share in the two films that will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM’s debts, was looking to merge the study with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the largest shareholder.
However, the recent negotiations between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Technology Toys That Keep Your Budget on Gifts in Balance
The leading candidate this year is the most amazing iPad toy, followed by the video game system, but in both cases it is a significant interference in the gift budget.
Consider that for the price of one iPad, you can buy five BMX wheels for <0x24>99 and one Kinect game costs as much as 10 beads or about 48 cans of Play-Doh.
But there is a way to keep your budget for gifts in balance.
I recently visited three national toy dealers - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club - and watched which electronic toys I can buy for less than <0x24>80.
It was immediately clear that Moore’s law works; this year’s tech toys have a lot more energy at the same prices, if not slightly lower, compared to previous years.
While relatively few new toys have appeared with affiliated websites, two of the most famous toys of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, offer more.
The number of toys with button batteries increases, as well as toys with charger batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices listed are from Toys "R" Us, except where otherwise specified.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, <0x24>13, from 3 years old) are lipstick animals that sing when you push their belly.
At one touch, the animal releases a tone and the other press begins to create a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing together and harmoniously.
Warning: Once you start cating, you can’t stop.
The best choice in a combination of singing and dancing is Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, <0x24>60, from 2 years old)
Last year, I borrowed from Elmo Live technology a 14-inch animated doll that can play Simon Says and also walk on the moon thanks to its innovative foldable leg with wheel lock.
Kids test Mickey's dance instructor's toy, although their parents complain about a lack of volume control.
If you are a child in the 80s, you may remember Alphie, one of the first computer education toys.
He's back, (Hasbro/Playskool, <0x24>40, for children from 3 years of age), with a bag full of quiz cards designed to make driving fun with a self-service, funny workbook.
If you are sending a smartphone for your child, here are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo (<0x24>60, for children from 3 to 8 years old) is the cheapest version with easy-to-use, qwerty keyboard, although the games do not have as effective instruction as Leapster Explorer (<0x24>70, for children from 3 to 12 years old), the first significant change in the series with Leapster, and Leapmf.
No versions are compatible with older units.
The iXL from Fisher-Price (<0x24>90, for children from 3 to 7 years old) uses iTunes-like to launch games and e-books and has an SD card slot that allows you to view family photos.
And finally, the Scrabble Flash (<0x24>30, Hasbro, for children from 8 years old) is a set of five cubes that are not larger than a box of flashlights, each of which has an LED display.
The goal is to create words by placing the cubes in the row before the time runs out; it’s great for competing in improvised word creation.
More and more toys have at least some kind of online connection.
To the most extent, two Webkinz and Club Penguin toys were represented in the toy shops.
If you want to buy your child an online toy from Club Penguin, you can choose, for example, Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, <0x24>5, for children from 6 to 12 years old), which contains hidden code coins.
When you activate the code online, your child will receive enough credits in the Club Penguin store for any two items.
This could include, for example, a wheel scooter or an animal Puffle.
A little bigger than the brush of your toothbrush is the Hexbug Nano (<0x24>10, for children from 5 years), the latest in a range of micro-robots per button battery.
The brooch moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in random direction.
It’s fun to make a mess out of your bones and watch if he can find a way out.
It is also very resistant.
Ours was able to fall off the kitchen table and even spend some time in the palm of our dog.
Increased police checks in China
As a city military instructor, Tang Shenbin walked through the square, strictly inspected his orders, and issued orders semi-sponsoredly with military authority.
He wanted the female members – Chinese state-run urban lawmakers, feared and disdained for their harsh actions and pretense of violence – to convey a certain impression of the surroundings.
"Get up straight!"
"Hurry up!"
Show them, whispering in silence, "How beautiful girls look!"
Four very young girls in white gloves and the same olive coats and pants stood out.
Four pairs of black boots are sorted according to the rule.
The four head covers fit perfectly on the hair, which are perfectly tied with blue and white stripes.
"Personally, I think they look average," said Mr. Tang reluctantly.
"Models are nice."
More than one government has been trying to revive the image of city overseers in China.
One city ordered the new pupils to have a higher education.
Guangdong Province has changed grey-green uniforms to allegedly more attractive blue.
In central China, Wuhan replaced the blinded eyes with strong weapons: in 2009, it was reported that 50 officers surrounded the wagon with snails and looked straight at the owner as the smuggler slipped for half an hour.
Xindu, a city district with 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, chose the operation as the main picture.
Since 2003, the district has supplemented its urban police with 13 women who have been selected specifically according to their appearance, proportionality and young age.
The aim is to show, in addition to the rough side of the police, also a more subtle, female side.
Unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson herself would have trouble getting into secret Chinese city groups.
Critics would argue for a good reason.
Unlike the police, these police officers are only allowed to promote the city decree, impose fines and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media usually captures a different reality.
In January 2008, police inspectors from Hubei province beat a non-participating spectator to death after using his mobile phone to shoot as they began a protest against the debris.
Last year, police training took place in Beijing, the manual for this training was stolen and placed on the Internet. In the manual was, among other things, a description of how to effectively beat the perpetrator without blood marks.
This year, a melon merchant in Shanghai got into a fight with five policemen and suffered a left-brain injury.
A video game full of violence that can be downloaded online shows Chinese police attacking street vendors.
"Chengguan frightened the government," China Daily, a national edition, complained last year after further discussions about tactics.
There was a "very thorough cleaning" on the paper.
Skeptics say such an approach is not enough.
After the district advertised interest in eight new women police officers in October, The Beijing Evening News co-founder addressed the question of whether women have real responsibilities or are just distractions.
The answer seems to be from both.
The period required female candidates aged 18 to 22 with a good figure and "five face features in the right proportion."
Adepts should have a height greater than the diameter - that is, more than 1.6 meters.
The service at age 26 is mandatory.
Officials claim that work is mentally too demanding for women over the age of 25.
"Their image is an important thing," an unnamed police officer on Rednet.com said, as if it were government websites.
"Candidates must first demonstrate external qualities, which then determine others, including height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes a series of characters and "internal quality".
Women are like flower vases, he said, adding, "In addition to being vases, they will also have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the District City, strongly disagrees with this description.
But he pointed out that high-level requirements are also common in China for other jobs, for both sexes.
As well as the requirement for proportional facial features.
This means that the issue of good standing is a subject of discussion among the Chinese.
Healthcare disability or freezing will certainly not apply.
"He can't allow a chrome or backed man to serve with us," Mr. Zheng said.
"His image would not be good."
Liu Yi, who holds a guard on Baoguang Square near the monastery, is 22 years old, faced like an apple and gently shaped mouth.
She does not think that the emphasis on her appearance could have a sexist impact, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with an ironic look.
Her co-worker with dolls, 21-year-old Xu Yang, says, "Our job is to represent the image of the city."
They have no objections to their limited performance, they said, because their career ambitions are greater than just launching traders into the streets where they can carry out their business.
Every morning, the group stands up against more than ten marketers who run on foot or on wheels and try to sell as many toasts and tofu bowls as possible before they are avoided.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave."
"We've told you so many times!" said Miss Xu, as the marketer began to run away, and for a while he left his bike with a trolley with noodles.
Police describe their duties as more monotonous than strenuous.
“Every day is essentially the same,” said Huang Jing, 20, who is studying in her free marketing.
"A great routine."
One reason is that female police officers do not have the same powers as their male counterparts so that merchants can seize the goods.
They can only threaten to report the facts to their male leaders.
The tendency is then to protect them from sudden public manifestations of hostility against the official apparatus, which are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, rebelled after fake news spread that police killed dealers.
More than ten police officers or police officers were injured at night; 14 government vehicles were overturned or incinerated.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But peace can only be guaranteed rarely.
Just two blocks from the quiet Baoguang Square, where police officers were guarded that morning, more than 50 people gathered at the corner of the street.
Police seized a motorcycle, which was repaired on the pedestrian instead of inside the store, as required by the regulations.
The driver could cry as much as he wanted.
15 minutes away from the police, faced with anger, with elbows against vehicles and quickly away with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, the coordinator assigned to the male group, stayed behind, his white badge turned to hide his name.
Like female police officers, coordinators are men over the age of 40, who already have only an auxiliary role.
Unlike them, they are not trained in the maintenance and glazing of the image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," said Mr. Li stuffy.
“It’s usually the public that starts with it.”
Prosecutors will not blame Senator Ensign
Attorneys at the Justice Department have cleared Senator John Ensign of criminal charges related to his affair with a former campaign adviser and his attempts to secure the lobby, lawmakers told the Senator on Wednesday.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, a Nevada Republican, who was, until the scandal, considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012. His affair got into national titles and damaged his career.
Mr Ensign’s office said he was “very pleased” with the decision that followed almost a year’s investigation.
The senator could still face disciplinary proceedings at the Senate Ethics Commission.
Mr Ensign's lawyers said the Justice Department "informed us that Senator Ensign will no longer be the target of the investigation and that he is not planning to make further charges against him in this matter."
The Ministry of Justice has refused to comment on the case.
The decision was a surprise to many ethical lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice, who claimed that there was serious evidence that Mr Ensign was preparing a violation of the federal lobbying ban.
Interviews, emails, and other documents published in the New York Times in October 2009 said Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, secure a lucrative lobby that was meant to silence Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about Cynthia.
Mrs. Hampton used to work as a cashier in Ensign's campaign.
Mr Ensign has contacted a number of political supporters to find work for Mr Hampton and to support their views after Mr Hampton was hired to lobby for them, as much as documents and interviews show.
Since Hampton was recently Mr. Ensign's assistant, he was excluded from the lobbying law of his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethics experts claim that the unusual handling of Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were friends before the affair, appeared contrary to the ban on lobbying.
From the evidence that has been released "it has been revealed that this is a clear case of preparing for a violation," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer specializing in the defense of clients who are being investigated by the government.
While the officials of the Ministry of Justice refused to explain the reasons for the decision in the case of Senator Ensign, Mr. Brand and other lawyers specializing in ethics said that the ministry is cautious with regard to political complaints, after a large number of failures, after a large number of failures.
Federal prosecutors “clearly hid their weapons,” said Melanie Sloan, executive director of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a lawyer group that filed several complaints against Mr Ensign in the case.
"This basically indicates that the laws do not apply to high-ranking government officials," she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr Ensign's chief lawyer, said in an interview that he was called by the Justice Department's attorney general on Monday and then on the second day, telling him that the ministry was not seeking any charges against his client.
Mr Ensign's defense team is working with the prosecutor in an effort to convince him that the senator, as his office reiterated in the statement on Wednesday, "has acted in accordance with the law."
Mr Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he had made to the prosecutors.
"It's not nice to show the details of my discussions with the Justice Department except that we think they've made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to stop investigating a separate complaint, in which the ethics group accuses Ensign’s parents’ payment to the Hamptons of <0x24>96,000 violated the federal electoral law.
The Electoral Commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that money meant nothing but a gift.
One company for which Mr Ensign helped Mr Hampton find a lobbyist job was NV Energy, the main Nevadan company that had long supported the senator.
An email from December 2008 showed that after Mr. Hampton began acting as a lobbyist in the company, Ensign's chief of staff - John Lopez - had communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that he had "broken" to the Interior Ministry about the subject under discussion.
Mr Ensign also attended lunch with Mr Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and called on the Minister of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after Mr Hampton was hired for lobbying.
When an affair report first appeared last year, Mr Ensign apologized to his voters and resigned as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After months of stagnation, Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he planned to take part in a third term in the Senate.
In a report that Mr. Ensign is no longer the target of investigating the crime, his spokeswoman Jennifer Cooper said the senator hopes that the ethics commission will soon follow up with the Justice Department and end the entire investigation.
"Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing her hard work on behalf of the Nevada people," she said.
Cheshire Challenge Turns to Twitter
Half a dozen of them were written in rows of courtrooms.
Minute after minute, they sent messages of a terrible testimony via Twitter.
Lastly, the defendant says more than 140,000 tweets were dealing with rape and attaching children to beds in the house that was burned.
On Thursday, the trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of killing three Cheshire citizens, Connecticut, families, was scheduled to take place, and an official cessation of the death penalty, for which the jury voted.
But Mr Hayes’ lawyers have already appealed to the court with applications and arguments that the court is likely to employ for years.
One of the most provocative is that intensive reporting on the process - including the widespread use of Twitter by major reporters - created a "circus atmosphere" and this expanded, immediate penetration of information with instigating details then introduced the jury's decision-making in-depth.
This claim could force the judge to address the question of whether, with the advent of new technologies, new rules in the courtroom should also be required.
“As I have experienced in this trial, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technologies in the courtroom affects the rights of a fair trial for individuals,” said Thomas J. Ullmann, Chief Advocate of Mr Hayes.
Judge Jon C. Blue of the trial of the state Supreme Court briefly rejected allegations regarding last week’s earnings and that the media were “strictly checked” and that there was no evidence to suggest that the jury was under the jury’s control.
But this is probably not the last word in this case.
For decades, the courts have recognized that reporting notorious cases can raise questions about the justice of the trial.
In a 1966 court order, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of Cleveland chiropractor, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, when in his decision he said that in the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell, he was "disappointed" in the trial for media reasons.
Some are convinced that this crime was the inspiration for a TV show and the film "The Refugee".
Some lawyers said that the appellate courts, which reviewed Hayes’ judgment half a century later, might be surprised by the argument that new rules could be necessary to determine the way of communication from the courts, which was in Dr. Sheppard’s case.
"There is a general reason to worry about the impact of new media" in highly monitored cases, said John J. Donohue III, a professor of law at Stanford Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report saying it was executed at any time.
Professor Donohue said that some judges may be fascinated by the idea that restricting direct communication from courtrooms could make the process more fair.
The Twitter case is just one of Mr Hayes’ many drawn lawyers who would be able to argue for years to hold the sentence.
Advocates also claim that in the case of Mr. Hayes, it may be a prejudice that Judge Blue refused to allow him to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them criminal images of terror when selecting a jury.
Some of the juries said they were frightened by the photographs of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughter Hayley, 17, and Michael, 11.
Prosecutors claim that they also reject the constitutionality of the death penalty and claim that the judge wrongly dismissed the jury, which was critical of the state prosecutors, and that by his decision he put more pressure on the verdict and directed the jury to spend the weekend.
The judges were not separated.
But their arguments about the impact of the scale of the process can attract the greatest interest.
They said in opposition to the verdict last month that the case dominated reports in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign of candidates for governor and the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the media was constantly stirring up the flames of emotion in the case of this case.
"The daily press, cameras and reporters before the court," wrote the lawyer, "was something that has not been seen here in New Haven, and it may also be a state-wide rarity."
Their focus on Twitter’s actions is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists argued that the immediate reporting was more inspiring than the reports mentioned later, and in their view, the judicial police should manage the scope of further proceedings.
But some lawyers have demanded appeal courts with frequently used arguments that social and technological changes require court adaptation.
Mr Hayes' lawyers are working for this right.
In their archives, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court decision in Dr. Sheppard’s judgment, due to the broad scope of the process, and wanted to clarify the requirement that the new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "is the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can courtesy overcome failure?
After the campaign, which was remarkable for its outrage and negativity, a small amount of courtesy appeared this week in Washington.
Is this the first step in real cooperation between the two political parties or just an illusory moment before a quick return to the party fight in the capital?
On Tuesday, President Obama’s and parliamentary leaders’ talks brought no major findings on the key issues that must be discussed during the meeting.
In any case, however, it was a courteous discussion about the differences of opinion between the two parties, as well as the definition of their shared responsibilities, rather than another empty episode of party restraint.
The president's public meeting on Wednesday's deficit committee was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that close co-operation for several months has built up mutual respect that goes beyond the ideological breakdown that members still share.
And it is quite difficult to say that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in a trial period – probing each other for signs of collegiality and compromise, while trying to assess the boundaries of public opinion and electoral patience towards a renewed party war.
Therefore, Tuesday's hearing and its subsequent assessment of the participants were also carried out with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too broad and too deep to propose a rapid change in the ratios that have prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it’s taxes, spending, health care or rights, both sides are miles away.
However, the November elections were prepared by Washington at least quickly.
“It’s not a question of whether regulatory issues have changed,” said Pete Wehner, Bush’s administrator, now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
“They are inevitable after the election.
Elections evoked the party's emotions and then they hung up.
It's good."
In a few issues, especially those that are to be discussed at the meeting, Republicans and Democrats have little chance of finding a solution.
Bush’s tax cuts expired at the end of the year and no one considers it favorable.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or all, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, the likely compromise on unemployment benefits is only because Republicans cannot look at how they support tax cuts for property, while the unemployed refuse unemployment benefits.
After Tuesday's meeting in the White House, there is already more optimism about a possible agreement on these issues, along with the ratification of the new launching treaty.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution cautions that successful cooperation on key issues will not necessarily lead to two political parties’ relationships when the 112nd Congress is convened in January.
Rather, it is a likely period of disagreement, or even inevitable, he said.
"After things are done that have to be done, psychology will return to one of the confrontations in the short term," he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism - which is greatly expanded - that courtesy will lead to real cooperation.
"I look at all the events between now and 2012 as a shadow box, when the main events will take place in 2012," he said.
The reasons are largely related to the formation of a new Republican majority in the White House and the tea party voters who helped create it.
Republican leaders now face the threat of extortion, they know they must act according to their promises, and they must cut government spending and repeal the new health care law.
These alignment lines are clear in the initial responses to the deficit recommendations, which include reforming the tax code and increasing certain taxes, increasing the retirement age and reducing spending.
Joint Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, in their opinion, have to develop the pressure of deficit issues to the public program in ways that cannot be ignored.
They only need 14 votes in the 18th committee to present their plan as an official recommendation and therefore to fight to get as close to this number as possible.
The biggest opposition is among elected jury officials, who suggest that in the case of financial issues, we have at least today, small grounds or a willingness to compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the White House and parliamentary Republicans.
The first will begin next year in the form of party conflicts, when Republicans will call on Obama to resolve the budget, taxes and health care, when a period of greater party cooperation will follow.
What causes the shift?
The public opinion.
There’s a lot of evidence that despite the sidelines in recent elections, most Americans still want to see the two sides working together.
If it could go to the pit, as it was in 1995, then both sides will be very closely watching the reactions of the public.
Anyone who threatens to cut votes will likely change course and look for a compromise.
It can be an optimistic view of things.
Partisanity and alignment are greater today than it was in the mid-1990s and it turns out that there is a greater ideological divide between Obama and parliamentary Republicans than it was in the case of Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, activists on both sides see 2010 as a prelude to more important elections in 2012.
Based on this reality, the courtesy that emerged this week would welcome many Americans.
But it will take a lot of effort on both sides to find common grounds on issues that still divide them.
U.S. document describes Moscow as a refuge for corruption
The city’s management is in the hands of “cleptocracy” and it continues part of the fees and protection fees coming along the way to the Kremlin, the US embassy in Russia said in February.
Police and the Federal Security Service have largely held protective wings, which help explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legal stores but also from organized criminal groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy – which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called “the vertices of the office” – will take its own when the money starts to move up the ladder.
The record, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted via WikiLeaks on their website on Wednesday.
The record is based on the sources whose names have been edited.
The record was written at a time when Yuri Luzhkov was still the mayor and accused her of a large share of corruption.
He was resigned in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but since then we can only see minimal changes in cleanliness.
Luzhkov and his wife Yelena Baturina, who owns a prominent construction firm, have for many years consistently denied allegations of corruption, and won several prosecutions for false accusations of such allegations.
In September, he told a Russian television station when he was questioned on evidence of corruption: "It's crazy, it's dirt, it's dirt."
Russians with absolute conviction believe that if their society is corrupted, it will turn out to be voting.
However, it is unusual to meet with such details expressed in such a way, in the embassy report, and it is also unheard of by diplomats from foreign countries.
“Moscow’s government and its association with criminals have led some to call it ‘dysfunctional,’ and confirm that the government operates more as a kleptocracy than as a government,” the report said.
"Criminal elements enjoy the so-called 'krysha' (a term from the world of crime and mafia, literally meaning 'roof' or protection) provided to them by the police, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior and the Office of the Attorney General of the City, as well as in every state.
"Analysts have also identified the three-stage structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The Federal Security Service, the Ministry of the Interior and the militia are on the second level."
"And finally, at the lowest level, there are ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors."
“It is an inefficient system in which criminal groups fill vacancies in some areas because the city does not provide some services.”
The report says the FSB takes money from the biggest companies and the police focuses on small businesses.
One source said, "The owners of the Moscow stores realize that it is better to get protection from the FSB or the Ministry of the Interior (rather than from organized criminal groups) because they not only have more weapons, resources and strength than criminal groups, but they are also protected by the law."
"For this reason, protection from criminal gangs is no longer so in the course."
The record says that while the choice of money is complex, protection itself can already have trouble; even those that apply can sometimes be arrested.
For those who don’t pay fast enough, their trades are closed under different premises.
Medvedev spoke several times about the fight against corruption, but admitted that he had only made little progress.
The embassy report talks about men taking suitcases, probably in a rush of cash, to the Kremlin itself.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of the Moscow research team Inde in a recent interview.
“It’s part of this bureaucracy.”
“It is not part of a political class because there are no political classes in Russia anymore.”
Without politicians, without opposition, without division of power, corruption is inevitable, he said.
Indem estimates that Russia’s corruption costs more than <0x24>300 billion a year nationally.
The country ranks 154th in a recent survey on the global perception of corruption by the NGO Transparency International (the countries are ranked from the least to the most corrupt).
The disclosure of the U.S. embassy's report, which appeared in Moscow only late in the evening, certainly did not excite the Russian government, although only to the extent that the Moscow shortcomings could be blamed for Luzhkov, it could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue in the matter.
In an interview with CNN’s Larry King, Putin said the documents published by WikiLeaks could be fake and reacted furiously to a statement that U.S. diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
“The truth about the whole matter is that it is our mutual interaction, which is an important factor of domestic policy in this country,” he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't think it would be done with such arrogance, with such pressure, you see, so unethical."
Veterans of the Khmer Rouge are forced to deal with the past
In the backdrop of the illuminated concrete classroom with studded and pencil walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School reminded the man who built it, the leader of the Red Khmer Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Moka."
"He was a good leader and took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as a "cutter" for his brutality during the Khmer Rouge government, he remains the commander in this remote Khmer Rouge country in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Khmers surrendered to the government, long-standing loyalty is also being drilled in Anlong Veng.
In April, the victims of the Truth Forum and Reconciliation were allowed to publicly confront people who were part of the regime.
In June, the government provided textbooks that explain for the first time to children the history of the Red Khmers and their former soldiers.
And in July, the United Nations and the Cambodian Court jointly bring the first sentence of a former member of the Red Khmer, the verdict of a former leader, notoriously known violent association Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, known as the Spirit.
With each such progress, there has been a growing turmoil among the veterans of the Red Khmer in Anlong Veng, which complicates efforts to reconcile and their attempts to re-engage in Cambodian society.
“Among the former Red Khmers there is fear and fear, but they are powerless to do anything,” said Chhang Youk, head of Cambodia’s documentation center, an independent organization investigating the regime.
"For them, life among the Red Khmers was wonderful, but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"It divides families."
During the Khmer Rouge government in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of starvation, disease or overwork.
When the Vietnamese attacked and overthrown the Pol Pot government in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its troops fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they began the uprising, which lasted until the last movement in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary waged partisan wars from their bases in the mountains and jungles in western Cambodia, while Ta Mok cultivated supporters in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace deal, the country was led to the first democratic elections in 1993. Large groups of Red Khmer fighters began to move to the government, which culminated in the capitulation of Ieng Sara in 1996 and Nuon Chea in 1998 and Samphan in Khieu.
Pol Pot died of natural death in 1998 and Ta Mok, who survived, was captured in 1999 by government forces in the nearby mountains of Dangrek.
He died in Phnom Penh Prison in 2006 while waiting for trial.
Their mecenas no longer cared for them, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters fell into the ordinary Cambodian rural life and many of them nostalgically reminiscent of the time of the movement.
Although several elite Red Khmers retained their local government position in exchange for their weapons, their position remains weak as unqualified farmers.
"These people had only a minimal benefit from capitulation," said Sok Leang of the Justice and Reconciliation Center, which is headed by public forums across Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are surrounded by a utopian agrarian ideology."
"They were raised without any idea of conducting a trade."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Red Khmers as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before establishing himself as a poor farmer in 1998.
"Life under the Red Khmer was good," he said.
"That Mok enjoyed them all."
“But now life is hard, because we have to make sure of everything ourselves.”
The ongoing court of the Red Khmers also raised concerns.
At the beginning of next year, the court will begin investigating Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Red Khmer minister.
The court has a mandate to prosecute the chief translator and the people responsible for the crimes, but it has not been said whether it will continue in the four cases.
It was little to calm the worries in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation focused on Im Chaema, 64, who was the district leader in the province of Banteay Meanchey during the Khmer Rouge government in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Documentation Center in Cambodia that she was overseeing the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project that likely killed thousands of forced workers.
On a recent steamy evening, Im Chae returned from work on the field to her wooden house on a dirty road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to set and shadows appeared across the empty grass, Im Chae refused to talk about her past among the Red Khmers.
If the court had summoned her, she would have refused to go.
"There is peace in Cambodia and it is stable," she said.
"If there is another criminal prosecution, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who passed from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there will be instability if the court seeks further suspects, although experts and historians disagree.
"Cambodia must dig a deep hole and bury the past in it," he said.
But confrontation with the past is just what Cambodia has to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk from the documentation center.
"Reconciliation in Khmer relations means blinding broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand each other."
The Centre has published the first Red Khmer government-approved textbook, with 75 pages and the title "History of Democratic Cambodia."
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as an addendum to the history textbook of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the Red Khmers.
Like many people in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Vengu knew little about the Red Khmer, despite the city's connection with the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a high school student in Anlong Veng said the new textbook helps students understand important parts of their history.
But his parents were skeptical when he took the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the courts," he said.
"They're suspicious because they're not sure how many people will be prosecuted."
Such resistance makes the process of reconciliation more complicated and more difficult, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, textbooks and the court are beginning to have an impact, he said.
The Red Khmer still has a strong charm.
Up in the Dangrik Mountains is a road engulfed in grass and spilled out of discarded plastic bags, which leads to a rectangle of black scissors covered with a carved sheet roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned on a pile of tyres after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a mobile phone vendor on the side of the road, said she didn't know much about the man who was buried there.
"But he has a strong spirit, many locals here are walking and praying to him," she said.
Nuom Sothea had a birthday and planned to later visit the resting place of Pol Pot, where she will bring a bunch of ripe bananas in the hope that it will bring her luck.
Belarus agrees that it appears its stockpiles of uranium-based weapons
In a surprise victory in President Obama’s campaign to secure nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that it would give up its stockpiles of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The agreement was published in a joint statement issued after the Hillary Rodham Clinton Foreign Minister and Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martyn's Security Summit.
For years, the U.S. government has been trying to persuade Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium, and it seems that they hit the rock last spring.
But U.S. officials told The Washington Post that in the past two months, a couple of covert operations have been carried out with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of uranium-based weapons from the Belarusian research facility.
This prepared the ground for Wednesday's deal to remove the rest of the material - about <0xC2><0xA3>500, according to an official who spoke on condition of anonymity, because this is a sensitive matter.
The agreement proved to be one of the most important results of Obama’s 47th National Nuclear Security Summit in April, at which Belarus was excluded.
And it was probably a good move to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
“I was really fascinated by the fact that they want a place for the 2012 nuclear security summit.”
“This proves the process is working,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a group supporting nuclear security.
Clinton called the deal a "very significant, important step" from Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 that he would secure all sensitive nuclear materials around the world within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their stockpiles of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
Dozens of countries have done so for George W. Bush’s administration.
At the Obama Summit on Nuclear Security, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko announced that his people would never give up their uranium.
"We have highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially the basis for a weapon and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said.
“It’s our commodity... We’re not going to make dirty bombs and we’re not going to sell them to anyone.”
"We only use it for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus, however, joined the United States a few months ago and expressed an interest in reaching an agreement.
The first commitment to remove Belarusian uranium in October was particularly complicated, as the material was lightly exposed, officials said.
It was loaded on a special train that travelled more than 1,300 miles to Russia's storage and disposal facility, officials said.
The second operation was closed on Monday and was carried out by air, officials said.
The U.S. government has spent <0x24>13 million on the program, most of it for delivering less enriched uranium to the Belarusian research institute, which is not suitable for the production of nuclear weapons.
“Everything was coordinated very carefully and managed on the basis of trust,” which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an official at the Energy Ministry working for Global Threat Reduction.
The James Martin Center for the study on nuclear non-proliferation this year estimated that Belarus has at least 88 pounds of uranium used in the production of weapons.
Belarus will, according to a joint statement, try to remove its stocks by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, mainly because of Lukashenko’s cruel repression of human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggests the possibility of gradual melting.
"We welcome progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognized that a more consistent observance of democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the basis for improving mutual relations, and it is necessary for the progress of the country and its population," he said.
The Spanish government did not do CIA jewelry flights
The Spanish government did not make any jewelry about the CIA flights of the Taliban and Al-Qaeda members to Guantánamo via Spanish territory, a U.S. envoy in Madrid said in a telegram.
This is due to documents provided by the WikiLeaks server in El País, where it is also written that the then first deputy Prime Minister María Teresa Fernández de la Vega asked for the Spanish executive to be informed and "might thus be able to show that he has a proper oversight of the situation."
In June 2006, following a communication from the Council of Europe in which dozens of countries, including Spain, were accused of participating in human rights violations, a meeting was held between U.S. Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The deputy prime minister said the Council of Europe's communication "excluded Zapatero's government from the game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
De la Vega stressed that Spain does not have a problem with flights of secret services across its territory.
"They simply want to be informed" so that they are not "unprepared," Aguirre said in one of the documents.
The then foreign minister, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel Moratinos, also told the U.S. ambassador that the Spanish government "wants to give the lowest possible outline of the matter, but that the matter was in the hands of the judges, the cabinet had a limited possibility".
In February 2007, Prosecutor Vicente González told the Embassy that, as far as he is concerned, he does not intend to block the initiative of the judge to request the disclosure of the documents of the National Center for Secret Services (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence relating to CIA flights.
"This information does not contain any criminal records or any sensitive information," the Embassy said after an interview with the prosecutor.
However, the U.S. has expressed concerns more about "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" than about the disclosure of information by the CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
“This coordination between independent experts will complicate our efforts to solve this case discreetly among governments,” Aguirre said.
In March 2007, on the occasion of the lunch of the U.S. Ambassador and Interior Minister Alfred Pérez Rubalcaby, he told the ambassador that "although the Spanish judges are very jealous of their independence and they will make the mind of the mind of the mind with the mind of the mind of the mind, the mind of the mind of the mind, the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind."
The Ambassador also expresses his concerns about the political party's (PP; Czech People's Party) meeting on this issue.
“Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience tells us that the Popular Party will not hesitate to take advantage of any indications that the Zapatero government has tolerated or deliberately ignored the actions of the United States, which could be interpreted as a possible violation of human rights,” he said.
Admitted mother-murderer complained on the net about maternal "age"
A young woman was talking about a child when she was already dead, and had her blog: "Terror in Galicia"
Mónica Juanate Fernández calls herself "Muki" on the Internet.
with this surname she had already used, she communicated with her cousin and at least one friend; the two are from the village of Noia in the area of La Coruña, from which the young woman comes.
The reports are from 2008.
To understand them, it is necessary to know the emotional life of the woman, which the ABC diary reconstructs with the help of the testimony of her family members.
A 30-year-old woman from Galicia entered a relationship with industrialist Iván Tunez in 1998.
They've been together for a year.
Shortly after the divorce, she found out she was pregnant.
The husband wanted to know if it was his newborn baby, but his ex-girlfriend never let him do DNA tests.
She soon found a new acquaintance.
Her chosen was Alberto, a young man from the nearby town of Lousame.
Their coexistence lasted a long time.
Little Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to look for a job, the little boy stayed with her partner, who even came to visit her in Palmy for a week.
However, from the content of her communication, it is apparent that the relationship broke down.
In March 2008, she was on her own in Menorca and wrote, "Alberto is kind of angry that I left for work."
"When I told him, it seemed good to him, but now he realizes that he has to be with a little all day and he can't do what he wants."
Then she talks about the text message she just received: "I want you to come back this month or give me the address where I should send you a baby."
He complains, “If he doesn’t like me to leave the little one with my mother, I’ll marry him when I get back,” he says.
In May, he said of his return to his home: “I’m going there this week, but I’m only going to stay until the 19th because I have to go to work on the 20th so that I don’t miss the place.”
He explains that if everything goes well, he'll take his son with him.
"She'll be with who she's supposed to be, so with me, and it's never going to happen in my life that I'd leave her with anyone other than my mother," he said.
There will be another post in July.
When she extracts this report, it is assumed that the child who arrived on the island on the first day of this month, and was probably murdered on the 10th, is already dead.
Caesar is content on the one hand, but he is not on the other.
“On the one hand, he’s with me and he likes it pretty much here, but on the other hand, he goes to school almost every day.”
He's talking about moving to Mallorca.
"He's going to go to summer school there, so I'm saving some money for a babysitter."
Seventeenth Greetings and Complaints.
"A big kiss from Caesar asking me when you're coming."
“Alberto says I don’t know what videos he sent you to email, look how he wants it, meets me, sex is needed.”
Thirty-one more message: "The boy is doing well, he's going to summer school to learn Catalan."
There's also a report about Víctor, the current partner: "He's giving me money."
On the internet there are Monica's posts on anime and manze blogs.
She even had her own on MySpace, now revised, where she used to call herself "Muki ex-prisoner".
"Terror in Galician (motto)".
The last man she lived with, the guardian, expresses her regret and feels guilty.
She doesn't want to believe that everything would happen because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Mónica entered a provincial prison in Palma yesterday, where she arrived from a prison in Menorca.
The defendant, Carlos Maceda, said the defendant "doesn't remember how everything happened and didn't intend to hurt the little one in any way."
Before, however, she confessed to drowning Caesar in a bathtub and putting his body in a trunk.
The defendant and the prosecutor are asking for a psychiatric examination.
People would gain 4 seats in the House and the PSC (Socialist Party of Catalonia) would lose 9 seats
With the results of November 28, the PP party could have a keynote address at the town halls in Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After a significant increase in the votes obtained and the number of experienced MEPs during the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP (People's Party of Catalonia) already has a given idea of the elections of general elections, regardless of whether or not they are single-minded, their views are so positive.
In 2008, the Catalan people won 610,473 votes in the general election, while in the 2006 autonomous elections this number was only 316.222.
Last Sunday, the PPC (Catalan People's Party) won 384,091 votes.
If this trend of improvement persisted, which was supported by the transfer of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the voters of the PP, analysts of this party calculated that if general elections were to be held, the PPC could have 12 MEPs in the House (since 25 MEPs) and the Union would have 9 MEPs (since 8 MEPs).
These calculations would confirm that Catalonia is of fundamental importance to the PP and the PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party).
According to this analysis of the people, the ERC (Left Republican Party of Catalonia) would lose one member - now it has 3 - while the ICV (Green Initiative for Catalonia - renewal) would still have one mandate, if any, one more.
However, according to the electoral calendar, the closest delivery event will be held in May 2011 on the occasion of the municipal elections, where people could also have a decisive influence on the end of the dominance of the socialists in the four main provincial cities - the most important of 2011 - the administrative year of the Council of Barcelona is the 6 millionth of the year.
Both the nationalists and the people agree that the PSC could lose the town halls in Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists would not receive a majority and could not turn to their traditional allies, the ERC and the ICV.
Given the Republican debate, it would not be impossible for this party to lose its representation in the Barcelona representative office - since it is necessary to get at least 5% of the votes.
The PP has increased the number of votes received in the four capitals and could have a decisive impact in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they could play a major role in the coup in Tarragona, where they ruled together with the PP party before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP received only 500 more votes than the PSC, whose mayor Angel Ros has a very good relationship with Marian Rajoy – during the last campaign they met on several occasions.
The villagers have also won at other important town halls such as Badalona, Castelldeels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is represented in 34 municipalities in Catalonia and would like to form candidates in as many municipalities as possible.
Al-Qaeda Cell Provides Thousands of Passports
In addition to seven detainees in Barcelona, three others were detained in Thailand.
Seven Pakistanis and one Nigerian, who were detained by agents of the General Information Commission in Barcelona, formed a jihadist cell governed by Thailand, which set up passports for various groups of Al-Qaeda, including the authors of the "10" Al-Qaeda group, including the "10" of the authors of the "Tygmil" and the "Tygmil" group.
The Ministry of the Interior attaches great importance to the investigation of the matter, aiming to ensure with the help of "Operation Campaign" the weakening of the counterfeit Al-Qaeda apparatus at the international level and "thus limiting its operational capabilities".
Investigators estimate that during the two years that the cell was active in Catalonia, it could send thousands of passports to Thailand, where it was then faked and then delivered to groups that make up the criminal galaxy of another Al-Qaeda, to recapture the battlefields of the Earth and fight their wars.
This broken cell was not the only active jihad network in Europe, and therefore other European police units participated in these investigations, in addition to Thai services, and it cannot be ruled out that in the coming days, the battle will not be as bad as in other European countries.
In connection with this operation (when the Pakistanis were detained Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Thagunbiade), another development took place in Thailand, during which Atmadi and Zeharttjam were behind.
It was these men who ruled from Bangkok a cell based in Spain and others in other European countries.
The Catalan network, part of which was eliminated in 2009, stole tourist passports that met the demands of Islamists.
This means that the documents had to belong to men aged 25 to 45, had to be valid for several years and had no visas.
The investigative documents stress that no facts are yet known to link the detainees from Catalonia with the bombing in Bombay, although the author of these attacks, "Lashkar-e-Taiba", was to be one of the groups that received passports stolen in Falseland and in <0xC5><0xA0>pa.
It is worth mentioning, however, that a few days before the assassination, some <0x24>1,000 was sent from Catalonia by the transfer agency, which was "inserted" to buy tickets for mobile phones, which were later used by members of the "command" that killed 106 people.
The police have already seized a lot of evidence.
People's Party (PP) demands Mass to stop fiscal deal
The president of the PPC party (People's Party of Catalonia) Alicia Sánchez-Camachová yesterday had the opportunity to personally present to Arturo Masova her conditions, for which she is willing to support his appointment as president of the Generalitat; these conditions are consistent with the risks of her nationals, and the risks of their economics as proposed by their campaigns.
The president of the Catalan People's Party presented herself to a meeting with Artur Mass with the certainty of 18 MP seats received in the elections from last Sunday, which is more than satisfactory for gaining popularity, so the CiU candidate needs to hold at least one of its seats.
The possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliance, which the nationalists would like to hold in the House until the general elections are held, but the talks that he holds with the rest of the political leaders these days are carried in the Catalan spirit.
As for the president of the PP to get her support for the appointment, "she will have to end all the supreme and liberal speeches", as well as the economic agreement - similar to the one from Basque - about which the leader of the CiU wanted to leave even a voice in the referendum.
The two leaders would like to tighten the booming political apparatus of the autonomous government and reduce inheritance and donation taxes.
The details of the negotiations on Mass’s entry into office will be discussed within the PP Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquin Nadal (PSC), who promised a tough opposition, Joan Herrero (ICV) and today will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciudadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The director of the geriatric facility ensures that there were no deaths as a result of "lack of action"
Olot’s performances do not rule out that their caregiver killed more than 11 clients
The management of the geriatric center La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) yesterday gave a press conference to figure out what damage was caused to Joan Vily Dilmé's criminal behavior, the caregiver who, while employed there, killed at least eleven seniors he had in custody.
The director of this senior home, Joan Sala, accompanied by the facility's lawyer, Joana Canada's lawyer, announced that "the wish of the home of La Caritat would be to be able to bring charges against the culprit" responsible for the murder, however "legality and accountability of the prosecution."
In addition to the damage to the good name that this institution may suffer because it did not reveal the criminal activities of the caretaker in time, a major threat to the home of La Caritat are now claims for material compensation, which are already calculated by the legal representatives of the families of the survivors.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that his first crime was murdered in August 2009 and that he has not stopped killing since then.
The judge ordered the exhumation of the bodies of eight seniors at the home with the suspicion that in many cases no doctor had looked at the deceased in person, but that, due to the age and poor health of the patients, everything was handled over the phone.
La Caritat yesterday, through its director, resolutely rejected this extreme and stressed that "lack of action could not in any way be the cause of what happened".
Lawyer La Caritat added that "in the case there is no evidence that any third party other than the defendant would make a mistake."
The man, now nicknamed "The Angel of Death", admitted 11 murders yesterday and clarified that the first crime was committed on August 29, 2009, and a month and a half later killed the second elderly woman.
In this case, death was caused by too high doses of insulin, unlike the first time a soothing tablet was used.
Director La Caritat said it was difficult to control staff access to medicines.
Insulin and a cocktail sedative were probably in six of the nine cases that this caregiver used to kill patients in an effort to relieve them from suffering.
However, only the analyses that are now in the lab should show whether Vila is lying and actually looking for less cruel death for his first victims, or on the contrary, killing them by giving loot, as he already admitted in the case of three women killed between October 12 and 17.
in La Caritat they do not believe in medical claims, nor do they exclude that the number of killed may be higher than he has admitted, and justify their behavior in the various versions that Vila brought to the court with the knowledge that he must change his conduct when it became apparent that he had killed a man.
That is why they say they want justice to be available so that the entire scope of this matter is enlightened.
The European Central Bank threatens
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to the threat posed by the President of the European Central Bank, Trichet, who warned that “the markets should not underestimate our ability to react.”
The marginal differentials were closed by force and the shares of the European Bank fell by more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the ability of the European Central Bank to be mistaken - the euro has just risen above its critical value.
What happened yesterday is typical of the non-liquid market, which, although falling, is recovering - but thanks to its short and very speculative position.
It will take an investor a while to lose their fears.
A month ago, the European Central Bank quoted us to take back the liquidity rate today, and tomorrow it will have to revoke for the fourth time in two years.
The Bundesbank has called for the end of its inefficiency repayment plan and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures within the deadline and to leave unrestricted access for only one week.
Following the Irish crisis, we expect the liquidity rate to be predicted "at least by March" and to comply with a three-month auction with unlimited access by the end of this quarter, in order to guarantee liquidity at least by June.
We also hope that they will continue their bond purchase program and that they will even announce its intensification.
If it fails to meet the created expectations, it will thus re-create the reaction of yesterday’s markets, and if they continue blindly to lower the liquidity rate, God is with us!
The same thing happened at the congress in May, where they claimed they were not even thinking about buying bonds, and there was a collapse of the markets - tomorrow history could repeat itself.
The European Central Bank must be credible and resilient.
In May, it was announced by the pancakes on Monday and on Wednesday announced that it had already bought many, causing another market collapse.
Yesterday’s auction for one year in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro issued only 500 million with 5.28%, compared to 750 million with 4.81% of the previous auction.
Thus, the rates in Portugal fell by 30 points below, reflecting the change in the mood in the market, which occurred after the words of Trichet.
In Ireland, the figures represent the losses of Allied and Bank of Ireland.
Estimated amounts amount to about 10,000 million on short-term securities and another potential 15,000, they have a chance to become private capital by February, otherwise they will be de-established.
Although Ireland has no credibility after the problem was not detected by stress tests in July, the amounts are acceptable under the aid plan and will help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the government will need to get the approval of the new budget by Parliament and it still does not have enough support, so there is still uncertainty in Ireland.
Angela Merkel has softened the tone of her speech to unleash tensions in the face for the next EU summit on 14 December, which requires a political compromise to show that we are a Union and we are all on the same ship.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner, while others would prefer Beethoven’s Ode to the joy.
In Spain, the prime minister had the opportunity to present a plan of action, which will be approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous areas and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalisation, privatisation, measures to revive employment - in the ears of investors it sounds like the Four Years of Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and Zapatera explains why the Spanish stock exchange grew by 4.5%, that is, twice as much as the other European stock exchanges.
Unlike in February, the reactions of the government and the Spanish National Bank were quick and convincing - we are apparently benefiting from the effect of surprise.
Today we have a key three-year bond auction here, which will benefit from the Trichet effect, which, we hope, will result in a high demand that will help dispel doubts about our refinancing capability.
Applying for a rescue plan would be a self-sacrifice for Spain.
They would give us the cash we don't need - in El Tesoro there are 40,000 million in cash available, three times more than in March - further high rates and market access would be closed to us.
However, it is necessary to continue to use the strategy of Caesar's woman - "not only to be it, but also to appear it."
We can do it.
The president of the Eulen Group will attack the Vega Sicilia meeting requested by his children
The storm in the open conflict in the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family, the owners of Eulen and El Enebro, does not die.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, the group’s founder, attacks after calling it “totally meaningless”, El Enebro’s legal proceedings scheduled for the 16th of this month and demanded five of his seven descendants, to whom they should try to force the company’s help for their organs and the majority of the administration.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez and his sons Jesus David and María José set up a legal group for a new chapter in their dispute over the control of part of the company.
The founder of the largest corporate services holding company does not appear to be willing to challenge its membership dispute in the governing bodies of the El Enebro Group.
five of its seven descendants, who were appointed by the transferees during the shareholders’ meeting on 18 January of this year, were elected from its Administrative Committee and whose objection is entered in the Business Register.
The trial of El Enebro, scheduled for the sixteenth of this month, which was summoned by the official of the Commercial Court No. 2 in Madrid, has restored the bribery in the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family’s meadow.
Appeal to a judge is the only remedy until the dispute is resolved that guarantees the appeal of the Commission.
The last step of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilia, Marty and Elvira of the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez Mesquirizes considers David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez to be a "desperate means for his five children to serve by means of a court order and a clear legal deception to strengthen and improve the January 18 negotiations that would not be appropriate."
This argument will serve as a basis for justifying the legal assault of this act as "totally insignificant".
The discreetly silent protagonists themselves have already unsuccessfully tried to summon the court to a hearing in June.
In El Enebro, a group owned by Bodegas Vega Sicilia, the seven descendants of David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez control 100% of the capital.
However, the founder of the group, according to family protocols, demands the right to use 51% of capital.
This is a key issue that will have to be decided by the judge in the course of the hearing of the court proceedings, and the date of the hearing has not yet been fixed.
Red Bull triumphs in Formula 1 with secret weapons from Siemens
The software proposes real-time improvements in vehicles.
Since Red Bull entered the Formula 1 series in 2004, its history in this extraordinary world of speed has been characterized by surprise and success.
At first, no one took the chances of this newly coming team too seriously, and despite the uptrend of recent times, everyone was betting on the triumph of Ferrari Fernando Alonso.
Without reducing the riding abilities of the champion, German Sebastian Vettel, or the possibilities of the Renault engine that drives his car, a legend was born in the world of Formula 1 – a “secret weapon” that multinational Siemens has put in his hands to make Red Bull so successful.
In fact, it is a powerful simulation software that the German company launched in 2007 for the purpose of very remote motorsports.
The so-called PLM, this powerful software tool, was used to design assembly lines in production plants around the world, in power plants and for high-precision devices.
Its goal is to faithfully reproduce the product or simulate the process before it is actually created, thereby avoiding unnecessary mistakes and expenses.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan’s most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens’ industry division, explains that the use of this software enabled the Red Bull team to make “in a few hours, almost real-time” modifications and improvements that are otherwise detected during races and trials.
Russwurm says that in 1992, the staff employed an average of 10 technicians, who were able to perform up to three or four improvements in one period.
The Red Bull team is currently working on 180 young highly qualified professionals equipped with powerful information technology, analyzing and proposing each type of racing vehicle modification.
The CEO of Siemens explained that PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all elements of Red Bull’s racing vehicles, with the exception of the engine, for which Renault is fully responsible.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can be made from virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production systems using laser and highly technologically advanced autoclaves.
The only limit of this technical feasibility is the <0x24>40 million amount, the maximum that each Formula 1 team can spend for each period to improve its competitiveness.
Red Bull has set up a high-tech race, about 50 km from London, to design and manufacture its racing cars.
These are two buildings where the entrance is restricted to visitors - especially to journalists.
Everything that is happening here is considered a “great secret.”
The list of participants in this project is 580 people including two pilots - champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull in Formula 1 is undoubtedly fresh champion Sebastian Vettel.
However, behind the incalculable technological means that the brand of energy drinks has put in its participation in race circles, there are other protagonists, whose help is invaluable, and no one knows them.
Steve Nevey, head of manufacturing technology, says five years ago, it was possible to say that advances in vehicle research and development contributed to a 50% victory, and the rest was the drivers’ merit.
Currently, this ratio has changed and the technology is worth 85% success, while the pilots contribute 15%.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computing as they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP will set up its own 20 stores within two years in collaboration with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) in collaboration with its business partner Pont Reyes opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona yesterday.
The company will be the first of a network of 20 stores with an area of 80 to 100 m2, which this multinational company plans to open in Spain in the next two years.
These stores will also be located in 16 existing stores such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn or El Corte Inglés.
HP Vice President Helena Herrer has set the example of a newly rebuilt store at Barcelona’s Gran Vía, owned by Pont Reyes, with which HP has been working for 30 years.
The North American company has set up a plan to set up 200 stores in Europe by 2013, which includes 20 Spanish stores.
The first stores were opened last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia), so the store in Barcelona is third.
Herrer did not want to reveal where to open further stores, but admitted that Madrid could be one of the following locations.
Herrer, who also runs HP’s personal systems, has ensured that the business opening philosophy will remain the same – with the use of local distributors with industry experience and knowledge.
The North American company here deals with the exclusive design of store equipment (with products that can be interactively tested), which will be identical in Europe.
In addition, HP also deals with the provision of business personnel.
Helena Herrer denied that this would be a franchise, and stressed that the exclusive network of the store is aimed at “improving customer service, service to small and medium-sized enterprises in purchasing, service, after-sales service and even packaging.”
The store in Barcelona is part of a world-class pilot pioneering program that aims to solve any problems with computer devices in the guarantee.
The online service is connected to the technical center based in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"So we'll be able to solve problems within 10 minutes that may otherwise take up to two days."
"This system is specifically designed for small and medium-sized enterprises and for ordinary customers, since large companies already have contractual technical assistance service," Herrer said yesterday.
Sabadell bets on stealing a million customers from competitors within three years
More optimistic than other chief executives, Banco Sabadell’s delegate, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a challenging year for the bank, but rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
However, it is expected to reduce interest rates, which, however, will attempt to compensate by discounting bank fees and loan prices.
Sabadell expects to be able to acquire a million private clients within three years.
Sabadell found a way to take advantage of the next three years to survive in difficult economic conditions.
The Bank will launch a new three-year strategic plan in 2011.
The goal is, in addition to surviving without the need to turn to public assistance at FROB, to gain market share by capturing a million new private clients - and 700,000, respectively, if deducted by those who may leave the bank - since up to now the institution has more than a small and small client.
This year, the bank has already acquired 250,000 private clients and 50,000 businesses.
Its market share is 3.5% for private clients, while for corporate customers it is more than 10%.
Another key idea of the 2011-2013 plan is the commitment to productivity, or even to prudence, in order to reduce the costs the bank will face when it presents the results for the period.
Not many banking institutions have the courage to set and publish their goals at this time, as the financial crisis has changed all plans of world banking.
Sabadell will close its Optima programme this year, set four years ago, although it was originally for three years, but the market situation required an extension for a further period.
Customers who leave their savings will be their main target group.
At the APIE meeting, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be “hard and very important.”
In fact, he believes that the road out of the crisis in Spain "will be long."
In addition, it will be "very difficult to create jobs" in two or three years, which is fundamental to the survival of the banking sector, he added.
And while they believe that the passive war – which lowers margins – is slowing down, the price of the risk that banks and savers pay for their emissions to get liquidity is already shifting to credit prices, thereby compensating for the reduction in margins.
"The issue of liquidity and financing is structural and will be a pressure factor on loans."
"We haven't closed the scooter yet, but the differentials are very high," Guardiola said.
Banesto has already issued its network on Thursday orders to cut long-term loans and raise differential prices – see CincoDías of November 22-27.
He also acknowledged that the trend in banking "now is reducing commissions", but there is a "competitive framework".
Sabadell’s strategic plan is based on organic growth, however, as usual, the group does not exclude corporate operations.
It is not uncommon to ensure that in Spain "there will be a demand for larger sizes".
“Next year there will be no stone,” he said.
It confirms that capital needs are "decently reduced" and does not exclude that some Spanish institutions will enter the red numbers.
It also points out that FROB may be able to leverage funds on the market before a new capital measure.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive a temporary closure of markets, it remains a serious problem what some bankers predict as a new liquidity crisis.
It notes that it cannot be issued, but unlike what was in June, it is possible to receive short-term funding using repo rates, which mitigates the crisis.
CECA Excludes Another Wave of Fusion Savings
The Director-General of CECA yesterday declined that another wave of mergers should arise, and once again insisted on the speed with which sector reorganization is being carried out.
When he started the process of collecting Spanish savings, there were several institutions that ensured that the first phase would not be involved and awaiting the second round.
However, the Director General of the Spanish Confederation of Spartans (CECA) José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday ruled out that a new wave of these operations should be created.
"I believe that most of the mergers have already been carried out, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered a second round, what happens is conventions."
“The majority is completely implemented; it is possible that instead of 17 constitutions, we will go to 13 or 14, but all the major processes are already ready and under the protection of the Spanish National Bank, which has cooperated very well in this matter,” he said.
In his statements at the meeting of the ADEA (Association of Leaders and Executives of Aragon) Olavarrieta outlined that the process of concentration takes place "at the highest possible speed", and we must not be very satisfied with the success of the business, as it turns out in the past.
“Going from 45 savings firms with an average asset volume of 28,000 million to 17 with 75,500 million is a process that has no comparison in history, thus reducing the number of institutions by 62% to make them larger and thus falling in line with the Treaty of Basel,” he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of not too happy opinions on the slowness of the process" which show "a lack of seriousness and understanding" because "what the Spanish National Bank is doing is a reminder that we must be on deadline before the end of the year".
CECA Director General José Antonio Olavarrieta said yesterday that Spain has the most stringent financial system in Europe and "probably" in the world, and that those who question it have "lack of knowledge".
The director noted that in the current favourable economic situation, "we can be calm" with regard to financial institutions and a system that has managed a "very important" process of concentration and which continues "at the highest possible speed".
He also pointed out that Spanish banking came out very well from the stress tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and the Red German Line
Berlin has decided to keep the euro, but has set the conditions for the whole Union.
Tensions in the markets triggered a dual government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Zapatero proposed new adaptation measures, from tax reductions for small and medium-sized enterprises, to regulation of private mediation agencies or the cancellation of 426 euros for unemployed without a paycheck, to the privatization of the state of Prajas and 49% of the AENA fleet (Spanish airports and airports).
Vice-President Elena Salgadová, with the support of former Prime Minister Felipe González, on the other hand, has joined criticisms at Chancellor Angela Merkel's address because of her responsibility for triggering the current crisis.
How to interpret this movement?
It has already been said that Merkel’s position is not an error in her communication policy.
On the contrary, this is another point in the complex process of redefining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future is going to be, which comes down to the idea of adherence to old traditions, which is held by a large part of the other members.
Faced with European opposition, Germany is beginning to speculate on three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first is a strong euro zone, part of which would be Germany, but also, for example, Austria or the Netherlands, while the southern states would leave the currency zone.
The second is the return to March - although now it may seem like a scifi, this version has broad public support, approaching 50% of the population.
The third option, according to the German proposals, is to reform the euro with greater macroeconomic supervision, budgetary rigor, fines for guilty states, possible delays in payments for some of them, and with the extension of possible regulatory costs to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been defined for some time, so there is no room for sparks now.
First of all, when the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission pushed for deficits in 2009, the German government pulled out the constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of a contradiction between what Germany deemed correct (the fiscal tightening and the stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, practiced.
Secondly, these Central European countries showed when Merkel was painfully opposed to the decision to save Greece.
She was already the subject of sharp criticism at the time, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion, which was also published, were strongly opposed to Greece’s salvation.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel reappeared with a clear view when she called for reform of the European Union conventions so as to allow the rescue of a Member State and at the same time for private creditors to bear part of the costs.
This opinion was interpreted as anti-European, as it accelerated the Irish crisis and everything else.
However, its proposal, albeit somewhat mitigated, has been approved, and in the coming months we should follow the reform process of the Union, which should allow these measures from 2013 onwards.
Germany has outlined the red line, which it does not intend to cross.
And it tells us all that, although it is now necessary to take measures that seem to disagree too much, from this date the old functioning of the euro will be over.
The year 2013 will be the birth of a new monetary zone, in which states that violate the rules will be severely sanctioned and may be forced to report postponement of payments, and the private sector will also have to bear part of the costs.
Germany suggests that we must take a strict path of growth with increasing savings and investments, moderate consumption, improving productivity and competitiveness, and capital reserves.
Another option based on demands and building, with huge gaps in the balance of payments, which Spain ruled in the years of boom in growth, simply do not intend to tolerate.
The offer is clear.
And we'd make a mistake if we didn't understand it.
It is not just about restoring the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they want for us is much harder.
And the worst thing is that under these conditions, it could happen to us that we are mistaken.
I hope that these current turbulences will replace more peace.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities that they give us in the spring of 2013.
Prime Minister Zapatero seems to have understood this, too, and his double statement (the reforms promised after a meeting with big companies last Saturday and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggests that, through criticism of Merkel's address, the way has opened up to the idea that
However, the red line that Germany has outlined is here, and it does not seem to want to move with it.
And of the options that can be considered, leaving the euro area full of less serious countries cannot be excluded.
Well, Germany will always be able to tell us it warned us.
Sport and circumvention of rules
The finties presented by Alonso and Ramos in a match with Ajax show a reason not to avoid punishment.
The alleged exclusion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the Champions League match against Ajax on November 23 has resulted in an ink sketch about whether or not this is a non-sports behavior, and whether UEFA will not have both.
As is known, a few minutes before the end of the game (which their team had clearly won), the named players deliberately lost their time at the moment when the flaw was to be played to provoke the referee, and the player showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, both players will meet the penalty prescribed in the next match against Auxerre - where Real Madrid will end up in the front of their group - and will be able to continue to the next phase.
In the end, the UEFA disciplinary commission awarded coach José Mourinho a two-match penalty and the guilty players were fined.
Provocating a yellow card under similar conditions is not a new practice, but is more or less common in football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos of football, i.e. rules that are unwritten but are followed.
Part of the discussion in this case was due to the fact that its participant was the team of Real Madrid (who in his hymn boasts of nobility and honor, and who has already paid for similar acts to his players), and also, apparently, thanks to the dramatization of another media led by Mourinho and his epic comedy.
In any case, the debate is about whether this type of action, which is not explicitly prohibited by the rules, is contrary to the principles of sport, i.e. whether there is circumvention of the law in these acts; it is indeed an action that respects the rules of sport, which can be circumvented by the meaning of which
It resolves what type of damage such behavior affects the sporting spirit.
One of the attributes of athletic behavior is the physical inviolability of opponents, which was not violated in these cases, or there was no violent play.
Another of these features that characterize the pure game is to avoid the players from having an advantage over the opponent's team due to their violation - which is not the case here either.
So paradoxical to the Real Madrid player’s action is the fact that what we normally describe as a ladder or circumvention of the law, there was no hidden violation of the rules in order to avoid a penalty, but this behavior should be as visible as possible in order to receive the penalty.
They waited and liked to be punished.
The other question, however, is what advantage the culprits will have from their deliberate offense.
It should be noted here that the opponent does not get into a disadvantaged position, and that in the current game he does not seek any benefit, because the obvious consequence is that the team itself will have fewer players.
Nor is this a useful strategy for another game, as the club will not be able to count on these players.
The advantage is obviously that players start the next phase of the Champions League without cards, which could jeopardize their participation in a future game.
However, this is an advantage from a long-term perspective and with a certain degree of uncertainty, that is, at first glance the team can be eliminated, and in addition to this action, the players will be penalized, and they will go to the second round of cards, in which the exclusion is enough in the round of the penalty.
So as the wheels continue, it will not be entirely clear if this is an advantage.
In short, these actions are not against the sporting spirit, the part of which is to make a strategic decision that will allow to get the maximum benefit within the rules.
In the cases in which we are dealing here, the players were not aimed at avoiding the award of a penalty (which would be a clear circumvention of the rules), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without avoiding punishment or running away from it.
Although the boundary between the reasoning and the circumvention of the rules is not quite clear, I believe that in this case it was clearly a reasoning.
It seems to me that the controversy arises for two reasons: because these were two self-exclusions and because of the way in which instructions were transmitted to provoke them from the leadership.
Damage to sporting principles by these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Struggle offers for organizing Christmas parties in Barcelona
This year, the calendar’s dictatorship focuses the avalanche of reservations on December 16 and 17.
The celebration of paid by employees who want to spend between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 is rapidly increasing.
As with Turkish honey or lottery, with the arrival of December, Christmas parties are coming again, which still serves as an oxygen bomb for restaurants and leisure facilities in Barcelona, but thanks to the crisis, they have led to a struggle for getting customers, and they will be associated with a downward of 20 euros and a downward of 30 euros.
In order to complete the complication of the numbers, the calendar this year (when Christmas Day fell on Friday) concentrated on requests for a week from 13 December, creating a labyrinth of reservations for the days at the peak (16th and 17th), while in the previous week it did not stay for almost a week.
As has been the case since 2008, when the slim years began, there are many companies that have cancelled collective parties for budget reasons.
In order not to abandon the tradition, many employees pay for the expenses at parties from their own pockets.
Regardless of the situation, many are demanding prices on the fee limit, says the president of the restaurant association Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona, Gaieta Farras.
The representative of the patronage of restaurants at this time does not dare to predict what celebrations will be this month.
“People think about it before they make a reservation.”
“They want to come out, but when it comes to pricing, they are cautious,” he adds.
The stores will go well for those "who offer quality and good service at an affordable price", he says and reminds that thanks to the crisis, customers tend to go down a degree and most customers now want to spend around 25 euros.
A survey at various facilities shows that the biggest motivation for booking requests is on the evening of 17 December.
The Soteras Group reports a real boom in bookings for Friday, with the most demands being up to 30 euros, adjusting the offered currencies, whose total prices range from 25 to 30 euros.
In another major company, Andilana, with 16 facilities in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), has brought the peculiarity of this year’s calendar more early reservations since the beginning of November.
“We have made it possible and impossible to keep prices from last year, and our menus, each of which should be chosen, range from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>19.95 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30,” they said.
In the AN Grup group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 companies, they remain optimistic after seeing a growth in profits since the second half and have a relatively solid outlook for Christmas sales.
The company’s sources stress that December 18 will also be a busy day as the festive celebrations will be held among friends.
They added a Christmas menu to their six group menus, with a budget of 30 euros or more, as they recorded a tendency of guests to spend 10% more in exchange for other items such as cava (Spanish sparkling wine - cogn.).
They also noted that companies are already emerging, calling their employees again, and it seems that the size of the groups is somewhat larger.
Vice President of Fecasarm (which includes institutions such as Barcelona’s Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisure Centres) Enric Goma believes he is beginning to see the end of the tunnel and claims that the number of bookings has “revived” even though clients are “contracting to the maximum”.
This impression, even during Christmas celebrations, has not stopped, whoever pays, he points out.
Pakistan’s nuclear program has resulted in major unrest in the US
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons “at a faster rate than any other country.”
Wikileaks documents confirm ties between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. Department of State published by WikiLeaks confirms the extraordinary turmoil that sparks Pakistan’s nuclear program in Washington.
In addition to the clarifying and significant details that they offer about the content of the communication and the ideas of representatives of North American diplomacy in Islamabad, these documents reveal that cooperation between the two states is not about nuclear security, but about the state, rather than the state, rather than the state's "several," rather than the "several," rather than the "several," and the "several" of it.
The peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear program - that its weapons are not mounted, but stored in pieces to facilitate their destruction in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for Washington's vigilance.
This is calculated by Ambassador to Pakistan Anne W. Patterson in a report ahead of the visit of then National Security Adviser James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the territory under Taliban control, the alleged dissipation of nuclear warheads and the disruption of nuclear warheads."
The increased number of people associated with nuclear arsenals and the programme of controlled missiles is no longer seen not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as a widespread and presenting reason to be on the lookout.
“Pakistan had to hire staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; due to the decline in education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who will work in nuclear weapons programs or programs controlled by missiles,” said U.S. Secretary of State Yuri Korolov.
The biggest novelty of the documentation released by Julian Assange’s server is the ever-increasing lack of cooperation between the United States and Pakistan on the issues of the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the increased pace of Pakistan’s production of these weapons.
Depeche issued by the embassy in May, which qualifies communication with Pakistan as "frustrant", asserts: "Transparency often does not exist; aid offers remain unanswered or are rejected."
In another report, Peter Lavoy, a National Intelligence Service employee for South Asia, notes that "despite the economic disaster, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons as quickly as any other country in the world."
Ambassador Petterson also called on Washington to clarify during the visit of General Ashfaq Kayani, "very well" that "the Pakistani army must end with silent support for terrorist groups."
He is the head of WikiLeaks
Obama appoints a high-ranking worker in charge of combating terrorism to avoid new information leaks.
Interpol is issuing a "red call" to track down and determine where Assange might be.
Everything related to WikiLeaks and its founder Julian Assange is a complicated labyrinth where it’s hard to be sure of the facts.
Yesterday, Interpol announced an "emergency call", the so-called red note, to "locate and monitor the movement" of Assange.
However, this is not a classic arrest warrant.
In addition, this challenge is not new, but dates to November 20.
And it has nothing to do with the last leak of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that Australians face in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks founder Mark Stephens assures that “the police know where and how to contact Mr Assange.”
It was November 20, when an international police force based in Lyon, France, issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not publish it until yesterday, when it received permission from the Swedish authorities.
In this situation, 188 Interpol countries have instructions on identifying or locating Assange “in order to impose a temporary bond on him and issue it.”
Although Interpol cannot order the detention of a person concerned with the red call, many Member States, as the organization explained, consider the so-called order notices to allow detention to be carried out - this must be ensured by the national police department - in the case of the detainees, especially in the case of the detainees, and in the case of the detainees, in which they are detained.
The move haunted Assenge’s lawyers, who published a paper yesterday stating that the thirty-nine-year-old Wikileaks founder was willing to answer questions from the Swedish authorities through a videoconferencing.
They also recall that Assange requested and subsequently received permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor's office of his case, which they are comparing to legendary Lavrenti Pavlovic Berij, the head of Stalin's security.
"This is hunting, not legal persecution," the letter said.
While the whole world is searching for her – and her mother is defending her son’s innocence from Australia – Assange is still in an unknown place, though he is not silent.
On Monday, he provided an interview with the editor-in-chief of Time from an unknown location via Skype – in this interview, he demanded the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
“If she turns out to be responsible for the U.S. diplomats’ order to spy on the UN and violate international conventions signed by the United States, she should resign,” he said.
His opinion was rejected yesterday by White House press spokesman Robert Gibbs, who described the demand for death as " ridiculous and absurd".
“I’m not quite sure why we should care about the opinion of the individual who runs the website,” he told CNN.
Obama himself commissioned a high-ranking anti-terrorist worker, Russell Traverse, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama’s intention to stop adding importance to Assange contrasts with the views that conservative politicians and commentators have expressed these days.
Peter King, a congressman who will be chairing the National Security Committee in the lower house in January, asked the foreign ministry to explore the possibility of including Wikileaks among terrorist organizations, "so that it would be possible to intervene and prosecute anyone who would financially contribute or help them."
Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, said Assange should be "killed" and had to revoke him.
"Obama should write down a reward or use an unmanned aircraft or something like that."
Those who did not apologize were Mike Huckabee, a Baptist priest, a former governor of Arkansas and a possible presidential candidate.
"Anyone in the government who is responsible for the information leak has committed treason and any other punishment than execution would be too mild," Fox said in a statement.
Puigcercós seeks calm by "darking" in the ERC on the back of Caroda
The Republican leader will allow the party to hold a secret vote on its stay.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the meeting system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe for combating several internal uprisings in the ERC (Left Republican Party of Catalonia), inconsequential due to the loss of 11 MEPs and half of the votes.
The president of the party is aware that his gesture regarding the demise seems insufficient to the supporters of former leader Josep Lluís Caroda-Rovira, and also knows that the influence of this sector is now as weak as his own leader, and that he could absolutely not do for his own people such an old man.
That’s why Leice’s leader will try to gain new criticism by means of blackmail, which will help him turn to the municipal elections.
First, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the national committee will be able to secretly declare his tenure.
With ballots, not by lifting your hand.
If Caroda’s supporters want to pass a criminal vote on the president, they will be able to do so without fear of retaliation.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid the bribery and subjugation of his person.
In several interviews he claimed that he would not consider himself confirmed with half of the votes and one more, but added, without specifying the percentage, that he would also not be a good result "after Bulgaria".
The supporters of Caroda demand more from the president than to make his office available - which they consider a gesture that has no weight, since Puigcercós controls the largest organ at the conventions.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to enforce the demise, they will try to resemble the executive plan from now until May.
Therefore, they expect to participate in the preparation of a strategic reorientation document, which the leadership can vote on at the National Council on the 18th of the month.
Their aim is to support Puigcercós in exchange for promising to relocate Congress in the autumn of 2011.
The leader of the ERC said that “multi-speech” is damaging stability, and that its goal is to make the organization able to wash its dirty laundry at closed doors once and for all.
In this context, there seems to be a symptomatic article signed by the current adviser Josep Huguet on his blog.
After taking Puigcercós’ ideologist into account, this innovation advisor considered it a ready-made matter that the leader would be confirmed "in exchange for several goals".
And he named them five, of which two are outstanding.
The first is to "recompose" the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the members, which means to include also new faces that are from the Carod-like sector.
The second goal can be a big news.
Huguet proposes that the ERC ends up completely with the meeting as a mechanism for functioning.
And so he fights for the reform of the statutes so that congresses can be held through delegates elected by voting.
Ending the model of the meeting system, an exception in the Spanish political party system, is the intended goal of Puigcercós’ team, who has already fought in this direction at the last two meetings.
However, the 2008 controversy meeting decided that the meeting must be assessed at a special congress on statute reforms.
This matter is still unresolved, as the situation within the party reflected the solution of the matter.
Now, without the staggering critical sectors, it could be a good time to deal with this issue again and try to close it once and for all.
23 murdered in November; 390 in 2010
According to the MILENIO Journal, Mexico has seen a 4-fold decline compared to 2010.
In November, 23 people were killed in Mexico, four fewer than in the previous month, according to the MILENIO newspaper.
Among the murders are the cases of three women and the discovery of a pair of separate bodies in the Valley of Mexico.
In the last month of the year, there are a total of 390 deaths in Mexico, probably related to organized crime.
Among the cases, the body was found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, in the district of Toluca.
The victim suffered at least three gunshot wounds, another wound from grace to the head, and had arms and legs tied to the rope.
The next day, a body was found in the trunk, which was stored in the luggage compartment of the vehicle above Mixtecas Street, in the colony of Santa Cruz Acatlán, in Naucalpan district.
Early in the morning on Thursday, 4 November, co-workers discovered the body carrying signs of torture and at least three deadly shots into the chest near the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal motorway in the Villa Guerrero district.
Next to the body was a report signed by the alleged criminal organization La Familia Michoacán.
A day later in Nezahualcóyotl, a fifty-year-old man was killed by eight shots after he left his house and wanted to start collecting garbage.
On November 7, two victims were shot in the head at the age of 30 in the colony of San Pedro Xalaxtoc, Ecatepec.
In Chalco, a corpse of a man shot in the forehead was found on a distant road in El Naranjo colony, and under the body was found a bullet from a caliber 25 weapon.
In Ecatepec, parts of the human body were found in the sewage channel in the colony of Playa Golondrina.
Rescue files have done a thorough search for other parts of it, but they have not been found.
The residents of Tepotzotlán reported finding the body with their hands tied back and wrapped in a head at the site of Pena Colorada.
The man had a gunshot wound on his back.
In the middle of the month, the murder of two men, who were packed in bed linen and left in the luggage room of the vehicle in Villas de la Hacienda in the district of Atizapán de Zaragoza, was reported and reports of death were also found among the victims.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony in the Los Reyes La Paz district.
In a nearby colony, the rest of the body was found, wrapped in a black plastic bag, with a report from El Incorregible.
The seventeen were found two dead women wrapped in bed linen in the settlement of Zoquiapan in the district of Ixtapaluca, and the next morning in Huixquilucan was found a murdered man wrapped in a yellow-blue sheet, which was previously identified as a marioss, according to the report.
In Ixtapaluca, a woman with no signs of life was found in the village of San Francisco Acuautla with two wounds in the back.
On the skin of the woman was discovered a tattoo of the holy figure of Santa Muerte (literally "Holy Death" - known as trans.) and also necklaces with its likeness.
At the end of the month, a man with at least a third gunshot wound and a report was found in the car in the village of Zinacantepec.
Two days later, the bodies of two men were found with their heads wrapped in a ribbon and a report was found in the village of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In the case of the victims, a report was probably written by one of the criminal organizations, stating: "This will happen to those who do not adapt."
In Ecatepec, two bodies were found carrying marks of torture and bound limbs inside an abandoned taxi behind the Justice Centre in the colony of San Agustín.
The last day of the month, the remains of two men were found in the districts of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first was found in the Cuchilla Ancón colony and was packed in black plastic bags, tied with a belt and had a message left with him; while the second was tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Along with him, the agents also found a note with the report.
China's Goal to Reduce Greenhouse Gases
The country’s representative at the UN Climate Change Conference COP16 assured that its country has made extraordinary efforts to reduce its carbon footprint, and said it insists on its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40-45% by 2020.
China will keep its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40-45% in 2020, said Su Wei, the country’s representative at the UN climate change conference.
In his first public speech at the 16th Conference of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Su Wei assured that his country had made tremendous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and transform its industry.
He said his country had already invested <0x24>245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions over the past four years.
However, he made it clear that China will not change its goals and will continue to work with the international community on this issue.
He pointed out that China's climate change strategy is divided into four elements: dialogue, capacity building, institution building, and support for pilot programmes.
They have already made progress on all these points, including last year’s approval of the new Energy Act, which includes proposed targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, he explained.
He also stressed that in China, the federal authorities have cooperated in coordination with provincial and local authorities to achieve their goals in terms of energy savings, energy efficient use and emissions reduction.
Furthermore, he said, various multi-annual plans are underway or have already been completed, which are funded by both the Chinese government and the governments of other states.
For example, as he pointed out, it is about the Energy Efficiency Programme, which has been implemented over the last five years and received investment from the United Nations, government and private initiatives.
The provincial climate change project is also underway, the project of replacement of light bulbs for savings and the project of mitigation and adaptation, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country’s expert advisor on climate change, assured China’s efforts were greater than generally thought.
For example, he calculated, greenhouse gas emissions per capita represent 6 tons in China, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9% of the historical share of emissions.
It has also developed unprecedented energy use efforts – for example, it has increased energy efficiency by 20% over the last five years and is expected to make further progress by 2020.
Legal Exclusion of Espina: César Nava
The President of the National Party of the PAN (Partido Acción Nacional, Czech National Action Party) said that the former president of this party is entitled to request from the National Order Commission of its law.
The National President of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, has assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espina Barrientos has been legalized, and that the former president of the party is entitled to turn to the National Order Commission and claim his rights.
In an interview with Gabinet Cué Monteagudo, Governor of the state, he said that the exclusion of Espina is, in any case, a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Regulatory Commission."
"Mr Espino has the right, in his case, to appeal to the National Council's Regulatory Commission in order to be a decision taken by the competent authority," he added.
He further explained that now is not the time to think about 2012, and that she has never been at the negotiating table about the presidential nomination of the alliance.
Nava Vázquez expressed his conviction that the PAN will emerge from the internal elections held on 4 and 5 December, in which his successor will be elected, reinforced.
“This (the alliance in 2012) is a topic that has never been at the negotiating table, at least not so far, it was the intention for local elections that was successful and fulfilled its purpose,” he said.
The President of the PAN said that 71 years of dialogue were behind him, and that is why "we do not undermine our internal competitiveness, on the contrary, we benefit from it and strengthen us," he added.
He said the committee could choose the best chairman or chairman he deserves for the next three years without a debate, so he would pass the staff on to "who the committee will appoint."
"So I am absolutely calm and relaxed, any of the five with pride, to the office of the party president."
He predicted that the party's rise in the last elections in July would be reflected in future clans, although "it's not yet time to think about 2012".
"It is now necessary to accompany Governor Gabin Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that these three governments, rooted in alliances in Oaxaca, Pueble and Sinaloa, will represent the flag and will be the subject of observation throughout the country, since "they are instilled many expectations and aspirations into them", and I am sure that Ga's
When we asked him about the criticism of President Felipe Calderón by the PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institucional, Czech Revolutionary Institutional Party) for his speeches in the four years that he will rule, Cesar Nava called on the members of the Presidents of the Republic of Serbia and the Presidents of the Republic of Serbia to resign.
“If in the PRI they think the governments of Zedilla and Salinas were better than the government of Fox and Claderón, let them start defending them, let them get out of their way,” he said.
He stated that the head of the federal executive power has the right to express himself as he did during a speech at the National Auditorium, as there is no use of bribery or censorship in this country.
Obama Advocates a Law on Supporting Students Without Documents on Twitter
“If you think that the Dream Act’s approval is correct, let your senators know and urge them to pass it,” the president tweeted on Twitter.
President Barack Obama today joined a national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, which should legalize students without documents, via his personal Twitter account.
“If you think that the Dream Act’s approval is correct, let your senators know and urge them to pass it,” Obama tweeted.
His brief report draws attention to an internet link to a more comprehensive document asking the public to contact senators immediately as the vote on this law is approaching.
"Since it is expected that the vote will take place soon, now is the time to let your opinion be heard," he said.
The report was released after 42 Republican senators threatened to block the approval of any law unless the extension of Bush-era tax cuts and government funding was approved.
Such a blockade, announced by a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects, such as the ratification of a new treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons, called START.
When asked about the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other proposals, the presidential spokesman said he believes that once the fiscal issue is resolved, it will be possible to draw up a calendar for the rest of the projects.
"I believe there's still plenty of time left..."
"We all agree that we must resolve the tax issue before the end of the year..."
I believe that we can at some point reach an agreement on this matter and then we will be able to plan the order of other matters," he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that he would ask for a "closed debate" on the Dream Act, so a proposal to legalize students without documents could be voted in the Senate from next Thursday, although it may be the next day.
The Senate’s approval of the Dream Act, or “American Dream Act,” would legalize about 800,000 young people who entered the United States before they were 16 years old, who have resided in the country for the past five years and were admitted to a higher education institution or to the military.
However, supporters need 60 votes to approve the bill, which is why they need the help of several Republicans, so the organizations of its supporters are undergoing intensive agitation to ensure that the bill is approved.
Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 mandates.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, expressed his support for the bill.
That’s why supporters of the Dream Act need to get a few Republicans in case other Democrats decide to reject the proposal.
Among the Republican senators with whom supporters are most negotiating are senators from Maine Olympia Snowe and Susan Colins, as well as retired senator from Florida George Lemieux, who supplemented the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have supported Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchison from Texas, but they said they will no longer support it next time.
Another Republican who supported the proposal, John McCain, has not yet spoken out at this point.
Although the House of Representatives clings to a different version, according to most analysts, the Dream Act will face the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
with the literature put the finger in the wound ("poner el dedo en la llaga", translated "put the finger in the wound" is the period of the Czech "to study the nail on the head - translate.)
The second round of the language pleasure cycle was a promenade where the participants presented the literary gala performances
"I understand this with sex in the language, but... finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was invited to start the second cycle of pleasure from the language, a cycle that celebrates the literacy of the pencil written in the Spanish language.
The finger in the wound "brings us into the narrow", said the Argentine writer to the audience, composed mostly of young people, who met at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara to hear this debate with Mr. Mayro<0xC3><0xB2>, Mr. Montez<0xC4><0x8D>í, Mr. Valdery, Mr. Schder.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celori, which Schultz later described as a great story in which she portrayed Luisa in the first person as the protagonist, who, in seeking knowledge of what she is, goes from a doctor to a doctor who does not walk away from her.
From the infectologist, she leaves convinced: “Patience is not my strength, maybe it will be my wound.”
Finally, after frustrating with the traumatologist who took her breath in the middle of the road, but explained that the wound is not a scientific term, it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the secret: "the wound represents it truly widened and thus symbolic is the scar."
The protagonist calmly breathed and concluded that "on the morning she only managed to find out so much that it was really wide open and there is no", but she gained the conviction that the pleasures and fears in the language must go hand in hand.
Writer Valenzuela played with both of them.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also performed with a charming tale, which he called Praise Invention, in which the finger is not named in the wound, but appears at one point.
With elements of magical realism, she tells the story of a famous witch who played the clouds, brought back people who went far away, or corrected the honor lost by a virgin, this tale, which then turned to be a tale, a tale, a tale of America, a tale, a tale of a great novel, a tale of
“Cervantes, who invented us all, laughed at the fictional testimony that was presented in the stories as real, but in another way he never managed to tell the story of America with such imagery that he lacked even the Stud.”
However, he stressed, "they are the fools and liars who have a greater imagination" and precisely where the reality and the lie come together, where it is no longer known what the story belongs to one group and what the other, the fictional literature reaches its peak.
It’s called the “cervant tradition.”
"Thanks to his reference, we have what we have."
Subsequently, Mayra Montero emphasized and praised the diversity of interpretations that the invitation of the International Book Fair with her word Finger into the wound enabled.
A Cuban-Portuguese writer has pointed her finger to a great deal of social violence that is going through her country – and shared by Latin America – and is a result of trade disputes and drug sales.
"I think good literature, good poetry, and good songs conclude a quiet compromise, which of course is not intended," she said after stating that the reality of literature is communication and the dimension of the compromise that is created between the author and the readers.
The evening was closed by Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose performance also emphasized "this finger in the wound of the writer committed by the writer".
He said that in a world that lives in haste, also in intellectual habits and in the control of consciousness that overlaps dogmatism, he forgets that "there is a small yes behind every attachment, and there is a small yes behind every denial".
"In order to be masters of our thoughts and reality, we must color: and coloring means many times putting a finger in the wound and harassing those individuals who are much more comfortable because they think in cartoons, in black and white, in the mind, in the mind, in the mind, in the mind, in the mind, in the mind, in the mind, in the mind, and in the mind."
Romano goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano reads three defeats in the final, during his career he experienced both good and bad, but he has already managed to achieve on three occasions in the decisive series.
in the Santos Laguna and Monterrey duel in the final, in addition to clashing two different styles with their techniques, teams that have a visible difference in results.
Rubén Omar Romano reads three defeats in the final, during his career he experienced both good and bad, but he was able to achieve already on three occasions in the decisive series, but until now he left with the unmatched, and that is why this chance is extraordinary for him.
The Argentinian had to settle for the silver medal, remained a step behind the winner and curiously played with the same team in the next final.
The Santistic strategist reached his first final in the 2002 Apertura tournament when he was in the hands of Morelia, with whom he scored a total of 4-2 against Toluca; then in the 2003 Clausura tournament he again entered the decisive duel and also lost it with a 3-0 win.
Already with Santos Laguna in Torneo Bicentenario 2010, again against the "Devils" from Toluca, Rubén suffered a defeat again, although his team played against the "Uzenars" (the other nickname of the club Deportivo Toluca - 2 points, 2 points to 4 points, 2 points to 11 points) after 210 minutes.
Rubén has already lost two finals against the Red Devils from Toluca and one against Monterrey, his future rival, so he would like to avoid the same fate and get rid of the curse, so he could celebrate the title for the first time, although he says that the institute is the best for him.
"I want to go out as a winner, I don't want to break the statistics, this is for the club, for the passion I'm committed to, and the title would of course be for me, but that first is the most important thing," the coach said when asked about the numbers that speak out against him in the final.
In his live memory he has a previous finale in which, as he confirms, he has learned a lot, "we have learned that until the referee writes the end, we cannot celebrate, we must be prepared for the action, we just do not think of the players, because the past two penalties, we have been beaten, we have been beaten, we have not been able to celebrate."
He doesn't worry that we're going to be able to do this series in a criminal shoot, but he trusts his players: "You're never trying to get to the series of criminal kicks, you're trying to end up in the normal time, but sometimes we're going to have no other option, but we're going to have to be in the right, and we need to be in the wrong time.
Romano has a chance in his hands to stop being the second and taste the first glory they bring titles.
The United States changes the rules for visa issuance
People will have to contact the Visa Applicant Services centres even before an interview with the Consular Department; the costs will be lower and the waiting time will be shortened.
As of January 10, 2011, the process of negotiating visas at the Embassy of the United States and Consulates will change.
With the new procedure, the majority of applicants will have to contact the Visa Applicant Services (ASC) centres before an interview with the Consular Department.
The ASC staff will collect the applicant’s biometric information and will be evaluated by the Consular Department before the interview.
The new approach will have certain advantages, including the following:
The total cost of issuing a visa will be lower, there will no longer be a fee for arranging a meeting, the second for processing the application and the other for delivering the document by the transport service.
The applicant shall pay only one fee that covers all three services.
The current tariff will remain unchanged: <0x24>140 for tourist visas, <0x24>150 for visa applications (including visas for temporary workers) and <0x24>390 for trader and investor visas.
People who want to renew their visa will not have to interview a consular official, but will only contact the nearest ASC, where they will submit their documents and get their fingerprints.
Since biometric information will be collected in the ASC, applicants who will require a second meeting with an interview at the Consular Department will spend less time here than in the past.
Similarly, those who will apply for a visa at the consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay an extra <0x24>26 fee for the service.

NASA to announce the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The U.S. Space Agency has convened a press conference tomorrow to present a discovery that could cause a break in the search for extraterrestrial life.
The National Aviation and Space Agency (NASA) will announce on Thursday an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 13:00 p.m. by experts in astrobiology, a science that deals with the study of the origin, evolution, dissemination and future of life in space, at a press conference at NASA’s headquarters in Washington.
Inviting journalists, NASA assured that it would present a "discovery that will cause a breakdown in the search for extraterrestrial life," sparking speculation by experts from other countries.
The discovery could confirm the theory that there are, besides us, other creatures living in uninhabitable conditions that were considered uninhabitable, and that could imagine the possibility of one day becoming intelligent creatures, such as humans, if the conditions in which they live improve.
It is believed to be a microbe found at the bottom of Lake Mono in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was considered too toxic to any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
The form somehow uses arsenic for its life, and it is this ability that increases the likelihood that similar life could exist on other planets that do not have the atmosphere that it is on Earth.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be proven that "there is another, another form of life, different from the one we know."
The Space Agency will announce the real scope of the discoveries at a press conference tomorrow.
The conference is attended by geologist Pamela Conrado, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who explores Titan (the largest moon of Saturn) with the prospect that its chemical composition is similar to that of Earth.
PRD, PT, Covergencia and Patrón raise opposition ‘block’
The reforms of the Constitutional Law on Congress lead to the advent of “bipartisanism”, they declare.
Even the 60th parliamentary term has not yet begun, when an opposition bloc was formed in Congress, led by the party MPs of the PRD (Partido de la Revolución Democrática, Czech "Partido de la Revolución Democrática"), the PT (Partido del Trabajo), the "manufacturer" (Manuscrito del Trabajo), the "Manufacturer.
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez from Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo from the PRD and Patrón Montalvo "shocked" against the reform of the Constitutional Law, as it excludes them.
With this reform, they repeated, “bapartism” begins, because now it will be two people from the same number of parties who will control Congress.
These four MEPs, together with Gloria Santos Aquilar, the coordinator of the PRD party, were the only ones who voted against the Council, led by Salvador López Brite on behalf of the PAN (Partido Acción, Czech "National Action Party" - <0xD0><0xBD><0xD0><0xBE><0xD0><0xB4><0xD0><0xBE><0xD0><0xB4><0xD0><0xB5> <0xD0><0xB2><0xD0><0xBE><0xD0><0xBD><0xD0><0xB5><0xD1><0x81><0xD1><0x81><0xD1><0x81><0xD1><0x82><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBC>.
Corvera Quevedo said that these reforms institutionally constitute political marginality from the populist parties PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institucional, Czech "Revolutionary Institutional Party") and PAN.
He said they would talk to representatives of the PAN and PRI parties over the next few days to modify the scheme on the basis of political will, and if they do not have it, they would again be subject to these two parties, ending the opposition coalition.
“When [the opposition coalition] came here, that’s what I look at, because we’re excluded from any decision, they don’t even have a willingness to consider the opinions of others.”
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, on behalf of Convergencia, said that PRD, PT and Patrón agreed and would therefore form a pluralist group.
It is impossible to allow, he continued, that Congress, after being monopoly, was now "duopoly".
The aspiration of law reform is not to have endless bipartisanism in Congress.
This group starts with five legislators and its members are now discussing with other colleagues to get more votes, as Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez added.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from the PT explained that at the moment Congress has become a "benefit" of two - in a rally on the PAN and PRI sides.
“Earlier it was controlled by only one side, today it is divided by two.”
Patron Montalvo asked that the Member's personality be respected and that he be given a seat at the negotiating table.
"In order for the five Members of Parliament, who are probably already nine, but right now see us at five, not to be left behind because of the distorted agreements, each in a different faction, we have come together to find a place with each other and to get a seat at the negotiating table."
Another 200,000 pesos is issued for “supplier”
The town hall in Mazatlan will pay another cheque to the owner of the company that supplies electrical materials.
Another cheque of a little over 200,000 pesos was sent by the mayor to Lorena Guadalupe Camach Palazuelos.
The amount paid in the second half of this year to the owner of the company supplying the electrical material amounts to 1,200,000 pesos.
According to the transparency page of the town hall, this last check number 9258447 was sent on 16 November of this year, it was issued at a volume of 200,144,56 pesos and as its subject was stated "comparation of unreserved payments".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno noted that the municipality would pay this supplier, which was monitored by the Supreme State Audit Office for sales at high prices, another fee.
What has not been said is the total amount that the City Council still owes her, and how many more cheques will be sent in favour of Camach Palazuelos.
"There was nothing bought now, only what we owe her, as well as other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two days on October 15, October 19, October 29, and November 16.
Although this businesswoman has not yet been published in the Official Gazette, as the law states in the case of companies audited by the Supreme State Audit Office to prevent their services from being used by other administrative authorities, the cashier has ensured that the company does not re-enter the services.
In the previous period, after July 25, the journal Noroeste published a review of the cheques exhibited by the town hall to its suppliers, which revealed that in the period from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, during the three-year period of Mayor Jorge Abel López, 42-million wickets in Sánchez, paid by the city.
She also carried out a transaction with Jumapa, where she collected cheques for more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist spots need to be maintained.
Tourist managers complain about the accident of a foreign tourist because of the poor condition of the village of Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlan.
After the fall of a foreign tourist into the depths of the resident of Sánchez Taboada, the tourism sector in Mazatlan asks the authorities to pay attention to areas and places that are in poor condition, not showing the port in good light.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Zona Dorada Business Association, reminded that they repeatedly asked to look after the destination, the bad that tourists find here, to be replaced by new activities or routes.
He said that the poor condition of the streets and pedestrians affects tourists who walk here and see disorder, which adversely affects nearby businesses.
“Policies don’t know what it’s like to shut down a business for a day, and they have no idea of the sales they’re avoiding, otherwise they wouldn’t have solved these issues for so long and without proper planning.”
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the fall of tourists caused a lack of preventive measures and maintenance by the city council.
"The council will have to take responsibility and prevent such a thing from happening again, it will have to focus on preventive maintenance, not just repair existing faults," he said.
We would like to enjoy a clean city, because not only because we are a tourist area, we should do maintenance, because even as residents we deserve a clean housing, the city council should change its city maintenance strategy."
There are also other places that look neglected and poor, he noted, such as the Mazatlan Emblem and El Venadito (monument, the statue of the deer - known as the transc.).
"Today, to get tourists, it is not only about promotion, it is necessary to offer a good product, i.e. a city that is infused with the cleanliness of its beaches and streets, where the constant maintenance of tourist attractions is carried out," he said.
"There was not enough attention here, and these facts emphasize something that is well known to everyone, maintenance is lacking.
He talked about a number of places that need to be put in order in cooperation with the town hall, he said that the priority must be to keep the city clean and in order to be attractive because it has tourist potential.
Raúl Llera Martínez, the sub-deputy of Tourism Promotion, said that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlan is urgent because they are not properly used and do not make a good impression.
Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural destinations and spaces, but it will need to be put in order first in order to attract these places and to be able to put them on the list we have for the promotion of this destination.”
IP calls for results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, would like Members to take on a great responsibility by setting an example in the search for a better Sinaloa, in the various challenges facing the state.
A parliamentary term full of decent work and without agreements between the parties and the State Executive is demanding by the business sector in Mazatlan, as Sinaloa is confused in cramps and faces major problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th parliamentary term, consisting of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 from the PAN, three from the Partido Nueva Alianza, two from the PRD, one from the PT, one from the Convergencia and the last from the PVEM, which includes a total of 40 national representatives.
The list of expectations from the new members of Congress is that they will be able to implement decent leadership, with commitments to society and different areas that require responsible legislative work, and that the same party and paternalist patterns will not be repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, chairman of the Coordination Business Council (CCE), proposed that the newly elected 40 members of Congress take on a great responsibility and set an example on the way to a better Sinaloa in the various challenges they face.
"We expect MEPs to actually exercise their right, without agreements between the parties, because they usually take measures to promote their own interests and become carnival tours of rulers and parliamentary factions."
He therefore spoke of the need to reaffirm the obligation to establish the necessary overlap that would move the ruling party forward in order.
“We want them to do a decent job and to be committed to society and sectors above all, because it was the Sinaloa people who gave them their confidence in the past elections with their vote.”
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, President of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, said that one of the biggest challenges for 40 national representatives will gather all the strength to achieve economic growth in the country because the current economic situation is very complex.
The most important thing is to encourage economic growth to create incentives for investment and infrastructure, which will in some way foster job creation.”
As far as tourism is concerned, he requested that new legislators give him greater importance within the state budget and support to the Ministry of Tourism.
“I’ve learned that it’s the second-lowest-budget ministry, which is disproportionate given that it’s an important economic activity, bringing currency and investment, which is also directly competing with agriculture.”
In addition to spending funds on start-up tourism projects, Congress should help provide the state with certainty and help with the Alcohol Act that failed to be resolved in previous parliamentary sessions.
Searching for Three Kings
Dolls, carts and bicycles are included in the wish list of children in the Coronado Valenzuela family along with other toys.
For their parents, it will be difficult for them to fulfill their dreams about the upcoming feast of the Three Kings, as their household reads exactly 12 people and one rabbit.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Kaspar, Melichar and Baltazar will make them the toys and clothes they so long for.
The family lives in a modest residence in the village of Colonia Salvador Allende in poor proportions because his father has no permanent job.
"Sometimes it's hard because my husband isn't lucky, but we sell mandarins and potatoes... In the afternoon I go out on the street with the "wolves" to sell on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuel Andrade, the mother of the children.
Four-year-old Adelaide wants a doll or a bike, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a doll Barbie.
As for ten-year-old José Alfredo, he would have wanted a “monster” car for some time now, and for his eight-month-old brother, Jesus, Cayetana would have wanted clothes in the size of a year.
“He told me [José Alfredo] ‘I wish I had this monster car,’ but I told him ‘we’ll see my son,’ because it was very expensive.”
For older children who were just in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
Maria Guadalupe, who is 11 years old, has a size of 12, a ten-year-old Isaiah size of 10, while an eight-year-old Miguel wears a size of 8.
Fourteen-year-old José Juan is missing a pair of shoes, so he would be able to fit a pair of sizes five and a half or six.
To help fulfill the dreams of children from the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the campaign "Seeking Three Kings", and at the reception of the Noroeste diary to bring gifts or cash.
14 Suspected Drug Traffickers Who Were Arrested
Ten tours were conducted in Estonia on Wednesday, as part of the liquidation of the network for the production and sale of Indian cannabis.
Fourteen people were arrested and faced various charges.
The tours took place in Sherbrooke, Orford, and Stoke, mostly in places used to manufacture drugs.
"Approximately 750 shots of Indian cannabis, four kilograms of hashish, money and equipment used to produce it were seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a Quebec police spokesman.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, including two men from Sherbrooke, both suspected of being the head of the entire network.
The detainees had to go to the Sherbrooke Courthouse after their arrest.
They could face charges of producing Indian cannabis, holding it for the purpose of trading it, conspiracy and theft, among other things.
These inspections were subsequently carried out after a long-term investigation that lasted almost a year.
“It was the information we received from the public that allowed us to access these arrests,” Ruel said.
This police operation was attended by 70 police officers of the regional Estrie City Investigation Service of the Quebec State Police, the State Police in Sherbrooke and the Sherbrooke Memphrémagog Police Administration.
Illegal migration can continue without problems.
The bill of conservatives, which the government says should regulate the problem of ships loaded with illegal immigrants, will obviously be overrun, while all three opposition parties said on Wednesday they could not support it.
"I'm relying heavily on the charter."
"I stand directly on the side of the party that built a gullet under your feet," said Michael Ignatieff, the head of the Liberal Party, surrounded by a deputy after a weekly meeting of the weekly du caucus.
Liberals insist that the bill, as it is proposed, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, a law that would allow the detention of up to one year of any person originating from a ship, identified as a ship carrying illegal immigrants.
The head of the Quebec Bloc, Gilles Duceppe, also said he could not support the bill because it is heading towards a wrong goal.
“We are against and all opposition parties seem to be against, so we’ll see what the government will do,” Duceppe said.
NPD critic Olivia Chow, on the issue of immigration, has rejected critics who want her party not to be strong enough as far as illegal immigrants are concerned.
“Neo-Democrats agree to take action against the translators of illegal immigrants, and that’s what we consider to be the bearer of another bill, the C-35,” Chow said.
“We do not support the Conservative bill because it blames refugees and imprisons children for at least one year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused the opposition parties.
"Canadians are mass informing MEPs that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that take Canada to the brim and treat it like some kind of patholytic," he said.
They expect Canada to take coherent measures, Minister Kenney said.
The government has not cast a vote of confidence in its bill, which could lead the country to elections leading to its rejection.
One conservative told the QMI agency that the government will ask for a vote so that every MP who opposes will be held accountable for his or her voters.
New unity does not mean unanimity.
Despite the announcement of a possible establishment of a permanent anti-corruption and anti-corruption unit, many observers continue to demand the establishment of a public inquiry commission on the issue.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, strives to ensure that this idea is not forgotten: Quebec intends to consult with the Department of Investigation of New York in January next year.
The metropolis has had a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
That's why Tuesday's announcement surprised none of us.
It should be noted that at the meeting of the Permanent Council for Police Services in Quebec on 29 October last year, this measure was not discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil himself.
More than that, it was not necessary for PQ critic Stéphane Bergeron to classify this announcement as "the rabbit pulled out of the hat" and a "amateur's solution slipped on his knees".
Minister Dutil himself responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future of unity.
"They'll be satisfied with the confirmation: you'll see the result when we announce it."
"We are aware of this problem."
For CSQ President Réjean Parenta, nothing can replace the establishment of a witness interrogation at a public hearing.
"Moreover, Mr. Charest insists that he doesn't want to set up this commission of inquiry, and people think, like you and me, that he's hiding something," he explains.
“The only way to achieve the creation of an inquiry commission is by the death of Jean Charest,” explains Yves Boisvert, Professor of Ethics and Political Science at the Institute for Higher Education.
In order to get out of this blind alley, he proposed to Quebec to grant a special mandate to the Inspector General so that he could investigate collusion and corruption.
"We need to be able to extend the mandate of the Inspector General," he said.
He also believes that Quebec could give the inspector the same powers as the commissioners who allow people to donate to witness.
Establishing a permanent working group is not the only proposal in the Charest government’s records.
Quebec would also, after Ottawa, change the Penal Code so that it would be better adapted to this type of crime.
This requirement would be based on the Marteau (Kladivo) Officer, who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marco Fournier that the case-law in this kind of investigation is not explicit.
The Federal Minister for Public Security, Vic Toews, confirmed that his colleague from the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with some amendments related to this file.
131 people were arrested during Operation Spring 2001, which affected groups of bikers, although the Criminal Code was not yet amended.
Ottawa subsequently allowed amendments to the Gangster Act.
Rivers under strict supervision.
Several water flows have come under strict control due to heavy rainfall, which has fallen since Tuesday in several regions of the province.
On Wednesday afternoon, a landslide occurred in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
The two houses were preventively evacuated.
In the evening there was another landslide in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
The road is overlooked.
Between Tuesday and Wednesday evening, several regions were hit by heavy precipitation, i.e. between 40 and 70 millimetres.
A further 20 to 40 millimeters were not expected from today to Thursday evening, according to the region.
The northern sections of the river and the Outaouais Valley were the most affected.
It could fall up to 100 millimetres in total.
If we consider these precipitations with the melting of snow accumulated in some sectors, we may be afraid of flooding in some water streams.
The Quebec Rescue Service issued a warning Wednesday evening against flooding hazards for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
Rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentides, and in Chennai, in Lotbinière, became the subject of flood alertness and continuous control.
In the area of Lanaudière, heavy waterfalls caused the dilution of some lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
A temporary bridge was demolished in Saint-Calixte as a result of heavy rains.
Two residences had to be evacuated.
In Outaouais, the melting of some lakes off the coast caused the closure of some roads, especially in the village of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The Emergency Service has an emergency and is monitoring the situation in the area, said Annik Bouchard, the security adviser.
The Quebec Center for Flood Prediction issued warnings on Wednesday against severe flooding for several rivers, in particular Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially blaming
Quebec radio moderator Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial accident before the Canadian Radio and Television Standards Council (RRTV) due to controversial statements regarding social assistance and Haitians and, as well as due to gross extortion.
The Radio and Television Council considers that Mr. Dupont and his group from CHOI 98,1 FM had the right to express their views, but some statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance and inadequate negative disclosures of Haitians".
The Council also concluded that the discussion of suicide, including the broadcasting of the names of the two persons who took their lives, did not violate the rules for radio broadcasting.
The Broadcasting Council has received a number of complaints regarding comments made during broadcasting, broadcasted between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made after a complaint by the Common Front of Social Support recipients of Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts indicated in the broadcast were inaccurate.
Moderators must provide reliable information, not false.
As for suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont thought suicide was a gesture of despair.
Most members of the Commission concluded that the report transmitted was such that suicide could not be understood as a solution to the problems of everyday life.
"The majority of the Commission believes that the controversial episodes of the broadcast of the Dupont Lunch Reports have come across a delicate topic in an impartial and appropriate way."
There was no controversy with him.
The last dispute was about a statement that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort went into the media outlet, which triggered many reactions.
The CHOI moderator said he did not send any gifts to help the Haitians, because we cannot be sure that they will actually get the money they need.
The Commission considers that these comments were not unjustified, but that their cumulative effect creates an improperly negative image of Haitians.
"I've already settled my three-day delay on that thing."
"My file has been intact for a year and a half," the moderator said.
In all decisions, the Commission refuses to use gross expressions for broadcasting.
In any case, CHOI-FM radio broadcasting cooperated "over the limits of its responsibilities".
For the station, which will, inter alia, have to notify this decision once during the main broadcast within three days, the consequences are minimal.
King of the Kung Fu, Montreal.
The population of Montreal, originating in Algeria, Nacereddine Zemmal, has an extremely special time.
An athlete who excels in "sand" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing enters tatami and rings around the world and is looking for new challenges.
"I started with martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria," explained Zemmal, who has been living in the capital city since 2008 to learn from professionals.
“In my case, I’m looking for matches a little bit everywhere because for those who don’t like the game on the ground that appears in combat sports, competitions in North America are rare.”
Recently, this man, who works as a security guard and as an assistant to UPS, just gave his opponents bad news when he won two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) World Championships, from October 23 to 30, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the category of kickboxing full contact and Thai boxing," he said.
"I'm currently preparing for the World Cup in a dream show in China."
"The competitors were invited to finish in the first four in the last world championships in each category."
"I won the bronze in Toronto in 2009.
"In 2005, I finished eighth in Vietnam."
"In 2007, I finished in the tournament in fifth place in China, while in Toronto in 2009, I finished third," he added.
“It’s interesting that I’ve made some progress in every competition.”
“I’m going to be the first time this year or tomorrow!”
"san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China, where punches and legs, as well as grounding, are allowed.
The matches are traditionally played on the platform and less rarely in the ring.
The most famous boxer, derived from this form of combat, is the American Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well known in the world of martial arts.
As long as Nacer Zemmal has only one result in his career, he boldly confirms his participation in the King of Sanda Super Bowl in kung fu.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China," explains a sympathetic guy.
"It's a little equivalent for Stade Lumpinee (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first match, in the semi-final of his category (80 kg), before losing in the final.
"The one who beat me was a real professional, he was analyzing."
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals are in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category will be matched so that a single champion, King Kung Fu, can be crowned."
<0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0x24>450 million without public competition
Hydro-Québec has agreed <0x24>450 million in contracts with companies providing engineering for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it is just a consortium formed by companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which have won the most significant contract, a contract to manage the entire project for a total of <0x24>295 million without a public competition.
This consortium, called Énergie gerance, was empowered in 2004 in conjunction with the selection of Hydro-Québec to entrust the private sector with responsibility for the management of this significant <0x24>5 billion hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "Energie gerance" obtained a lucrative contract without any announcement of a public tender.
For the Quebec side, a complaint against a consortium of companies poses a serious ethical problem that risks excluded competition and causes price increases.
"It's a new way of realizing a collision and eliminating competition."
"This means that the people who make side agreements are no longer doing them in secret, they are doing them openly today," PQ MP Sylvain Simard said at a press conference yesterday.
A little earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard asked this question to the National Assembly, because he said that it is difficult to bear how public interest can be sold in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, said in the afternoon, denying that it would be a collision contract.
“I have my own way,” she grumbled, claiming that the PQ was “dishonest” and “lacking accuracy.”
She said "that would be the least" that PQ would apologize.
The recipe for creating a consortium is common practice all over the world.
It is usually an alliance, limited in time, that will allow two or more companies to pool their mutual expertise in order to respond to a call for bids for a comprehensive project.
The Eastmain project is very complex in terms of the scope of the work.
The building is already under construction and must be completed by 2012.
However, the contract was admitted without the competition being able to act; it was a trade.
It should also be acknowledged that the consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir revealed last week, the consortium's formula for engineering consulting is the subject of a government investigation.
If we speed up the business register of Quebec companies, it will allow us to discover more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to have been formed permanently.
Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors; namely CIMA<0x2B>, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to the same legal person, and that is Dessau.
With regard to the consortium Énergie gerance, Minister Normandeau underlined in particular the fact that "the territory of la Baie James is a typical special workforce dynamic and that Hydro-Québec has been reacting to it since the 1970s".
The head of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, from Baie James Energy Company (SEBJ), gave an explanation that forces us to head over the fact that the project management agreement was concluded by mutual agreement.
"If you go to a public contest and if there are few contestants submitting a bid, your bids may be higher."
"You have two options to choose from: to hire people who appear in the contract as contestants, and to say, 'Let's make a deal that's satisfactory and at a good price.'
“But the main idea is that it is not the price that matters, but the competence of people,” Laporte said.
This contract awarded to the Energy Management Consortium is part of a long list of more than <0x24>50,000 contracts received by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were concluded with Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After the verification, Le Devoir counted 109 engineering consulting contracts concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with companies or their branches, in particular with laboratories, to carry out soil sample analysis.
SNC-Lavalin has 22 contracts, of which Genivar has obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without having a share in "Energie gerance".
All contracts have been concluded.
They total <0x24>449,783,344, including a contract with Énergie gerance for <0x24>295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard indicated that the four companies that are part of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "very well-known of the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau said PQ was also linked to companies that "financed" her before clarifying that it was more of her managers.
Responsible consumption barometer - "green" label does not stimulate trust
More green, but openly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has very little confidence in the actors of sustainable development, but also in "impartial" brands and eco-certification, to be guided accordingly in product selection.
The worst thing is that even if we bathe in a media universe that urges us and urges more socially responsible consumption, this media universe complains about the lack of credible information, the failure to fulfil obligations, which it qualifies even as a brake on its constipation, a restraint on its constipation, a breakdown of its fate.
Although the consumption of so-called socially responsible products increased in 2010, the inhabitants of Quebec, who are trying to sell them, still do not trust them too much.
Two-thirds of us actually say they don’t believe the promises of companies regarding the environment, simply because green advertising by companies is finding a measuring tool developed by the University’s Responsible Consumption Observatory in Sherbrooke.
Other findings: Half of consumers doubt the credibility of official certificates attached to so-called fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands that are labelled as environmentally responsible, Barometer says.
Similarly, the discussion of politicians on this subject is taken as serious by only 14.6% of the population of Quebec.
Responsible consumption information, however, appears to be the primary stimulus for this page of consumption revived by almost a third of Quebec consumers at present.
Indeed, the vacuum and the dubious nature of the information would mitigate the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by Barometer, at a higher price for these products.
By the way, a third of the population of Quebec is untrustworthy about the information about the products or “green” services we are looking for to let them go through our hands.
On the other hand, in 2010, almost half of consumers were willing to change their habits and, in particular, to change the label of one or more products, thereby responding to their beliefs.
61% of them preferred shopping with shoppers in their neighborhood and preferred buying foods grown in their region, according to Baromètre.
More "green" and responsible - the index of responsible consumption has reached 64 of the maximum 100 for this year - , Homo consumus Quebec likes to present itself as a recycling king who strives to have as little environmental impact as possible by caring for animal protection.
But their social and ecological conscience obviously remained somewhere outside their car, Barometer says: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers said they were using public transport or recommending the use of a car to drive at least two people, in the interest of protection.
Walking and cycling also supported 39.1% of participants in this extensive behavioral survey who used this cliché.
State loan for the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex
The Government of Quebec, to which we have requested financial participation in the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex of Angus et le Parallèle, agrees to participate, but only to the loan amount.
The development company Angus et le Parallèle, which sought a <0x24>7 million donation from the Minister of Culture for the purchase of a cinematic complex on Boulevard Saint-Laurent and which proved its mission as a lover of film art, did not get what it demanded.
The government accepts the fact that it will be included in the documentation, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected gift, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan, which, by the way, would be lower, some of which were the original expectations, which could lay the foundation for viable solutions under favorable conditions and resources from the state.
The first action plan and demand of 12.8 million were already rejected by Quebec last spring, but applications have already been revised for a reduction.
The proposal and action plan was sent to Minister St-Pierre, President of the Society for the Development of Business in Culture (SODEC), François Macerola, who manages the cinematographic project eXcentris.
The final report was sent ten days ago.
But a counter-government proposal came to SODEC on Tuesday.
Le Parallèle et Angus have until 31 December to respond.
However, it seems that the hypothesis of the gift from the state must really be rejected.
Recall that the Association of Owners of Cinemas and Cinematographic Centres in Quebec was against the direct investment of the state in order to support the acquisition of eXcentris, assuming that the Minister of Culture should not finance a project related to real estate if he did not do so for other cinemas.
But a few of the participants in the discussion, on the contrary, demanded substantial economic support.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, got into his cinemas within ten years of film art after he himself funded the construction of the complex, which could have been a reason for change by the state's financial board.
The lack of independent film halls is sparkling in Montreal, and eXcentris has been able to get a permanent client.
Angus et le Parallèle, led by Christian Yaccarini, is conducting a campaign to release funds to the private sector, in the belief that it will cost <0x24>700,000 to suppress the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, Le Parallèle, one of three film companies, has continued to distribute films for eXcentris.
The goal of future buyers is to reopen all three halls on February 27th next year and showcase the most beautiful film by Xavier Beauvois, The Men and the Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not remember Le Devoir and thus ignores himself, he and his group think about the proposals for a reduction that are made to him.
Rising tyres in Canada as a whole...
The new U.S. diplomatic sources announced via WikiLeaks reveal what the U.S. considers a complex of Canadians’ minority toward Americans, but with the same blow they express their sense of superiority toward Canada.
The U.S. diplomat is therefore surprised that every Canadian voter is at the heart of Canadian-American relations when he goes to vote, and believes that President Obama’s visit has helped the conservative government to adopt its 2009 budget!
Four new reports, including the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, posted to the public yesterday, provide sensitive details to get each other "under the skin".
The September 22, 2008 communication, in the middle of the election campaign, details at what point the United States is not part of the stakes discussed by political leaders.
To the great admiration of the U.S. Ambassador to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins provides some explanations for this situation.
“The Canadian minority complex, almost excellent, requires perhaps political leaders to talk about internal bets, rather than realizing that these elections also apply to the United States (as in the 1988 Free Trade Campaign),” he writes.
"The United States, therefore," he concluded, "is a proverbial elephant in these elections: omnipresent, but potentially too dangerous to talk about."
The ambassador understands this "depressing silence" less that the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
“It is logical that the ability of a candidate, a party or even better, a party leader to manage these important relationships should be a key factor that voters have in mind when they go to elections.”
Another expression of this sense of importance can be read in the report sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, chargé d'affaires in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your path will help ensure the government's preservation in early February's confidence vote on the federal budget, which Canada will publicly acknowledge its first deficit in more than a decade, due to a <0x24>30-40 billion recovery plan."
No mention is made of the fact that the government had to postpone Parliament’s pre-Christmas session so as not to be defeated by the coalition and that opposition parties are conditioning their survival with the quality of the proposed restoration plan.
Another January 2008 report, signed by Ambassador Wilkins, highlights Washington’s increasingly negative image of the drama series aired on CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about broadcasting Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence, and H2O, in which it is possible to observe not too funny references to Maher Arar, "No-Fly-List" or also to kidnappings for violent CIA interrogations.
Another report reports that at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French partner, Bernard Kouchner, whether Europe was ready to accept some prisoners from Guantánamo.
Mr. Kouchner answered yes, but based on the "case by case" principle.
At the end of the meeting, it says, "there was some paper on Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian descent, to the secretary of state."
"The secretary accepted by revising the file."
Finally, let’s note that the people affected by WikiLeaks are sweating.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC that the person responsible for the massive escape should be “destroyed.”
Mike Huckabee, in the United States, heard about it.
The World Plan for the Restoration of Lighting
The United Nations in Cancun yesterday proposed a plan to restore domestic lighting, stores and industrial spaces in 100 countries to achieve greenhouse effect limitations (GES), which corresponds to almost one-third of the additional limits that need to be reached for the stabilization of the planet by 2020.
This ambitious plan is at the stage of major concrete projects that the United Nations wants to implement in Cancún to compensate for the absence of hard-to-reach commitments on the part of industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs that monopolize 50 to 70% of the market were to be replaced by fluorescent bulbs or, better yet, electroluminescent LED bulbs (DEL or "LED" in English), they would be essentially 1 billionth of the planet's G8.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of the world’s emissions.
That’s equivalent to 70% of the world’s fleet emissions.
In Copenhagen last year, large countries with significant shares in emissions such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, were involved in voluntary plans to reduce global GES emissions from 53 GT to 49 GT.
But another 5 Gt will need to be deducted from this balance sheet to achieve a stabilization of warming at 2 degrees Celsius by 2020 so that it can be ruled out of control.
In incandescent bulbs 95% of the energy is dispersed in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, is the product of light.
With fluorescent light bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75%, and with new DEL light bulbs, we reduce this consumption twice.
Fluocompact bulbs can last an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new DEL bulbs, which Philips announced this week in production - the company allegedly participated in a UN study - have an estimated lifespan of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a burned-out bulb, which gives us an idea of a 100-year-old plant.
All these new bulbs can also work with reostats and emit less heat.
They do not contain any mercury.
Several experts have expressed reservations to fluorescent light bulbs because they contain mercury and they need to be classified as hazardous waste, which is still not possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers set up collectibles.
However, as the report notes, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not a fluorescent bulb, but rather a thermal coal power plant, which releases much of the mercury needed to produce electricity wasted in the incinerated bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants put 25,000 tons of mercury into circulation each year.
The report also outlines in detail the profits that each country would make from this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save <0x24>1 billion a year on electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, which is equivalent to 3.5 thermal power plants, the construction of which would cost 2.5 billion.
The elephant coast is eagerly awaiting the results of the election.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the immediate publication of the results of the presidential election in Côte d'Ivoire after the deadlines have expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for an independent election commission to complete its work and to immediately announce the preliminary results," the UN spokesman said.
"It calls on all parties in Côte d'Ivoire and institutions to prove their sense of responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressures developed by some foreign governments, the election commission allowed the lowest date to pass - Wednesday midnight - without publishing the results, three days after Sunday's screening.
About forty minutes before the end of the deadline, the president of the CEI confirmed on television that the commission was "continuing to work" in order to announce the results.
On Wednesday, there were calls around the world for the CEI to finally announce the name of the winner of the second round, between retired Laurent Gbagbo and opposition member Alassane Ouattara.
But Gbagbo camp relies on the cancellation by the Constitutional Council for the "underground" vote in the north, which has been run by former New Army (FN) insurgents since the unsuccessful coup d'état in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the presidential election campaign in Côte d'Ivoire, confirmed that maneuvers of intimidation of voters practiced by the UN (New Army) in the north of the country have deterred the supporters of the president of Côte d'Ivoire from going to vote.
Elections could be cancelled if the Constitutional Council takes into account the complaints made by Gbagbo.
However, President Gbagbo’s opponents believe that the country’s Supreme Court is not neutral because it is led by Paul Yao N’Dré, a very close political ally of President Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who demented any connection with former insurgents, condemned the delay in announcing the results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but did not go so far as to demand victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he has suffered a loss, and that filing a complaint to the Constitutional Council after he prevented the election commission from transmitting the results would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential election, which took place on Sunday, was seen as the coronation of the process of reunification and reconciliation of the country, which has been divided into two halves for years.
The United Nations has warned a political faction of Côte d’Ivoire on Wednesday that it could be held responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo ended in the first round on 31 October, as a winner with 38% of the votes versus 32% for Alassan Ouattara, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rates remain stable in France in the third quarter of the year.
The unemployment rate in France in terms of the word according to the International Labour Office (ILO) remained stable at 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7% including overseas areas), as shown by the provisional figures with seasonal deviation corrections (INSE) in the CVS.
The number of unemployed has risen to 2,631 million in the metropolis.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed for 9.3% of the active population in the metropolis and 9.7% including overseas areas.
Within one year, the unemployment rate increases by 0.1 points.
In a broader survey, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France are not working in the third quarter, but would like to work, whether they are available or not in two weeks to work, and whether they are looking for or not.
The current situation of young people in the labour market has escalated further with a new increase in unemployment rate of 24.2% in metropolitan France (<0x2B> 0.9 points in three months, <0x2B> 0.5 points in one year) and 25% including overseas areas.
In the third quarter, according to the International Labour Office, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were out of work.
In terms of seniors, those in metropolitan France experienced a slight increase in unemployment to 6.4% in metropolitan France (<0x2B>0.2 points in three months, as well as in a year), that is 482,000 people from 50 years of age and 6.6% including overseas areas.
Only the population aged 25-49 had an unemployment benefit of 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 points in three months, <0x2B>0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% in the whole of France.
Insee no longer publishes the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, after a controversy over its calculation method.
Eurostat, the European Union's statistical agency, on the other hand, continues to produce monthly statistics and on Tuesday announced a 9.8% rate for France (including the DOM) in October after it was 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini is accused and imprisoned
Alexandre Guérini, 53, one of the head of the waste treatment company and brother of the Bouches-du-Rhône Board of Directors, was charged and imprisoned in a prison in Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, in the context of an investigation into a case in the public domain.
Alexandre Guérini has been accused of misuse of the company's assets, misuse of public funds and public property, concealment, payment of remuneration, receipt of remuneration for the purpose of influencing the office and possession of ammunition, his lawyer says.
"Alexandre Guérini is a warrior and insists that the judge explain to him all the questions he intends to ask, and not any confusion."
"It's easy to prosecute him for many criminal reasons, but the other thing is to prove them," his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP.
Mr. Guérini said through his lawyers that he had sent the judges a brief statement before his hearing to explain everything.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and imprisoned on Wednesday night.
According to his lawyer, Lucien Simon, his client never did anything other than to ensure the operation of the landfills he was supposed to manage.
With regard to the award of contracts or the destination of funds associated with their operation, he never knew anything like that, Simon said.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the Aubagne agglomeration services, was accused Wednesday of abusing public funds and conspiracy, and released, under judicial supervision, the protagonists of the whole matter.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts that have been pointed out to him."
“The investigating judge will look into it and let it go,” his lawyer, Yann Arnoux, said.
Four more people were charged and released on the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, with two of them under judicial supervision, state prosecutor Michel Raffin said.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director General with Elegance Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for accepting fees to influence the office and for passive corruption.
Two officials from the agglomeration of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are charged, one for "distorting and misusing the property of the company", the other for "conspiracy to misuse public funds".
Finally, Alexandre Guérini's business partner, Jeannie Peretti, was accused of "disgusting the company's assets".
Among the people confronted with Mr Guérin is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently charged with a concurrent case of fraudulent public procurement relating to Corsica.
Investigators suspect his companies have been helping to launder money from large-scale gangsters.
The investigation is carried out in the framework of several open judicial investigations against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous letters concerning alleged fraud in the conclusion of public procurement, in particular in the case of waste.
From a source of close investigation, the search focuses in particular on the conditions of assignment and operation of the landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne, as well as from some cities from the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss Case: Elysees Palace Exceeds Mediation in Syria
During more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, Klotilda Reiss, a young researcher detained in Iran for "spionage", unified opinions in France, introduced diplomacy into combat preparedness and emphasized Tehran's emphasis.
All of this was closely monitored by U.S. diplomats.
U.S. documents received through WikiLeaks and consulted with Le Monde reveal some of the disadvantages of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysian Palace explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to advise them on how to deal with such cases of hostages in Iran (a small group of travelers).
They show how French leaders tried to convince Washington that the release of a young French woman was not a compensation against the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian imprisoned in France and sought by the U.S. judiciary for undercover material trading.
Finally, they shed a sharp light on how the French presidency tried to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad played a central role in the liberation of Klotilda Reiss.
Actually, he didn't do anything for it.
The diplomatic telegram, written in Paris on 12 August 2009, is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to deal with hostages".
The Elysée Palace’s Adviser for Strategic Affairs, François Richier, accompanied by Quai d’Orsay’s Director for North Africa’s Middle East, Patrice Paoli, speaks with the representative of U.S. diplomacy Allegrone.
They explain the French method to him.
They advise Americans to do the same in order to be transported back to the homeland of their own nationals by violence detained in Iran.
"Make noise," they say, "continually pronounce the words "fundamental human rights", "innocence", "immediate release" in the media.
It is necessary to bring into being an uncomplicated Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
“Do it as much as they ask you to stop doing it.”
Since attempts to negotiate through discrete channels have taken place, "quietly it will not solve anything", the Iranians are "myths of avoidable maneuvers".
Richier recalls that the arrest of foreigners is "an Iranian family tactic: taking hostages for "political extortion".
He announces that the release of Klotilda Reiss (which will take place on August 16, the day she is granted asylum by the French embassy) "requires the payment of a high financial sum to the Iranians" (a bail of 230,000 euros).
The Elysian Palace is anticipating hostage cases, a phenomenon that "will exacerbate".
"In the future, the Iranians could arrest some 1,800 more French people living in Iran," he said.
August 28, 2009.
Klotilda Reiss left prison 12 days ago, but is still locked up in Iran.
Iran’s Majid Kakavand, whom the United States declares to have been expelled for illegal trafficking in sensitive electronic material in relation to Iran, is released in Paris on the basis of a judge’s decision.
The U.S. Embassy, like many observers, is questioning this disturbing consensus.
For Washington, which is pursuing illegal Iranian networks to obtain material for its nuclear program, the expansion of Majid Khakavanda is bad news.
Did France agree to the treaty?
The liberation of Iran for the liberation of a young French woman?
In a further interview with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée Palace, he said, was not only “shocked by this judge’s decision,” but was looking for a way to stand up against it.
"There have been talks between the presidential office and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the court's decision," he notes.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is under the “limited” supervision of the French intelligence service.
“The Elysees Palace adviser slaps the phone number, hangs the headphone, and then informs the U.S. diplomat that the Iranian is currently in the Paris buildings managed by the Iranian embassy.”
At the time of Klotilda Reiss's imprisonment in Iran, the Elysée Palace is developing efforts, negotiating, through communication and organized "fugitives" in the media to convince Syrian President Bachar al-Assad plays a "significant" and "influential" role.
Americans observe this activity not without irony and find that manipulation bears its fruit, as several articles in the press reflect the French official version.
Telegram of August 25, 2009 evokes the media's "blessing" of French officials.
On what is based such a measure of "thankfulness" expressed to Assad, the embassy in Paris is asked.
"Despite their statements full of praise, French officials in private acknowledge that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians actually did."
The document then deals with the reasons that forced the Elysian Palace to pay in this fiction.
Intensive communication “is aimed at validating President Sarkozy’s policy of opening up to Syria,” he analyses.
The policy implemented in 2008 "was observed by many critical voices in France and abroad and labeled as premature and unmerited".
By “exaggerating the Syrian role,” Paris is trying to “demonstrate to Syria what praises it can deserve when it plays a constructive role in the region.”
It is also aimed at “scattering the seeds of conflict between Syria and Iran.”
The U.S. Embassy knows this from a very good source.
On August 11, François Richier confided to him: "Of course, we do not know whether the Syrians have done anything, whatever it is."
"But we thanked them anyway."
“This should at least bring confusion and confusion among the Iranians.”
Klotilda Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy welcomes her in the Palace of Elysée.
He thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the liberation of our country".
End of online games after midnight for young Koreans
The South Korean government will pass a law called "Peciválsk<0xC3><0xBD>", which will ban teenagers from playing online games after midnight, by blocking access to them, officials said.
The bill will be presented to Parliament in December in order to request companies operating online games to block access to these games after midnight for persons under the age of 16, officials of the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of the Family said.
"Many children play these games all night and then have trouble learning at school and are unable to lead a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," Jo Rin, the minister's deputy chairman, told AFP.
Online games will be re-accessible from 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the implementation of the law, he said.
The government also assumes that it will ask companies to limit the daily time of access to these games for young people whose parents request it, the responsible worker added.
It also provides free programs for people who request it, allowing them to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the countries most “disabled” and the daily press regularly brings various facts related to the intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also an undisputed champion in world competitions in online games.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, facing 58 other nations.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA sets up host countries.
Fifa’s executive committee on Thursday sets up the host country of the 2018 and 2022 World Cup, a predominantly politically motivated selection where the struggle for influence and lobbying risk going ahead of the technical criteria.
The thing is for sure, the FIFA Royal Competition in 2018 will be held in Europe, the traditional bastion of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The championship in 2022 will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping to win new territories (Qatar, Australia) after its premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its implantation in the United States or the Far South.
The list of persons participating in the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince of Qatar, the heads of governments of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the opportunity to create a political stance on the world economy.
Negotiations in the backyard face the risk that they will last up to the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to determine the hierarchy according to the candidates.
According to the FIFA assessment report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) documentation contains the best arguments, as well as the documentation of their competitors.
But these reasons will not have too much weight for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the hour of voting.
The Sunday Times, at the beginning of a revelation that led to the suspension of two members of the EC/European Commission for Corruption (Reynald Temarii et Amos Adamu) may have ruined the chances of their country, the digging beds that have so far hosted the world championship only once a year.
The BBC on Monday put the crown on it when it aired a document that was "squeezed on the pavement" by three influential members of the CE (European Commission?), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
How to make FIFA dissatisfied and bring into discomfort the English leading actor with David Cameron in the first place.
The Prime Minister hopes he will be able to repeat the move that his predecessor, Tony Blair, succeeded in winning for the 2012 London Olympics in 2005.
Will this intensive activity be enough to give England a new shine to its name at the CE (European Commission?)?
Nothing is less certain, as the Spain-Portugal pair lacks the trumpets of the already-prepared stadiums, its well-wishing (World Championships in Spain 1982, 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the cloudy economic and financial perspectives of both countries could give these ambitious cold showers.
Possible retaliation against the British and doubts about the eligibility of Spain and Portugal only increase the position of Russia, which was an outsider despite the gaps in its documentation (stadions, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided that the championship would not be moved to Curitiba and publicly declared "lack of competition in the preparation of the vote" in word strikes barely followed by accusations of the English press against the members of the European Commission.
“We’ll throw them in the trash, we’ll try to compromise them,” Putin said.
For 2022, the United States seems to be a logical favorite with its significant 1994 experience.
The world’s highest economic performance, the headquarters of FIFA’s main sponsors, seems to have made a big leap ahead of Japan and South Korea, which, separately, prepared a beautiful project.
But these nominations appear to be premature for both countries, which together underwent a "test" in 2002.
Another threat: China's 2026 World Cup award, which is desperately desired by FIFA, has rendered the Asian chances for 2022 invalid.
With Qatar pulling out of the sleeve of a large ace in the form of futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion to new countries, but these two countries pose more risks than certainty.
Australia, as well as Japan and Korea, could complain about the flat-rate TV fees (due to the time shift) paid by European countries, forming a driving force for FIFA.
Second mandate: clarity (security)
De Gaulle really weighed.
Mitterrand thought he was hesitant.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not dare in the slightest.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than them.
The mandate of the Elysée Palace is calling someone else.
The current head of state will be a candidate in 2012.
But obviously it's not in good harmony with the share of the secrets associated with the presidency.
It is therefore necessary to act as if the doubts persisted.
In one sense and in the other.
In 2006, the friends of Jacques Chirac claimed that the third mandate would not be excluded.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy assured himself that he would "decide someday in the autumn of 2011".
As UMP MPs pointed out Wednesday evening at the Elysees Palace, the prospect of "two mandates" was a bit of a fever.
Was that the official announcement of his candidacy?
He wasn't far from it.
The President only recalled that the 2008 amendment to the Constitution limited the number of five-year term to two.
It was only a statement, not a notification.
It’s not the first time he’s been reminded of the humorous tone of the presidential election at such meetings.
“In the worst case, or at best, you have seven and a half years ahead of you with me,” he said in July 2009.
Rebelie in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the next stage."
His previous statements will not make him a candidate more than the day before; they will not make him a candidate less.
If they're making comments, it's because of the double truth.
Accelerate the path to the PS candidate, on the one hand.
But it's not the entrance to Ségolène Royal's pistol, which is pushing Nicolas Sarkozy to get it.
On the contrary, it is because his candidacy in 2012 is obvious that many in the PS want to be organized into combat teams rather than planned.
Bad research on the other side.
First, right-wing voters would prefer François Fillon’s candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy’s (46% vs. 44%, according to BVA-L’Express).
“We have a candidate and we are not discussing the matter with the UMP,” people from the prime minister’s immediate and cautious surroundings responded.
“If he believes in possible defeats, he will not run,” says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
“He’ll still believe he can win,” says Alain Juppé, who’s obviously equalized.
Euro: The European Central Bank is forced to continue its procurement of state securities.
The last meeting of the Central Governing Council in the year was to be an opportunity to clarify the conditions for the emergence of the crisis or, at least, to announce the cessation of a large number of unusual monetary policy operations, which must be terminated by the end of this year.
The crisis of European sovereign debt commits, the Securities Institute will undoubtedly not be able to afford to be so categorical under the threat of aggravation of the situation already so tense in the European securities markets.
In that case, the political price would be much higher.
Yesterday, on the occasion of a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde gave up the active role played by the European Central Bank in solving the debt crisis of European states.
She didn’t want to say if she thought the bank could do more, for example, by increasing their program of buying sovereign bonds.
"I express my gratitude to my European partners (...). "
The evening before, in Brussels, during his hearing of the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, the President of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not appear as more expressive as to his second intentions, and satisfied himself with the "screaming" of the "screaming" and the "screaming" of the programme.
The only certainty: The European Central Bank will keep its basic fixed interest rate at 1%, its historically lowest since May 2009.
In fact, the European Central Bank’s cash purchases have doubled to almost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.35 billion in the past week.
And thanks to the insensitiveness of contractors in the market yesterday made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds.
The Eurosystem’s central banks have bought a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>67 billion since May 2010.
There are no doubts between contractors on the market in anticipation of the continuation of purchases (see page 29).
Nor do economists expect any significant change in the course.
If the loan operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the Central Bank's arsenal, the latter shall accede to the unlimited provision of liquidity under generous terms and for a period of one week to three months.
Economists today expect this mechanism to be extended by a few months.
"I can't imagine she'd change her schedule in a significant way."
“If not, it would take the risk of triggering a short-term new tension,” said Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
“The progressive outlook announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely,” said Norbert Bräms, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
To plan its interventions in the public debt market, "the European Central Bank would have to keep the purchase volume of its bonds to revive the wet market," adds Norbert Bräms.
With regard to the exposure of European banks in euro area sovereign debt markets, there is no choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
“It needs to compensate for the shortage of investors in the market at all costs and to act in such a way as to prevent the rise of the paid performance of the state, which is among the most vulnerable,” said a senior bond administrator.
Because if interest rates fell, states would be more concerned about reducing their debt, rather than stabilizing it.
It’s the saving of the euro at this price.
In Italy, the government of Berlusconi backs
After the start of the week for Italy, the worrying situation has relaxed a bit, yesterday with a backward flow of compulsory interest rates to 10 years.
Return to Temporary Relaxation.
At the end of a meeting with the Minister of Economy of the Regions, they said they heard Giulio Tremonti calling the situation "unresolved" and that he expects an "unpredictable" weekend, which he then demented.
In any case, on Tuesday, the deviation from the long German interest rate reached a record 210 basic points and the price of bankruptcy protection contracts (CDS) flew up to 263 points, causing some disruption in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain the deviation from German interest rates was higher than 400 basis points.
But his right hand, Gianni Letta, has declared himself "too busy" with the "turnful development of markets" and a possible infection originating in Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the eurozone’s third economy, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that it’s like Portugal,” explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly and unencryptedly, its problem is the lack of growth and subtle fiscal inputs, which goes hand in hand and exposes the state to the risk that it will not be able to cover its financing needs.
The last forecasts of Brussels were a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget available to the Senate for its analysis is 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the public finance deficit will account for another 4.3% of gross domestic product next year (against 3.9% expected by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (rather than 2.7%).
Hence the reputation for a new summary of the supplements to the draft state budget, which could be introduced after the holidays, amounting to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7 billion.
"If necessary, new stringent measures will have to be taken," said Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
For the time being, Italy is receiving support from international institutions.
“The basics of its economy are fine and its calculations are correct, we have been repeating this for a long time,” said Arrigo Sadun, a member of the Italian Board of Directors of the International Monetary Fund under pressure from Italy on the International Monetary Fund.
“There is no immediate problem, either short-term or long-term, because despite its significant debt (119.2% of gross domestic product in 2011, the GDP), the stabilization effort required in Italy is less than the efforts required by the other countries, the OECD says.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face the motion for distrust in the House of Representatives and subsequently the elections, which are expected to be held at the end of March, could begin.
Such a period would begin, which is not suitable for decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans are considering strengthening the anti-crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde reiterated this yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "I think that the Europeans have demonstrated this throughout the day and night on Sunday, they are obviously very solidary, committed to defending their currency and their currency zone."
Although everything is relative, yesterday’s expansion in interest rates on European bonds brought water to the mills to governments and the Central European Bank.
But we can't talk about the beginning of normalization yet.
Standard & Poor's has announced that it could degrade the debt record of Portugal, the target most targeted by different speculations.
“Because in May, the real policy is insufficiently transparent and obvious, based mainly on banking systems,” says economist Exane BNP Paribas.
“Political time runs slower than market time.”
Aware of this disconnected context and the dangers that it hides, European countries are intensifying the discussion, aimed at strengthening existing crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between the finance ministers, the most affected by the problem, and on a broader scale with their counterparts from the G20, are developing very well.
This is in view of the Eurogroup meetings (Eurogroup) and the Ecofin Group since the beginning of next week.
The meeting of the European Central Bank is held today.
The programme is the fate of unconventional measures to support the euro area countries with a focus on markets (see above).
With regard to the European Fund for Finance (EFSI), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, set out on a trip to Asia in Singapore on Tuesday, in order to inform investors from the Far East about the development of the crisis in Europe.
If this is not the goal of raising funds, the insurer is thereby preparing the ground to achieve this goal.
The first issue of FESF securities is expected for next month.
Yesterday, a U.S. official told Reuters that the U.S. would support any increase in mobilized funds by additional direct involvement in the IMF.
The countries concerned in the first place, Portugal and Spain, are preparing for the adoption of structural reforms, in particular with regard to the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms that are linked to strict, fast-acting measures.
Lisbon and Madrid had a different route than Greece and Ireland.
At all costs, the two countries want to avoid applying for international assistance before applying their own budgetary adjustments and before deciding on the structural reforms necessary to regain their lasting trust.
The capital participants in the European Funds are finally talking about options available to accelerate the normalisation process of markets with sovereign bonds.
On his trip to Paris on November 24, Axel Weber came up with the idea that if the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>750 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to reach stockpiles again.
Economists from Barclays Capital, which is the very first player in the European sovereign debt trading plan, believe that the addition of about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion would be enough, "preferably" in the form of direct financial liquidity provision.
The fund exists: it is the European Financial Stability Mechanism, which has been donated <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion to date.
The Council, which has every chance of being tested in European capitals.
Especially when the market conditions are deteriorating.
Snow and ice: 24 regions have orange alertness.
Snow grants are still causing traffic problems, especially on second-class roads in Brittany, and there is a risk of disrupting some economic activity.
Twenty-four districts are now in orange condition due to the risk of snow and moisture.
L'Eure, l'Eure-et-Loir, les Deux-Sèvres and la Vienne have joined the 20 districts that already have an orange alert, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, later at night.
According to Meteo France, significant snowfall causes problems in the north of the Gironde and the Charentes and weak snow in Ile-de-France.
Snow cover from 2 to 5 cm, places from 7 to 10 cm, is expected in the affected districts and cover from 1 to 3 cm, places up to 5 in the Paris region.
The districts of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, du Poitou and the districts of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin are affected.
The snowfalls are large enough to cause traffic jams and disrupt some economic activity, Météo France predicts.
On the Côtes d'Armor coast, some districts banned heavy trucking - trucks over 7.5 tons with the route Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
Road traffic on second-class roads in Brittany is very difficult, according to the police, and the police recommends to go with their vehicle only when it is really necessary and the traffic of some trucks has been cancelled for this day.
In Picardia, school meetings were banned on Thursday.
No special measures to restrict freight transport are envisaged on Wednesday evenings.
The county office "urges all drivers of cars to be as cautious as possible on the roads and to adapt the driving nature of the road."
The General Directorate of Civil Aviation (DGAC) has asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at Paris Roissy Airport and 10% at Orly on Thursday due to expected snowfall.
The DGAC recommends that passengers using air transport services contact their company.
In the UK, Gatwick Airport in the south of London and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: the first financial proposals
Since the debate on the modernisation of transport in Ile-de-France is in full force, it has rained billions.
At least during the discussion.
We remember in particular 23 billion for the Grand Paris Metro, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order for the building to be launched, the state announced a grant of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4 billion.
Purely theoretically, this is the amount that will then allow SGP to use part of the financing from its double source for the contracts.
Today we are finally getting to the first additions.
The Financial Adjustment Act of 2010, which is being examined by the Finance Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the mechanisms set out to secure these funds.
There are two: creating a special tax on equipment and increasing taxes from offices in Ile-de-France.
First, let us read in the text of the bill, Article 15, reads "in favour of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
It is calculated: "The income from this interest is 117 million euros per year".
The second is the reconstruction of the office rate, which already exists for that reason, "to be modernised to increase the profits obtained from it and to make this increase affect the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would it cost?
Predator.
It is not numerated in the text.
Up to <0x24>4 billion is a long way off.
“It is clarified that these fiscal resources are joining the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4 billion of capital subsidies that will be mobilised by the state and invested in the Société du Grand Paris according to the project,” the statement reads.
At SGP, this system does not seem shocking to us.
“From the moment we created revenue (both taxes, ndlr), we can cover the study for three years and then roll up to <0x24>4 billion,” he explains here.
"It will be included in the budget and used as needed."
SGP expects <0x24>4 billion to be allocated to the 2014 budget until 2013.
This mechanism, in which the promised <0x24>4 billion belongs to still absent subscribers, risks sparking a somewhat tumultuous parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be held on 7 December.
Hackers and Causeless Scientists
The WikiLeaks case is of double importance.
On the one hand, there is revealed an obvious scandal, a scandal that seems to be just a scandal in the face of hypocrisy governed by relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it speaks of profound changes at the international level, and assumes a controlled regression of the future.
But let's make a deal.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks, this is a confirmation of the fact that every document compiled by a secret service (any nation) consists exclusively of press clippings.
The "Extraordinary Disclosure" of the Americans of the way Berlusconi's sexual life has been announced by what everyone has been able to read in any newspaper for months (all but these two Berlusconi's own), and the cartoon profile of Kadhafi's Kadhafi's has not been clear.
The rule that secret documents may consist only of reports already known is essential in the dynamics of secret services, not only in this century.
When you go to a bookstore dedicated to esoteric literature, you will see that each work repeats exactly what has been written in previous works (about the Graal, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Temples or the Temples).
Not only because the author of occult texts does not like to search for new information (he does not even know where to search for news of non-existent ones), but because those who are devoted to occultism believe only what they already know and what confirms what they have already learned.
That's the mechanism of Dana Brown's success.
The same goes for secret documents.
The informant is linear, and linear (or limited spirit) the head of the secret services (and if he is not, he could, as I know, be an editor in the newspaper Libération) who considers only what he himself admits to be true.
The high-secret information about Berlusconi, which the U.S. Embassy sent to the state resort, was the same as Newsweek published a week earlier.
Why, then, have there been so many changes to the disclosure of these documents?
On the one hand, they say what every cultivated person already knows, namely that the embassy, at least since the end of World War II, and since the heads of state can call or take off by plane for a joint dinner, they have lost their diplomatic role in the transformation and, in any case, the transformation of their own people.
Any spectator watching the film about the investigation knows very well that it is apparently ignored only by licensing.
However, the fact that this is repeated publicly haunts the duty of hypocrisy and sheds a bad light on American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can obtain the most strictly classified information of the most powerful country in the world is a hard blow, not unnoticed, for the prestige of this state resort.
The scandal affects both the victims and their "perpetrators".
But let's go from here to the deep truth of what happened.
Once upon a time, in the days of Orwell, it was possible to grasp all the power, like some Big Brother, who controlled every movement of his people.
Orvel’s prophecies have been proven since, thanks to the ability to control every movement through the phone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the used motorway, and so on, became a citizen of the absolute victim of the power cradle.
But when we demonstrate how it’s going now, that even the “secret tombs” with the most powerful information can’t resist a hacker’s intervention, the checking message stops being one-way and becomes a circulator.
Power is controlled by every citizen, but every citizen, or at least a hacker—chosen as a citizen’s avenger—can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power be kept that no longer has the ability to keep its own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel has already said that the true secret is the incomplete secret (and the incomplete secret will never be revealed); it is also true that all the information about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is incomplete; it is in fact the incomplete secret of life, the incomplete secret of all things, the incomplete secret of all things.
WikiLeaks didn’t make any mistakes with Sarkozy or Merkel, but it did something big for Clinton and Obama.
What will the consequences of this wound of spared power be so significant?
It is obvious that in the future, states will not be able to send sensitive information online - that would be equivalent to its publication on a poster stamped on the corner of the street.
But it’s also quite obvious that with current technologies, it’s unnecessary to hope that a message can be kept secret over the phone.
There is nothing easier than to find out if and when the head of state traveled by plane and connected with one of his colleagues.
How can private and sensitive messages be kept secret in the future?
I know well that for the moment my prognosis belongs to science-fiction and so it is fantastic, but I have to imagine government agents who carry discreetly fulfilling formalities on uncontrollable routes and carry with them only those messages that they know to memorize or rather hide under the cover of information.
The information will be stored in unique copies in key-closed drawers: overall, the Watergate spy attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now moving sideways forward, that is, backwards.
A century after wireless telegraph was a revolution in communications, the Internet rehabilitated wire-based (telephone) telegraph.
The video cassettes (analogs) allowed cinema lovers to film the film step by step, move it forward and forth, and reveal all the secrets of the assembly, while now CDs (digitals) only allow them to jump through chapters, i.e. macropores.
By high-speed trains we can get from Rome to Milan in three hours, while to travel by airplane and transport that includes we need three and a half hours.
It is not surprising, therefore, that politics and communication techniques will return to cars pulled by horses.
The last note.
At other times, the press tried to understand what was happening in the embassy's secret.
Now it is the embassies that request confidential information from the press.
Climate: How France hacked its funding promises
A year after the Copenhagen Accord, it is time to try to keep the pledges of fast-start (fast-start) or premature financing made by developed countries.
And great French hacks have been revealed
In the Copenhagen Agreement, the developed countries pledged to provide <0x24>30 billion in 2010-2012.
The European Union has pledged <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion for three years and France <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.26 billion (that is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>420 million annually).
At the start of COP16, the EU drew a great deal of attention to convincing its partners about the reality of its commitment to financing fast start: a report clarifying the action of its Member States, a press conference, a grand side event, the distribution of brochures...
Transparent operations are invaluable and valued at their true value: the developed countries and civil society would like all the developed countries and civil society to do them the same and with the same precision.
The EU announces that it has released <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion in 2010, leading it on the right track to keep its promise of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we focus on detail, we find that things are much more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Agreement, these funds are "new and additional" to ensure that the increased burden is realized without detrimental to the Public Aid for Development.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and extra" means.
While the European Commission has proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the process.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that best suits them.
For example, the European Commission considered 2009 as a reference: international funding has been maintained and it is still adding 150 million to it for three years of fast-start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references with annual payment deadlines or with dates at the level of public development aid.
France, on the other hand, considers that funding for "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to expenditure in previous periods or to the global level of Public Aid for Development (PdA).
In particular, the total amount of France’s support for developing countries may remain unchanged (or even decreased) and must comply with its commitment to finance “new and additional”...
Another decisive element is the division into gifts and loans.
There is no rule yet and everyone chooses their own method of calculation.
Some, such as France, think that 1 <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> borrowed is equal to 1 <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> donated.
Obviously, this is hard to prove: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be proved for some investments that are profitable (often projects associated with emission reduction, based on more efficient technologies), it is foolish to present one euro, which we get, as the equivalent of a dollar, but the euro, which we give, is not the equivalent of a dollar, but it should not be the same as a dollar.
But France can only make such a justification: it "complies" with its commitment of 420 million euros, of which it makes 91.5% of the loan (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of the donations (36.1 million euros) - see the EU document so that you can verify it yourself.
It is the only country in the Union that uses a loan on such a scale.
Germany claimed 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among other things) comply with their commitments to 100% donations.
In other words, if the absolute majority of the European Union gives <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1 to fulfill its promise, France will only give 10 cents and consider this effort comparable.
A lovely piece of cake!
To sum up, in its financing "fast start", France operates with two sheiks: on the one hand with the development of shares in time and on the other with real financial burden.
Although it only spends 36.1 million euros, it is able to convince it to spend 420 million euros "new and extra" in connection with its promises.
The manipulation of the finance minister (because it seems that although it is Bercy who made this decision) could have a double negative impact, at the same time within the EU (why would Member States continue to donate when it is enough to borrow?) and in negotiations, because the developments are on the rise...
The chapter on premature funding is only a small, relatively short-term question in relation to a series of climate discussions.
But it could also be a grain of sand in a huge machine like UNFCCC.
Let's hope this isn't our case.
Whatever it is, it is necessary to draw on the lessons from this first year of pre-financing.
First, France should notify a change in its way of keeping the accounts for 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and fairness and justice towards the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France should avoid the discussion of long-term financing deposits (another key chapter currently discussed): we will not avoid the question of "additionality" or the way loans are made.
France should change its stance to become as progressive in these deposits as in the case of others.
The hope, therefore, is for all to be invested in the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will come to Cancun next week.
The surprising announcement of France’s fast start and its vision of “additionality” and borrowing could trigger an increase in the level of international trust needed to move forward in the discussions.
An alarm about pesticides that children will see.
A 10-year-old child will one day eat 81 different chemicals, according to a study published this Wednesday, from the Future Generations Association (ex- Movement for the Rights and Preservation of Future Generations).
The association, which notes that its results "do not have significant statistical value given the low number of samples analyzed, but are characteristic of the processed problem", bought between July and July supermarkets of light and light-eating foods commonly consumed in a single meal as a single meal.
These typical foods, including official recommendations - five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water a day - as well as sugars, have been analyzed by research laboratories on chemicals, pesticides and other pesticides, including coke products.
The balance of the plate is striking: 81 chemicals, of which 42 rank among carcinogenic substances, possible or likely, and five substances are among clear carcinogenic substances, as well as 37 substances that could act as a peeling agent for pesticides, such as intestines.
"While in almost all cases the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, we can see well in our research that the reality of consumer exposure to contaminants, possibly carcinogenic, and/or PE, is contagious," the association said.
Breakfast butter and milk tea contain about ten residues with potential carcinogenic effects and three proven to be certain carcinogenic ones, as well as about twenty residues that could disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, mentioned in the study as a small snack, contains traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to green beans from Kenya, included in lunch, in which the study found traces of strong insecticides banned in the EU.
In addition, boiled meat stews, tuna in cans and even slugs and chewing gums were sprayed with pesticides and other chemicals.
The analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform in the water from the hose.
The salmon steak for dinner was the "richest" with 34 chemical residues discovered and even the analysis of the plastic plate used to heat the food in the microwave oven did not avoid the analysis.
The final risk for consumers of this "cocktail of contaminants" is likely underestimated, according to the study.
The Ecological Europe-Greens Association (EE-LV) has proposed to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop “the rise of civilizational diseases”.
In July, the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) examined the status of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
