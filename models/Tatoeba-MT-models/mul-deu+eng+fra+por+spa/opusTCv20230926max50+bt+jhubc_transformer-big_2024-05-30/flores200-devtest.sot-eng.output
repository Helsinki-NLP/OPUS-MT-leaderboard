Merung makes it difficult for a primate with a dietary system such as humans to find its needs for amino acids to many plants available.

Plants that are very easily found will be proteins found in magazines and foods such as cigarettes and cigarettes, but it is difficult for primates such as us to eat them if they are not cooked.
In contrast, not only do animal foods (beasts, insects, cows) easily digest the stomach, but they contain a lot of proteins that contain all the necessary amino acids.
After looking at everything, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved the "protein problems" they had in a way that is similar to what the scientists are doing today.
