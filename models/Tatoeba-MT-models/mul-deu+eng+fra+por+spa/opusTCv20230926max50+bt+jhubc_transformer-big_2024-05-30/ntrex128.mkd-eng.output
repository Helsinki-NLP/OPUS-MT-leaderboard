Members of the Welsh People's Assembly are concerned that they "look like maplets"
Some of the Members of the Assembly are surprised by the proposal to change their name to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This stems from plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly from all over the political spectrum are concerned that this could be the subject of ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party said his party was concerned that it was “running with Twp and Pwp.”
For those who don’t speak Welsh: in Welsh, twp means “mad” and pwp means “how”.
A member of Plaid said the party as a whole was "unhappy" and proposed alternatives.
A member of the Conservative Party said his party was "free-spirited" about the name change, but noted that the similarity of the words "MWP" and "mappet" was large.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similar to the Yorkshire-English pronunciation of the letter "u".
The National Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing a law to introduce the name changes, stated: "The final decision on any words by which the members of the Assembly will be appointed, of course, will be taken by the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the commission published the results of public consultations on the proposals that indicated strong support for the nomination of the Assembly as the Welsh Parliament.
On the issue of the name of the Members of the Assembly, the Commission prefers Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option receives the greatest support from public consultations.
MEPs are proposing alternative options, but the struggle to reach a consensus could cause headaches for House President Elaine Jones, who is expected to submit a bill on the changes within a few weeks.
The Reform Act will include other changes to the way the Assembly works, including rules on disqualification of members of the Assembly and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will give the final vote on the question of their name when discussing the law.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum to change the country’s name.
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was put in an attempt to resolve the decade-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents the enactment of law on its territory and has consistently opposed the country's attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, an opponent of the name-change plebiscite, said he would not take the vote into account.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bell has been squeezed as churches in Harlem face problems
“Historically, the old people I was talking to say that at every corner there was a bar and a church,” Mr. Adams said.
“Today, there is neither one nor the other.”
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“People are socializing differently today,” he said.
“The bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhoods where people go regularly.”
And for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of the property will not last as long as the leaders think, “and sooner or later, it will return to the same place from which it began.”
Churches, he added, can be replaced with residential buildings full of types of people who will not help the remaining shrines in the neighborhood.
“Most of the people who buy homes in those buildings are white,” he said, “and that is why it will accelerate the day when these churches will be completely closed because it is unlikely that most of the people who enter those apartments will be in those apartments.”
The two churches were built by congregations of whites before Harlem became the metropolis of blacks – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin a decade later.
The original congregation of white Methodists was relocated in the 1930s.
The Congregation of Blacks who practice their faith in the vicinity takes ownership of the building.
St. Martin was taken over by the Congregation of Blacks during the reign of priest John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of sellers on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street, who refused to hire or promote blacks.
The building was severely damaged by a fire in 1939, but since the members of the parish of Johnson's father had plans to rebuild it, they bought the carillon.
Priest David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly called the carillon “the bell of the poor.”
The expert who played the carillon in July called it differently: "cultural wealth" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carylon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carylon in the Church of Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriver said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What has happened in St. Martin in the last few months is a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, a part brought by the unskilled church leaders, and a part of the episcopal diocese.
The church board – the governing body of the church, made up of unskilled leaders – wrote to the diocese in July with concern that the diocese “will require the costs to be transferred” to the church board, although the parish council did not include the ecclesiastical council in its work.
Some members of the parish have complained of a lack of transparency by the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old Child While Scuba diving in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while scuba diving in California on the opening day of the scuba season, authorities said.
The attack happened about 7 a.m. near Biconi Beach in Ensinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB in San Diego that he had scuba diving with friends about an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then sent to the group to help get him out of the water.
Hamel stated that he first thought it was the excitement of catching a shrimp, but then “then he realized that he was screaming, ‘It’s too late!
You touched me!”
The whole key bone was looking at him,” Hamel said that he noticed after reaching the boy.
“I called everyone out of the water, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Radi Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was taken as a critical condition.
It is not known what species the shark was responsible for the attack.
The rescuer at the beach, Captain Larry Gils, said at a news conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but decided that the shark was not of a dangerous species.
Gils added that the victim had been traumatized to the top of the torso.
Authorities have closed the beach from the beach side of Ponto in Casablanca to Swami in Ensinitas for 48 hours on grounds of investigation and security.
Gils noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK's beauty market
Sainsbury's takes over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty shelves in the style of department stores full of professional assistants.
As part of the significant entry into the UK beauty market, which weighs 2.8 billion pounds, which continues to grow as sales in the fashion and household sector drops, the large shelves will be tested in 11 stores every year.
The investment in beauty emerged after supermarkets began looking for ways to exploit the space on shelves that was once intended for TVs, microwaves and household appliances.
Sainsbury's said for the first time that it will double its beauty product offering to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing brands L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also gain more space with branded areas similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket also re-launches its makeup series Boutique, so that most of the products are suitable for vegans, something that is increasingly in demand from younger consumers.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two stores at Sainsbury, the first of which opened in Craydon, South London, last week, and the second opened in Sely Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the tendency to buy smaller amounts of food on a daily basis in local stores means that supermarkets need to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coop, director of Sainsbury's, said stores will increasingly look like grocery stores as the chain of supermarkets is trying to fight off Aldi and Lidl discounts with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's began to place stores at Argos in hundreds of stores, and also introduced numerous Habitat stores after buying both chains two years ago, which, according to them, increased grocery sales and made purchases more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to reorganize its beauty and pharmacy departments was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots shortly after 2000, but the collaboration ended after disagreement over how to divide profits from chemical stores in supermarkets.
The new strategy emerged after Sainsbury's sold 281 of its pharmacy stores to Celesio, the owner of the chain Lloyds Pharmacy, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
It was said that Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding a series of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Chief Commercial Officer, said: “We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty shelves to improve the environment for our consumers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit every need, and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a compulsory beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'sad' after Holly Willoughby retired from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million contract
Star Peter Jones from Dragons Den has gone “razy” after TV host Holly Willoughby resigned from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his branded lifestyle business to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willowby doesn’t have time for their brand Truely for household products and accessories.
The couple's business is linked to the Goop brand by Gwinnett Paltrow.
This 37-year-old programmer said on Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby left Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, retreating from their lucrative branded lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her new major contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "raged" when the television girl admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts — worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million — were worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1 million — mean that she was not ready for a product.
The business is linked to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand, and it was said that it would double Willowby's fortune by an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
As 37-year-old Willoughby said on Instagram that he was leaving True, Jones quickly left the UK in one of his weekends.
A source said: “Truly has always been at the top of Holly’s priorities.
It was supposed to be her long-term future that she would follow in the next two decades.
Her decision to retreat all those affected caught them absolutely unprepared.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to the opening.
Marlow’s headquarters has a warehouse full of products ready for sale.”
Experts believe that leaving this morning's program guide, which is one of the UK's most paid stars, could cost the company millions due to large investments in pillows and candlesticks, to clothes and household products, and for the sake of more weight.
It can also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Cape for ten years.
Willoughby founded True with Cape in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined them as president in March.
The couple go on vacation together and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin’s television production company.
Willoughby is set to become the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Antoine McPartlin as I'm a Celebrity's ITV director.
A source close to Jones said yesterday, “We are not commenting on his business achievements.”
A serious conversation "and then we fell in love"
He was joking about the criticism he would receive from the media for commenting on what some would consider "non-presidential" and why he was so positive for the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up on so many things?
Trump said with his voice that he was rendered a “news presenter.”
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump assessed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards North Korea’s denuclearization.
But denuclearization negotiations have been postponed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ree-jong Ho, said before the world leaders of the UN General Assembly that the North does not see a "appropriate response" from the United States to North Korea's early moves.
Instead, he said, the U.S. is continuing with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump takes a much more optimistic view of his speech at the rally.
"We agree very well with North Korea," he said.
“We had to be at war with North Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
Now we have this great collaboration.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had brought positive results – they ended the missile tests, helped liberate hostages, and the remaining U.S. troops returned home.
And he defended his unusual approach in the conversation about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to get into this crowded arena, we'll have 200 people standing right here," Trump said, pointing out to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island and killed hundreds of people
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok’s population was displaced, no elementary weather conditions were declared, which is a prerequisite for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they did not seek international help, so it is a challenge," Sumbung said.
Although “Save the Children” is a team that will travel to Palu, it is still not certain whether foreign personnel will be able to work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said that the Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies will be allowed to contribute to aid efforts.
Due to the earthquakes that continue to hit Indonesia, the country remains desperately unprepared for the anger of nature.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, they are not a common sight in other coasts.
The apparent lack of siren to warn of the tsunami in Palu, although a warning was issued, probably contributed to the loss of lives.
In the best of times, travelling through many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make the logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok for the treatment of the victims of the earthquake is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
A key point in President Yoko Vidodo's campaign was improving Indonesia's old infrastructure, and he spent a lot of money on roads and rails.
But the lack of funds has covered Mr. Yoko's administration in the eyes of the re-election next year.
Mr. Yoko is also facing pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets, using machetes, arrows, and other old weapons.

Daniel Starridge saved Liverpool from a loss in the Premier League with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Xerdan Shakiri gave Staridz the ball about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal, while his team lost 1–0.
He moved the ball from the left side before pointing it to the far side.
The ball was moving high above the sixteenth as it turned to the right corner of the net.
The ball finally passed through the jumping Kepa Arizabalaga and fell into the net.
"I was just trying to get to that position, to get to the ball, and players like Shak always give up as much as possible, so I just tried to create myself as much time as possible," Starridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante approaching, and I just touched her, and I didn’t think much about it, and I just shot.”
Chelsea led 1–0 in the semi-finals after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The attacker of the Blues scored a fifth back to Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> in the attack, before joking the ball almost to half the pitch, and then sprinted to half Liverpool.
They hurried with Kovacchich in the middle of the field.
He then directed a missile, leading Hazard to the age of sixteen.
Hazard passed the defense and finished in the net of the far-flung stable with a left leg hit next to Liverpool's Allison Becker.
Liverpool will face Naples in the group stage of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at San Paolo Stadium in Nepal, Italy.

Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of casualties from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, the country's disaster agency said earlier this week.
It was reported that many people were trapped in the debris of buildings that fell in the 7.5 magnitude quake that struck on Friday and caused waves of 20 feet high, a spokesman for the agency, Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was hit by a bullet from the collapsed buildings.
Police Arrested 32-Year-Old Man Suspected of Murder After Woman Was Killed
A murder investigation has begun since a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Mersyside, this morning.
The forty-four-year-old woman was found at 7.55 p.m. with gravel wounds on Grayson Mows Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked people in the area who have seen or heard anything to make statements.
Detective Inspector Brian Ohaghen said: “The investigation is in an early stage, but I would ask people who were near John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
“I also want to ask people, especially taxi drivers, who might have taken a picture on the cameras of the cars, to contact us because they may have information that is important for our investigation.”
A police spokesman said the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in the facility.
In the afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived at the crime scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and, as the police said, they will inform the closest people of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mows has just tried to return to his apartment, but the police told him he was not allowed to enter or exit the building.
He didn’t say anything when he found out what had happened.
The residents are now told that it will take hours before they can go back.
Someone heard a policeman tell a man that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman dressed in tears appeared on the spot.
She repeats it all the time, “It’s so terrible.”
At 2:00 a.m., two police vans were at the border, and another one was outside.
Numerous policemen stood at the border and watched the apartments.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Anonymous Crime Fighters at 0800 555 111 citing record 247 dated 30 September.
Cromwell's statue of parliament became the latest memorable hit in the "rewriting of history" box
Her persecution would be poetic justice for his "Taliban" destruction of numerous cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s figure in front of the Westminster Palace would become a target.
The iconoclast of the English Civil Wars was neither commissioned nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the works of his ancestor, Thomas, in the previous century.
Cromwell's beautiful presentation by Sir William Hammo Torneycroft is evidence of 19th century opinion and part of the figure's historiography that many believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many consider, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, that Cromwell is a defender of parliament from external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this is an entirely accurate representation is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure representing one side of that division.
His achievements as a Lord Protector are also worth mentioning and praising."
Pig killer breaks down and kills Chinese farmer
A pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwestern China, according to reports from local media.
The man, identified only by the surname "Yuan", was found dead with a skull artery wrapped in blood near a groin in the Liupanshui market in Gizhou province, South China, the Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to put vaccines on pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xinjiang, Kinghai Province, China.
He apparently travelled with his cousin from neighboring Yunan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found an open door from the neighboring pork hut.
He said that there was a big wicker with the blood of the pussy.
A Forensic survey confirmed that the <0xC2><0xA3>550-pound hop broke the farmer and killed him, according to the report.
"My cousin's nose was bloody and broken," the cousin, who was given the surname "Wu", according to a quote in the evening news outlet in Guayang.
The video from the security camera showed Juan entering the market at 4.40 p.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to John or his cousin.
A market manager told the evening news that the pig was locked up to prevent an attack on other people while the police collected evidence on the spot.
Juan’s family and market officials are allegedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pigs have been reported in the past, which have attacked people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig stuck a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife threw the animal out.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that the pigs were not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood could act as an "activator".
“They’re just playing.”
They like to bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone intentionally.
You just have to give them enough respect,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring rain to the southwestern part of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves across the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring flooding to the northern part of Mexico and the southwestern part of the United States in the next few days.
Rosa brought 85 mph winds, a Category 1 hurricane from 5.00 a.m. east time on Sunday and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, depression begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and moves east towards the western coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Lower California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm will begin to enter a large tropical rainfall.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture with the approaching depression will create abundant rainfall in the southeast in the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause sudden flooding, flow of debris and possible landslides in the desert.
Tropical moisture will cause rainfall that in some places will be approximately 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
A maximum of 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Sudden floods caused are possible due to the rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rainfall.
It is especially recommended not to walk in the desert on foot if there is a possibility of tropical rain.
The occasional rain can cause the canyons to become stormy rivers, and the thunderstorm with swamps will bring locally strong winds and dust.
The approaching depression will bring local rainfall to parts of the coast of Southern California.
Rains of more than half an inch are possible, which can cause rivers of debris and slippery roads.
This would be the first rainfall in the region since their wet season.
Occasional tropical rains will begin approaching Arizona late on Sunday and early in the morning on Monday, before the rains spread later on Monday and Tuesday.
The occasional rain will extend into the "four corners" on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature changes are expected across the U.S. due to Arctic cooling, but tropical areas remain at high temperatures.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature of short distances.
A great example of a dramatic difference in temperatures will be in the central parts of the United States on Sunday.
There is almost 20 degrees difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and De Moyne, Iowa.
In the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to re-create and expand.
Most of the central and eastern parts of the United States are expected to have a warm beginning in October with high temperatures at 80 degrees from the southern plain to the supraeast.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast indicates the possibility of over-average temperatures for the eastern parts of the United States, all by the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have watched Brad Kavanaugh's interview.
More than 20 million people watched the thrilling testimony Thursday of the nominated Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, and the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly in the 1980s, Christina Blasey Ford, on six televisions.
Meanwhile, the unprecedented political situation continued, with speakers discontinuing regular sweepstakes at the last moment since Friday: Jeff Flake, an Arizona senator, signed a deal with the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh had accepted the piano and tried to put off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his passionate testimony, said he was 100 percent sure that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, according to Nielsen, watched it on Friday.
The company had average views on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for the other networks they were showing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring people who look at offices.
To better display, it is an audience of a size similar to that of a playoff match in football or the Academy Awards.
The Fox News channel, whose leaders strongly attacked Kavanaugh's nomination, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was a central figure in Friday's drama.
After the Republican office moderately issued an announcement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras seized as protesters yelled at him on Friday morning as he was trying to get into the elevator for the hearing of the court committee.
He stood with his eyes closed for a few minutes while he was being beaten up, and all of that was broadcast live on CNN.
"They're standing here in front of you," said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth to the world?”
He was told, "You have power, and so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator door closed, that there would be more to say during the committee hearing.
Cable and radio networks all covered hours later, when the Judiciary Committee had to vote for the advancement of Kavanaugh's nomination in the Senate voting.
But Fleck said he would only do so if there was a deal with the FBI that they would consider charges against the nominee next week, which was demanded by a minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by the conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Kuns.
After a conversation with Kuns, and then with a few senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's choice was of great importance, as it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of “playing politics” about Brexit <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union for “playing politics” with Britain’s future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview immediately with her on the newspaper's main page, her former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson, attacked her so-called "Checkers" plan for Brexit, saying the proposal was that Britain and the EU should gather the "shoots" for tomorrow.
Wade Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Suspect Dieton Simson for Death of Louisiana State University Athlet
Police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University.
Twenty-year-old Dieton Simpson was arrested and imprisoned on charges of second-degree murder, Baton Rouge police department said.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Simms and Simpson, and police said that Simms lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene of the crime and said they had found Simpson's DNA on them, a WAFB partner told CBS.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted to shooting at Wade and killing him.
His bail is set at <0x24>350,000, the lawyer said.
The office of the pathologist of the eastern parish of Baton Rouge published a preliminary report on Friday, where the cause of the death was a gunshot wound in the head to the neck.
The Department of Refugees thanked the Louisiana State Police Refugee Unit, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University Police, and the citizens of the area for the assistance they provided in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The athletic director at Louisiana State University thanked the police for her "activity in search of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6.6-foot baton grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for Louisiana State University.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 caught balls per game in the last season.
On Friday morning, the coach of the Louisiana State University basketball team, Will Wade, said the team was "destroyed" and "shocked" by Sims' death.
"That's what you care about uninterruptedly," the coach said.
Volcano spills ash over Mexico City
The ejection of ash from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern settlements of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Sunday not to head towards the volcano after activity in the crater began and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded over a 24-hour period.
The center was following more dreads and shakes.
Social media images show a thin layer of ash on cars in Mexico City’s settlements, such as Sochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted increased activity of the volcano 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital after a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clashed with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with the police for public order and peace and after thousands joined the rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing vote of detachment.
A group of masked supporters of the separatists held by the police for public order and peace threw eggs and paint into powder, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would normally be full of tourists.
Later in the day, battalions broke out as well, and police used the sticks to smash the battalions.
For more than a few hours, the independence groups shouted “No Forgetting, No Forgiveness”, and on the other hand the union protesters shouted “Long live Spain”.
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries received in the protests, the local press said.
Tensions are still high in the region that wants independence, a year after Madrid characterized the October 1 referendum as illegal, but the same was celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The majority of voters voted for independence, although the output was low due to the boycott by people who are against decoupling.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police forcefully tried to stop voting in the region's polling stations.
Independence groups camped overnight on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstrations took place, but they had to change the route.
The sixty-eight-year-old electrician Narcis Termes, who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hoped that Catalonia would have a chance to gain independence.
“We had one of our most beautiful moments last year.
“I saw my parents cry with joy because they can vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite winning a vital but narrow victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain the dynamics this year with many of their most famous leaders either re-elected or in an unelected persecution or in detention awaiting an impeachment trial.
Forty-two-year-old mechanic, Hoan Puig, filming the protest in support of the police, said the conflict was supported by politicians from both sides.
“It’s getting more intense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of nine Catalan leaders incarcerated before trial last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
"To be a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londoners arrested after car crashed into a house in London
Three men, aged 33, 34, and 39, were arrested after they repeatedly crashed a car into a London-based home.
The incident occurred in Balinagard Kresent on Thursday at about 19.30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemings said damage was caused to the gate and the building itself.
At some point he might have been shot with a self-propelled arrow to the car.
Menga's goal brought Livingston a 1-0 win against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Advanced Livingston scored the Rangers by signing Steven Gerard, with his only two losses in 18 games, as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's prediction proved to be significant as Gary Hold's side rose to one level with Hibernian in second place.
Gerard's country has remained without a guest victory in the championship this season and will face the Harts leaders next week, behind which they are eight points behind.
Earlier, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingston continue to be unbeaten in the division over six games, and coach Holt has not yet faced a defeat since Kenny Miller's replacement last month.
Livingston missed his chance against the harsh guests.
Holt's team had to run for a long time before they scored the goal, and their directness caused a lot of trouble for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson tried, but drew the attack around the goal, then Alan Litgov could only direct his efforts away after slipping played the hit with Craig Halkett's head over the goal.
The guests were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could create problems with the set actions.
That’s how the decisive goal came about.
The Rangers missed a free kick, and Livingston got an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson together set up Menga, who only scored a goal from the centre of the sixteenth.
Until then, the Rangers dominated possession of the ball, but could not break through the hosts' defense, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not play for the most part.
The scheme continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos performs a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman failed to score due to the skill of Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor, and Litgov took the ball away from another set action at Livingston.
Livingston’s sixteen-year-old was constantly passing and was constantly defended, while two demands for a pen—after Halkett’s challenge for Glenn Middleton’s replacement and one for a hand-play—were rejected.
“Fenomenal” by Livingston – Analysis
Alasder Lamont on BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal game and result for Livingston
They were excellent, continuing to exceed the expectations of this upward path.
Their playing style and character barely changed after they returned to the top, but much of the merit goes to Holt for the way the team has galvanized since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding, managing a super-organized defense, but Menga still kept Conor Goldson and Joe Voral ready.
The Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As good as they were once under Gerard’s leadership, they are now falling behind with the same standards.
Their last game was weak – only once they managed to open the hosts – and that’s a little awareness of the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan gets mixed reception in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Sunday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which is aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They have been exacerbated by problems including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest population of Turks outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters came close to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of them Kurds, also said, condemning Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
Opposition protesters portray the divide of the visitor famous as a hero by some German Turks and criticised as an autocrat by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: Bicycle rider dies in collision with car
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The clash took place near the intersection of Bessud and Evelyn Streets, a high-speed traffic jam in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city at about 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance arrived, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The collision occurred a few months after another cyclist died in a traffic accident on Cleveland Street where the driver escaped, about a mile from the collision on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said officials were working on identifying the man and informing his family.
Road blocks are set up and buses are redirected and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Policemen Injured in Unrest
Six inmates were injured in riots in a high-security male prison, the prison office said.
The riots erupted at HMP Long Martin in Worcestershire at around 9.30 BST on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Specialists from the Tornado unit were brought to resolve the unrest, which includes eight prisoners and are confined to one wing.
Police were treated for minor injuries on the spot.
A prison spokesman said: “Specially trained prison personnel were trained to cope with the current incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six members of the staff were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and those responsible for it will be handed over to the police and may spend extra time behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin has 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was announced that the prison governor had received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the police for public order and peace were called to the prison to deal with serious unrest in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rose threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (may be useful for drought areas)
Tropical depression rarely strikes Arizona, but it is likely to happen early next week when the remaining force of Hurricane Rosa will pass through the desert southwestern region, bringing the risk of sudden flooding.
The state meteorological station has already issued warnings of possible abrupt flooding for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, all the way to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Left and Left.
Rosa is expected to move on a direct path through Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late on a rainy Monday.
The Phoenix State Meteorological Station tweeted that “only ten tropical cyclones have retained the status of a tropical storm or depression in the 200-mile range of the Phoenix since 1950!
Catarina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the State Hurricane Center predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated amounts up to 6 inches on the edge of Arizona's Mongolian.
Other areas of the desert southwestern region, including the central parts of the Carpathian Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to have 1 to 2 inches of rain, with isolated places up to 4 inches of rain.
For those outside the risky areas of sudden flooding, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, part of this rain is likely to be beneficial because the southwestern region is affected by drought.
According to the U.S. drought tracking agency, nearly 40 percent of Arizona is facing extreme drought, the second highest category,” said weather.com.
First, the course of Hurricane Rosa led to landslides everywhere on the Lower California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still hurricane-strength on Sunday morning with winds of a maximum of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm comes into contact with colder waters in the Pacific and is decreasing.
Therefore, rains are expected in Mexico with the magnitude of a tropical storm in the afternoon or evening hours on Monday.
Rainfall in parts of Mexico can be intense and pose a significant risk of flooding.
“It is expected to rain from 3 to 6 inches from Lower California to northwestern Sonora, with a possible maximum of 10 inches of rain,” said weather.com.
Rosa will then move north through Mexico like a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early in the morning on Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then move up through Arizona and in southern Utah late in the evening.
“The main danger expected from Rosa or its remains is the very abundant rainfall in Lower California, southwestern Sonora and the deserted southwestern region of the United States,” the State Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to bring life-threatening sudden floods and streams of debris, as well as land slipping in the mountain regions.
Midsummer Norton Attack: Four Arrested For Attempting to Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with perforated wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the area of Excelsior Terrace at Midsummer Norton around 4.00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital and is in a “stable” state.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, police said in a statement.
Police asked if anyone had a cell phone footage of the incident, to step in.
Trump said Kavanaugh “has suffered the greatest anger and anger” of the Democratic Party.
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for rejecting the most serious and scandalous Democratic Party tactics,” Trump said at a meeting in Wiling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "has suffered the greatest anger and anger" of the Democratic Party during his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying the accusations of Christina Blasey Ford having sexually assaulted her decades ago when she was a teenager.
Ford testified at the hearing and on her allegations.
The president said on Saturday that “the Americans saw Kavanaugh’s brilliantness, quality and courage” that day.
"The positive vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for a confirmation of one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with impeccable public service records," he told the crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly mentioned Kavanaugh's nomination while talking about the importance of the Republicans' early elections.
“Five more weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
“I’m not running, but I’m really fighting,” he said.
“That’s why I’m everywhere and I’m fighting for great candidates.”
Trump said Democrats had a mission to "refuse and discourage".
The first key vote for Kavanaugh's nomination in the Senate is expected no later than Friday, a senior GOP chief told CNN.
Hundreds dead in Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and the total number of victims is increasing
At least 384 people were killed, many of them from the huge waves that hit the beaches when a major earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when waves at a height of 6 meters (18 feet) struck the coast of the sunset, leading many to safe death and destroying everything on their way.
After the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, a tsunami struck.
“When the threat of a tsunami emerged yesterday, people still carried out their activities on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they became victims,” said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for the BNPB agency for disaster mediation in Indonesia.
"The tsunami did not come on its own, it drew cars, wood, houses, hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled across the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h (497 miles/h) before hitting the shore.
Some people climbed a tree to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated from 24 centers in Palu.
The air photos released by the disaster agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, smashed and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Consecutive earthquakes continued to shake the coastal city on Sunday.
The earthquakes were felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said the energy released from the massive earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the energy released from the atomic bomb in Hiroshima in World War II.
The geographical location of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow coastline, may increase the magnitude of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the shooting of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 disappeared.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be increased along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in the area called Dongala, which is closest to the earthquake's epicenter.
Communication "was completely damaged without any information" from Dongal, Nugroho said.
“There are more than 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers are referring to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse,” they said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not informing that the tsunami had hit Palu, although authorities said the waves came around the same time the warning was issued.
An amateur footage shared on social media can be heard of a man on the upper stools of the building screaming madly, warning people on the street downstairs of the nearing tsunami.
In just a few minutes, a wall of water breaks down on the coast, carrying buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't confirm the video right away.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage that cuts communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue activities.
The military began sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuees still desperately needed food and other basic necessities.
The city’s airport was reopened only for assistance and will remain closed until October.
President Yoko Vidodo had planned to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The total death toll in Indonesia’s tsunami has risen to more than 800.
It's really bad.
While the World Vision staff from Dongal arrived safely in the city of Palu, where the employees were sheltered in ceramic shelters in the courtyard of their office, they were on the way through scenes of desolation, Mr. Doseba said.
“They told me they saw many houses that were destroyed,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even as aid groups began dark attempts to start aid in the disaster, some complained that foreign aid experts were prevented from travelling to Palu.
Under Indonesian law, financial support, supplies and foreign personnel can only begin to arrive if the site of the disaster has been declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Ariani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, ‘Okay, this is a national disaster,’ we may receive international assistance, but there is no status yet.”
As the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and families of the missing still hoped that their loved ones would be the miracle that would ease the black story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was removed from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been glued under the shooting for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian state paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
The others who were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, Mr. Mandagi added, were his students.
“As a senior in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon told how, when she began circulating news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel in the paragliders community, he was desperately sending WhatsApp messages to competitors from Palu, who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages ended only with a gray sign of glittering, instead of a son.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he said.
Thieves stole <0x24>26,750 in ATM at Keyboard Support
Thieves stole <0x24>26,750 from a Brink's employee who was replenishing an ATM at Newport Key, according to a press release from Newport police station.
The driver emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to supplement it with money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the statement.
While he was busy, another man “runned from behind Brink’s employee” and stole a bag of money intended for delivery.
Witnesses noted more suspects fleeing the scene of the crime, according to the statement, but the police did not give a specific number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has any information about their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Jay
The rapper Kanye West changed his name to Yai.
The change was posted on Twitter on Saturday. He wrote: "The company formerly known as Kanye West".
Forty-one-year-old West wore the nickname Yai for a while and used the nickname for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change occurred just before his visit to Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album "Yandhi".
He will replace singer Ariana Grande on the show, which had to give up for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
Although he uses it as an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'she' is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means 'you'," West said earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with radio director Big Boy.
“What it means is I’m you, I’m us, it’s us.
She departed from Kanye, which means the only one, to Him alone, a reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, all.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of the most famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Paf Dedi, P Didi or Didi, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love (Love and Brother Love).
West's former colleague, Jay Z, also uses his name with or without a cartoon and all major letters.
AMLO from Mexico promises not to use the military on civilians
Mexico's Vice President Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed that he will never use military force against civilians as long as the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of bloody repressions against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco Plaza that he "will never use the military to repress the Mexican people."
The military fired at peaceful protesters in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at the time when leftist student movements were rooted in Latin America.
López Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly support to those who are studying and by opening more free public universities.
He said the unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attracted young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. Needs to Double the Financing of Artificial Intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its research funds in the field, said AI investor and practitioner Kai-Fu Li, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after various sections of the U.S. government gave statements about artificial intelligence, even though the U.S. has no formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China introduced its plan last year: it aims to be number one in AI innovations by 2030.
“Doublening the AI budget would be a good start, given that all the other countries are so far ahead of the United States, and we are looking for the next discovery in AI,” Lee said.
The doubling of funds could double the chances that the next major AI achievement will be made by the United States, Li said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt <0x2B> Co., Ltd., is the director-general of Silicon Valley and the New World Order.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Melon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that beat the top-ranked U.S. hotel player, and later was director of Microsoft Research and chairman of Google's China branch.
Lee thanked the U.S. government’s previous technology competitions as the agency’s robotics challenge for advanced defense research projects and asked when the next match would be, in order to help identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get state grants, Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes the academic leaders, it’s the corporations,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired experts from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. improve its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think green cards should be offered automatically to doctors of science by artificial intelligence,” he said.
The China State Council issued its plan for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The Chinese State Natural Sciences Foundation finances people in academic institutions similar to the way the Natural Sciences Foundation and other government organizations allocate money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which should include industry and academia partners, and the White House announced the establishment of an Authorized Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a <0x24>2 billion investment for the initiative called “AI Next”.
As for the NSF, they are currently investing more than <0x24>100 million a year in AI research.
In the meantime, U.S. legislation demanding the creation of the National Commission for the Safety of Artificial Intelligence has been in place for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the country's name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change its name to the “Republic of North Macedonia”, a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked its requests for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents a right to its territory and vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of most of Macedonia’s Orthodox population.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote for the referendum and the boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the exit would meet the minimum 50 percent required for the validity of the referendum.
The question of the referendum was: “Are you in favour of membership of NATO and the EU by accepting the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the price is worth paying to allow entry into bodies such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the dissolution of Yugoslavia.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because that means safer lives for all of us,” said 79-year-old Oliver Gorgievska in Scotland.
Although it is not legally binding, enough MPs said they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
A change of name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 13:00.
However, the voter turnout was 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters cast their vote.
“I came out to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Djose Tanevski, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted in a referendum in Macedonia to change the country's name, which will pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavadarkov was preparing a small stage and chairs in front of tents set by people who would boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter with our heads raised high, not from the rear entrance,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they don’t want us to be accepted as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asia integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
“I believe that the majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said.
He said the “yes” result would be “confirmation of our future.”
The poll, which was published by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research last Monday, showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum, which is below the required output.
Another survey conducted by Macedonian television Telma showed that 57 percent of voters plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent will vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the exit must be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failed referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policies since they came to power in May last year.
See also: Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero passes all of Brighton’s defenses for goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling quickly took over Brighton's defense in a 2–0 win for Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his shot look so simple in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker was given a midfielder at the start of the sequence.
He quickly passed between three defensive players of Brighton, before entering the open field.
Aguero was then found surrounded by four “greens”.
Rounded one defensive player before racing several others on the edge of Brighton's sixteen-year-old.
He then turned left of him, to Sterling.
The English striker used his first arrival at the age of sixteen to return the ball to Aguero, who with his right leg defeated Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan, with a single strike on the right side of the net.
"Aguero has legs problems," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We played for 55 to 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to have a goal at the time.”
But the initial advantage of the "heavenly blues" was given by Sterling in the Premier League fight.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero won a long ball in Brighton's territory in that game.
He sent a beautiful straight ball along the left side to Leroy Shane.
Shane touched her several times before taking Sterling to the remote stand.
The attack of the Sky Blues put the ball into the net before it went out.

Scherzer wants to play a spoiler against Rocky.
Since the Nashnels were eliminated from the fight for the playoffs, there was no reason to force another start.
But the always-competitive Scherzer hopes to stand in the central square on Sunday against the Colorado Roxies, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Roxies team, which lead a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West.
The Roxies had at least a joker for a 5–2 win over Neshnels on Friday night, but they are still struggling to determine their place in the first division.
"Although we don't play for anything, at least we'll be able to throw away knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team will most likely be playing at the highest level of any time I'll face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete in that?”
Nashnels is still due to announce a startup for a week, but they are allegedly inclined to allow Shercer to throw in such a situation.
Shercer, who will start the 34th season, was training to throw on Thursday and will usually take a break on Sunday.
Washington's draw is 18–7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeout points in 220 2/3 inches this season.
Trump's rally in West Virginia
The president indirectly mentioned the situation surrounding his election of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court while talking about the importance of the Republicans' early elections.
“Everything we’ve done so far will be put at stake in November.
Five more weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
“This is one of the big, big ones – I’m not running, but I’m really fighting, so I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere,” he said.
Trump continued, “You’re watching these horrible, horrible groups of Democrats, you’re watching what’s happening right now.
And they are determined to regain their power by using all the means at their disposal, you see the evil, the disrespect.
It doesn’t matter who they hurt, when they have to cross in order to gain power and control, that’s what they want power and control, but we won’t give them.”
Democrats, he said, have a mission to "refuse and discourage".
“And you’ve seen it in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “rageous, evil, disrespectful and untruthful.”
He mentioned Senator Diana Feynstein of the Democratic ranks, set up by the Senate Judiciary Committee, by name, to which the audience responded with shouts of indignation.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you publish the document?
Oh, ah, what.
No, no, wait a minute – that was a very bad body speech – the worst body speech I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party no longer accepts different opinions.
They don’t tolerate those who express their opinions.
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted against me, it was hardly a surprise.
However, I am only the last in the ranks of MPs from the Labour Party who have been told that we are not welcome – just because he expresses his opinion.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, has received similar treatment because she takes a decisive stance against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship movement has criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe, ironically similar issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of the meeting of the East Labor Party of Nottingham stated that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as a member of the Labour Party’s parliament, Friday night’s council meetings were just like this.
Unfortunately today, that’s not the tone of most meetings, and the promise of a “poor, lazy” policy has long been forgotten, if indeed, ever started.
It becomes increasingly obvious that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and every opinion is judged as acceptable to the party’s leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues with whom I thought we had previously shared a similar political opinion began to expect me to completely change my thinking and to take on positions that I would otherwise never take on, no matter what.
Whenever I speak in public, and it really doesn’t matter what I say, there is a critical social media abuse that calls for condemnation, denial of the center’s policies, telling me that I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And I’m not the only one with that experience.
In fact, I know I’m more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments that are directed at me are usually political.
I have great respect for the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face numerous sexist or racist abuses every day, but never withdraw.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era in politics is how levels of abuse have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should practice a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different opinions, and with every request for “untrusted” or a change in the rules of selection, the party becomes with more serious opinions.
I’ve received a lot of advice over the past two years telling me to keep my head down, not to be so loud, and then “everything will be okay.”
But that’s not the reason I came into politics.
As early as 32 years ago, when I joined the Labor Party as a student, provoked by the concern of the Thatcher government that literally left my classroom to collapse, I struggled to improve public services for those in need, whether as a local laundry advisor or a nurse.
I've never hidden my politics, including the last election.
No one in Eastern Nottingham could be confused in any way about my political stances and areas of disagreement with current leadership.
To those who supported the demand on Friday, all I want to say to them is that when the country is going to have compassion on Brexit that will hurt households, businesses and our public services, I don’t understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the country.
But I have a message that is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters, no matter whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no matter how damning threats or political opportunism you are, I will survive.

Year 38 – 17 Melrose: The Invincible Year Goes to the Top
The two late points may have changed the final score to some extent, but there is no doubt that Ear deserved the triumph in this wonderfully entertaining match of the day from the Scottish Rugby Championship.
They are now at the top of the table, the only invincible side of the ten.
In the end, it’s all due to their superior defense, as well as their improved chances, which brought the home team, and coach Peter Murchi has the right to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested through our matches so far and we’re still invincible, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said: “Happy for Ear, they’ve made better use of their chances than we have.”
Grant Anderson's score in 14 minutes, converted by Fraser Clima, gave Ear a preference, but the yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, given for the game to Warriors, allowed Melrose to improve the numbers, and Jason Baghdad to improve the numbers.
Clima prolonged Ear's leadership with a pencil, before, precisely in the half-life, he reached a point, so he converted a solo point to reach 17–5 for Ear at rescue.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's score, converted by Baghdad, reduced the lead to five points.
There was then a long detention due to a serious injury to Ruard Not, which was carried on the carrier, and from the beginning, Ear continued to cater to the point of Stafford McDowell, converted by Clima.
Ear's VD captain, Blair McFerson, then got a yellow card and again, Melrose charged for the extra man with an unconverted point to Bruce Colvin at the end of time with merciless pressure.
But the home team recovered and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for defeating Clima without the ball, McFerson wins a tachduane from the pen line on the back of Ear's sharp attack.
Clima was converting, as he did almost again from the beginning, after Kyle Row took the shot of David Armstrong and sent wing player Gregor Henry to the fifth point for the home team.
The star of “Still Game” looks ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kiran appears ready to move into the hospitality industry after it was revealed that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The fifty-six-year-old is played by Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, where he is a screenwriter and plays alongside his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next ninth season will be the last, and Kirnan seems to be planning a life after Craigleng.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source reported that Kirnan was trying to get involved in Glasgow's "successful restaurant trade".
"The Sea is Ours": Bolivia Surrounded by Continental Hopes The Court Will Reopen The Way To The Pacific
Marines patrol a hidden-located naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings have set up a blue sea flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are stamped with the motto: “The sea is ours right.
It is our duty to come back.”
Throughout mainland Bolivia, the memory of the coast lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still fresh, as is the desire to sail the Pacific again.
These hopes are now perhaps the greatest in decades, while Bolivia awaits an international court ruling on October 1 after five years of debate.
“Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and peace and of course expects a positive outcome,” said Roberto Kalsadia, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the decision of the international court on big screens everywhere in the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will judge in favor of Bolivia's lawsuit that, after decades of alternating talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate until the end of May.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, who faces a controversial re-election battle next year, is also heavily dependent on Monday’s verdict.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he said solemnly at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to judge in favor of Bolivia and that it will not change much even to judge in their favor.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands will not have the power to allocate territory to Chile and said it will not decide on the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the international court’s ruling comes just six months after the final arguments indicates that the case was “not complicated,” said Paz Zarate, an international law expert from Chile.
And the last four years may have reversed the cause of Bolivia instead of improving it.
“The current Bolivian administration is using the problem of access to the sea for its own purposes,” Zarate said.
The military rhetoric of Morales undermined the remaining goodwill of Chile, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velce, the Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision is unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an incredible opportunity to open an era of good relations with Chile" and "an opportunity to end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit," he said.
Calsadiah also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, used the problem of the sea as a political backing.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen if it can't trust the US
North Korea's foreign minister, Ree Yong Ho, said his nation would never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it could not trust Washington.
Ree spoke on Saturday in front of the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep its promises made during the Singapore summit between the rival leaders.
His comments came at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was on the verge of restarting blocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after Singapore with North Korean Kim Jong-un.
Ree says it’s “fiction” to believe that the prolonged sanctions and U.S. objections to the declaration of an end to the Korean war will bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is cautious about agreeing to the Pyongyang Declaration first to take significant disarmament measures.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is great skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning the arsenal that the country most likely sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion magazines unveil the latest line of massive hats on their way to the biggest stores near you
If you want to improve the size of your drops collection or completely block the sun, then do not look further.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown discovered a series of insanely large hats for their SS19 collection on the track that blinded the style set for Fashion Week in Paris.
Extremely impractical hats launched Instagram this summer, and these designers sent out their eye-catching creations on the track.
The piece that stood out from Valentino was a huge beige hat decorated with a wide edge in the form of feathers that flooded the model’s head.
Other oversized add-ons included zirconia crabs, magic hats, and even pineapple, but they are not designed to warm your head.
Tom Brown also discovered a selection of bizarre masks, and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had stitched lips and resembled more Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One creation resembled diving equipment entirely with glasses and a diving tube, and the other looked like a lean cornet of ice cream.
And if you continue with the huge fashion statement, you are lucky.
Followers of the style predict that huge hats can come to stores near you.
The oversized hats came very quickly after "La Bomba", the laminated two-legged-wide hat that everyone wears from Rihanna to Emily Rataikovski.
The cult fashion house that stands behind the too impractical hat that spread through social media sent another great creation along the track, a muddy beach bag with a size almost equal to the height of the model it drew.
The dark orange raffia bag, with a raffia embroidery and a white leather handle, was the piece highlighted in the La Riviera SS19 collection at Jacques’s Fashion Week in Paris.
Stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags in stores next summer, because the designer has made such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for the beach.”
John Edwards: Language Skills are Necessary for Global Citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding exam results, only reinforced by individual and group success in sport, art, music and other community achievements.
With more than 30,000 students all over Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare their students for further and higher education, the careers they have chosen, and their place as global citizens.
As an educational center that can design and implement tailored school programs, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable as an elective subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to a person in a language that he understands, it will make him imaginary.
If you speak to him in his language, it will strike him in the soul.”
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s recent exam results, we can note that languages outperform all other subjects with the highest success rate in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved a higher rating of “5<0x2B>”.
The data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 percent of students achieved a higher score of "5<0x2B>" in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French, and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly acquire in the future.
Languages now, as an elective subject, are seen at the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the programs of independent schools, as well as elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission noted that 17 percent of the reasons employers cited for failing to fill jobs were due to a lack of linguistic skills.
Hence, language skills are becoming increasingly compulsory in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more jobs looking for languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career someone will choose, if they learn a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future by having such a lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically give preference to the polyglot over the competition.
According to YouGov’s survey of more than 4,000 adults from OK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to speak, and French was the only language spoken by over ten percent, i.e. 15 percent of people.
Therefore, investing in language teaching is now important for today’s children.
Having more languages, especially those of developing economies, will equip children with better chances of finding significant employment.
In Scotland, each school will be different according to the languages it teaches.
Several schools will focus on classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important in OK when viewed in the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with professors who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills needed to succeed, no matter what the future brings.
At the moment, in the global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages will continue to be vital to the future of the country, so this must be portrayed in schools.
In fact, modern languages really need to be considered as “international communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
“It has to be done well.”
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will lead Lakers to debut in San Diego on Sunday
The wait is almost over for fans who wanted to see LeBron James launch for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play his first game in the pre-season on Sunday against the Denver Nights in San Diego.
How many minutes he plays is not yet decided.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
The Lakers reporter, Mike Trudel, tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited time.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the six-match schedule ahead of the Lakers season.
"I don't need games in the pre-season at this stage of my career to get ready," he said.
Youtube channel for Trump's rally in West Virginia
President Donald Trump launched a series of protests as part of the campaign, tonight in Willing, West Virginia.
It is the first of Trump's five scheduled protests next week, including visits to sloping places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While voting to confirm his election to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court is in the process of reconciliation, Trump is trying to build support for the upcoming midterm elections, because Republicans may lose control of Congress by a no-vote vote.
What time is the Trump rally in West Virginia tonight and how do you watch it online?
The Trump rally in Willing, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 pm. East Coast Time Zone tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia online with a live stream on YouTube.
This week, Trump is likely to turn to the hearing of the man nominating him to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense over allegations of sexual misconduct with an expected postponement of the vote in the Senate.
The primary goal of the rally series is to help Republicans win the rally in November.
Hence, from President Trump’s campaign, they said these five rallyes next week were aimed at “encouraging volunteers and supporters because Republicans are trying to protect and expand the Rothschild majority in the Senate.”
"Control in Congress is so important on his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible with the start of the tough campaign season," a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Arranged at the Wesbanko Arena in Willing, the rally could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media outlets from Pittsburgh, according to the West Virginia Metro news.
This Saturday is Trump's second visit to West Virginia in the last month, a country in which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican Senate candidate from West Virginia, Patrick Morissey, who is lagging behind the polls.
“It’s not good for Maurice that the president has to come to improve the popularity of the polls,” said Simon Heather, a politician at the University of West Virginia.
Cup Raider 2018: The U.S. team showed courage in the fight to keep hope alive at the start of individual matches on Sunday
After three one-way seasons, Saturday afternoon four might have been exactly what Ryder Cup needed.
The twisting of luck is a completely invented sports concept, but players really believe in it, and most of all in such matches.
Who would say that happiness is now?
"They had a six-point lead, and now they're four, so we're a little lucky, I guess," said Jordan Spitt after the match.
Europeans have the advantage of, of course, a four-point lead and another twelve games.
According to Spit, Americans feel that they have a weak wind in the squad, although they have enough incentive, if anything else then the form of Spit and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each scored three points of four.
Sleep was great and lead by example.
These loud screams of celebration became more and more intense during his game, with a key blow that led to a four-four straightening when he and Thomas had two failures after two rounds.
His hit with which he won the match at 15 was overwhelmingly similar, telling you that he believes the U.S. team is not out of the game.
“You just have to go deeper and take care of your match,” Spit said.
That’s all that’s left for every player.
18 holes to reach a point.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but wonderful duo of Europe is four out of four and they can’t go wrong.
"Mollywood" were the only couple without bad strikes on Saturday afternoon, but they avoided bad strikes on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the previous nine on Friday morning.
That series and the way their energy seems to flow to and from this noisy group ensures that they are the players that will win on Sunday and that there will be no other popular players that will provide a potential European victory when the sun goes down behind Le Golf National, or the National.
Both are preferred at the same time in different holes.
However, talks about European glory remain unjustified.
Buba Watson and Web Simson quickly coped with Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of the dual pair, when he merged with Alex Noren.
A failed blow and two of the first nine duels buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole they never managed to get out of.
On Sunday, however, no one can help you get out of the hole.
Couples and quads are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interaction between partners, the advice they give, the advice they don’t obey, and the way the strategy can change at once.
The Europeans played better as a team and thus achieved a significant lead in the last day, but the season of four also showed that the US team could fight even though some, especially Americans, doubted.
Europeans led by 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will enter with a solid lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after sabotage in doubles and fours of 10-6 ahead of the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Flitwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two wins while Tiger Woods struggled to take the lead so far at Le Golf National four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who struggled to keep the trophy he lost in Hazeltin two years ago, dominated the American team, which had many failures in the morning doubles and won the series by 3-1.
The Americans gave more resistance in the fours, winning two matches, but were unable to reach the lead.
Jim Furick's team needs eight points out of 12 individual matches on Sunday to hold the trophy.
Flytwood is the first European beginner to win four points consecutively, while he and Molinari, called "Molywood" after the sensational weekend, are the second pair overall to win four points in the first four matches in Cup Raider's history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in doubles, they played great and beat the worn-out Woods and the American beginner, Bryson Deshambu, with an even more pronounced score of 5&4.
Woods, who went through two matches on Saturday, at times played great, but now lost 19 of 29 matches in doubles and four and seven times in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested as the morning pairs lasted, returned as a partner to Henryk Stanson in the fours with a 2&1 defeat to Justin Johnson and Brooks Coopka - ranked first and third in the world.
However, the Europeans did not think it was a pleasant, windy day southwest of Paris.
The three-time dominant winners Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas put a two-point measure on Saturday for the Americans.
They scored a decisive 2&1 victory over the Spaniards John Rahm and Ian Pulter in the doubles and returned later to beat Pulter and Rory McLaughlin with 4&3 in fours, but lost the initials, two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup a certain team has recovered from a shortage of four points in an individual game, although as the title holders, Furick's team had a sufficiently equal score to retain the trophy.
After the second two days, however, the Sunday counterattack seems to remain over them.
North Korea says there is "no chance" of unilateral disarmament without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that prolonged sanctions deepened distrust in the United States and that there was no chance the country would unilaterally give up nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world body that North Korea took "significant goodwill measures" last year, such as halting nuclear-powered missile tests, dismantling nuclear power plants, and dismantling nuclear test facilities.
“But we don’t see an appropriate response from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and in such conditions, there is no way to unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
Although Ree reiterated North Korea's renowned complaints about Washington's resistance to accessing nuclear disarmament "in a phase", according to which North Korea would be gradually rewarded for the steps taken, his disarmament's statement made it seem significant because it did not deny it.
Ree praised a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit of the current U.S. president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Trump pledged to work towards "nuclear disarmament without nuclear weapons".
North Korea demands a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States claims that Pyongyang must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington has also declined to impose strict international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘nuclear disarmament in the first place’ and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal by compulsion, and even opposes the ‘Declaration of an End to the War’,” he said.
“The perception that sanctions can get us on our knees is a futile dream for people who don’t know us.
But the problem is that the existing sanctions deepen our distrust.”
Ree didn’t mention the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader stressed at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: "As far as the other side of this nuclear disarmament problem was so much of a non-nuclear weaponry in South Korea rather than a U.S. nuclear weapon."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ree's speech was significantly different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that the targeting of North Korea's missiles to the U.S. mainland was inevitable after "Mr. Kip's bad press" had been "rejected."
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened last year with “complete destruction” of North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said that much work remains to be done and that sanctions must remain until nuclear disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timeframe for it, stating, "Whether it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that “the Security Council’s sanctions must continue in full and without exceptions until full and final nuclear disarmament is confirmed.”
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in order to prevent the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ree on the margins of the UN General Assembly, and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last time it did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July with a statement saying he had made progress, but was denied by North Korea just a few hours later due to "gangster demands".
North Korea is committed to a meeting with Moon this month for disarmament of a missile facility, as well as a nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He said Kim had told him that the “appropriate measures” he was demanding were the security guarantees Trump gave in Singapore, as well as moves towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Attend Courses to Get Enough Holidays
A new course at Harvard University this year aims to teach all graduates more sleep in order to fight the growing macho culture of learning by staying up all night with the help of caffeine.
One researcher found that students at the world’s leading university often don’t know anything when it comes to basic self-care.
Charles Chaisler, professor of dream medicine at Harvard School of Medicine and a specialist at Brigam Women's Hospital, designed the course he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to begin the course after giving a speech about the impact of insufficient sleep on learning.
“At the end of the lecture, a girl came and said to me, ‘Why are you telling me this now, last year?’
“She said no one ever told her about the importance of sleep – which surprised me,” he told Telegraph.
The course offered for the first time this year explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help in academic and athletic outcomes and improve overall well-being.
Paul Barrera, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the university, said the university had decided to introduce the course after discovering that students had a serious lack of sleep during Sunday.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a student's home where students press on coffee cups, curtains, shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how insufficient sleep affects athletic outcomes and the importance of bedtime routine.
In the second part, participants learn how long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that it will not change the behavior of the students right away.
But we believe they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know about the health effects when you choose to smoke,” added Professor Chaisler.
The culture of pride with “working all night” still exists, he said, and in addition to modern technology and increasing pressure on students, lack of sleep is a growing problem.
To have enough sleep, with good quality, should be the student's "secret weapon" in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid obesity, making it harder to sleep because lack of sleep causes the brain to cry too much.
Raymond Sowe, a 19-year-old California student of chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Chaisler design the course after attending one of his classes last year, in his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to act as a course throughout the student city.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all graduates to complete a similar program before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Chaisler advises students to think about setting an alarm on when to go to bed, and when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by the e-screens and the LED-light, which causes it to slip away.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Manga's Goal Gathers Gerard's People
Rangers suffered another shocking, sad day when Dolly Menga's strike sent Steven Gerard's defensive squad in a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to record their first win after the February 4–1 victory in St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team made the second defeat to Gerard's team in 18 games as a manager who left his team in the first half with eight points behind.
Menga scored seven minutes before the half-time and Rangers' placement lost inspiration and chances of leveling.
Now the Rangers fell sixth, and Livingston climbed third and were behind only Hibernian according to the difference in goals.
There may be additional problems awaiting Rangers after linear judge Calum Spence had to receive medical attention due to a head injury after he was apparently hit by a remote object.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that aired in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, played with the same 11 at Livingston who scored a point with Harts last week and would be delighted at the way his well-trained sets beat opponents at every opportunity.
The Rangers may have dominated the possession of the ball, but Livingstone did more with the ball than they did.
They were supposed to score, two minutes after the start when Menga's first loss hit Scott Pittman to Alan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed the chance.
After a long-distance kick on Kihan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Litgou could only play open in the defense.
The Rangers managed to control the game, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should get a penalty in the fifteenth minute when he and Steven Lowell collided, but Judge Steven Thompson did not give a sign of endorsement of the Colombian appeal.
The Rangers managed to score only two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not struggle with Lasana Kulibali's headshot and Ovi Edaria's weak stroke.
Although the start of Livingstone's 34th minute may have been the opposite during the game, no one can deny that they deserved according to their game.
Again, the Rangers failed to cope with the Jacobs strike.
Scott Alfred did not react when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson, who cold-headedly chose Menga for a simple end.
Gerard reacted during the half-life when he replaced Kulabali with Ryan Kent, and the replacement had a quick impact when the winger passed Morellos, but the impressive Kelly reacted from his line of blockade.
But Livingstone managed to attract guest players to play the type of game they enjoy, with Litgou and Hackett capturing many of the long additions.
Holt's team could have extended the lead towards the end of the game, but McGregor set up well and prevented Jacobs before Litgow from playing head-to-head.
The replacement of Rangers, Glenn Middleton had another request for a pencil after colliding with Jacobs, but Thompson re-approved.
Almanáh: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now one side of our almanac "On Sunday in the Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and we celebrate ... the day the future physicist Johann Wilhelm "Hans" Heiger was born in Germany.
He developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, the discovery that led to the creation of a device known as the Heather Counter.
Since then it has become the main focus of science, the gauge counter has become the main focus of popular culture, as in the 1950 film The Sound of Colorado, in which the seemingly untrustworthy, cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans perform:
The man said, “What is that?”
Rogers: “It’s a gauge counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals such as uranium.
“When you put on the headphones, you can hear the effects of the atoms that emit radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: “Speak, it’s definitely jumping now!”
Hans Gaeger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name still exists.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Immune System to “Watch” Stranger Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Immune System to “Watch” Stranger Cells and Kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize alienated cells as part of treatment.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their modification in the laboratory.
You can "see" protein honor in many types of cancer, and then be returned to the body
The test vaccine delivers promising results in patients with multiple types of cancer.
In a woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize alienated cells, ovarian cancer disappeared within 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, modifying them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein honor in many cancers called HER2, and then returning them to the body.
Professor Jay Berzofski, of the American National Cancer Institute at Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a vaccine that promises a lot.”
HER2 "stimulates the growth of several types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancer, Professor Berzofski explained.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients and their “learning” how to target cancer cells works in the treatment of a particular type of leukemia.
Kanye West made a pro-Trump fall, wearing a hat with his motto, after a performance on Saturday night live.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was spotted in the studio during a live show on Saturday night, after a useless performance in which he missed U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After performing the third song that night, called The City of Ghosts, in which he wore a cap with the inscription "Make America Glorious Again," he began to criticize Democrats and repeat his support for Trump.
“Often when I talk to a white man they say, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s racist?’
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have long ago emigrated from America,” he said.
The Saturday evening live show began with a satire with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star laughed at Bret Cavano's testimony before the Senate Legal Affairs Commission, linked to charges of sexual assault by Christine Blaise Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the footage of West's fall was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock was trying to make fun of West with the announcement.
West also complained to the public that he had difficulty going behind the scenes because of his cap.
“They laughed at me behind the scenes.
They said, “Don’t come with that hat.”
They laughed at me!
Then they told me I was in the drowning place, he said, according to Washington Exeminer.
West continued, "Do you want to see the last place?" he said that "you're going to put your superman-cap on, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go on?
Try it with love.”
His comments attracted outrage from the audience at least twice, and the evening show’s team seemed embarrassed, Varayeti reported, a man told the publisher: “The whole studio takes over.”
West was brought in as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
News surprised many with the performance of the song "I Love That", dressed as a bottle of Perier.
The news got support from the leader of the conservative group TPSAD, Candy Turner, who tweeted: “For one of the most courageous spirits: I WANT YOU WHAT YOU ARE SPIRITUALLY SPIRITUAL.”
But the host of the show, Karen Hunter, wrote on Twitter that West "was her own and that's absolutely wonderful."
“But I chose not to reward someone (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his ‘art’) for whom I believe he accepts and extends an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
“We too,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, and he is now "formally known as Caine West".
He was not the first artist to change his name and follow the footsteps of Didi, also known as Puff Dedi, Puff Dedi, and Puff Dedi.
Colleague rapper Snup Dog is named Snup Lion and of course the early music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol, and then into the artist of the formerly known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man is charged with attempted murder after shooting a man at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Balihakmor, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Supreme Court on Monday.
The allegations will be examined by the public prosecutor.
Game of Thrones Star Kit Harrington Has Attacked Toxic Masculinity
Kit Harrington is known for his role as a skilled swordsman as John Snow in the violent, medieval, fantastic Game of Thrones series.
But the actor, 31, attacked the stereotype of a macho-hero, when he stated that such roles on the screen meant that young boys often felt that they had to be firm to be respected.
In a statement to the Sandy Times Culture Department, Keith said he believes that “something is wrong” and is wondering how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>SegaCall era.
Keith, who recently married Game of Thrones star Rosie Leslie, 31, admits she has "strong feelings" about it.
“I personally have strong feelings, right now – where did we go wrong with masculinity?” he said.
“What do we teach men when they grow up about the problems we see now?”
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity, thanks to the strong male characters.
He continued: “What is born, and what is being taught?
What do you learn from TV, and what on the street, that makes young boys feel that they must have a certain side of masculinity?
I think that’s one of the big questions of our time – how to change that?
“There’s something wrong with young people.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in the sequel to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying it "ends with battles and horses".
In November, Keith will perform in Sam Shepard's True West Restoration, which is the story of a film producer and his brother who is a thief.
The actor recently discovered that he thinks that meeting his wife Rose is the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in this series, so in a way she gave me my future family and my life in the future,” he said.
Rose played Game of Thrones, a character who had a love interest in the character of Keith, John Snow, in the fantasy series that won Emmy Awards.
The couple were married in June 2018 on Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/City: China Reports 14% Increase in New Cases
China reported a 14% jump in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health authorities say.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The majority of new cases were transmitted through sex, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly across parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people who became infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, from year to year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sex is an acute issue for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the discrimination against people from the LGBT community is huge.
Because of the country’s conservative values, research shows that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will ever marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease are due to inadequate sexual protection in those relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised a universal approach to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies data from a member of staff related to a Republican senator as "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday dismissed allegations that a member of her staff had disclosed personal information to three Republican senators in the U.S. on Wikipedia's lawmakers' pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the allegations were on “ultra-right” sympathizers and websites.
“Lies, lies, and even more disgusting lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information reportedly includes the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Heech of Utah.
The information appeared on the internet on Thursday, posted by an unknown person in Capitol Hill as the Senate panel was hearing charges of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh, who was appointed a Supreme Court judge.
The information appeared shortly after Kavanaugh was questioned by three senators.
Conservative locations such as Gateway Pandit and Redstate have announced that the IP address that identifies the source of the announcement is linked to the Waters office and information about a Waters staff member has been released, Hill said.
“These unhappy allegations are completely false and represent an absolute lie,” Waters said.
"The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of those false and false accusations - is in no way responsible for the information transmitted.
The unhappy accusations are completely false and are an absolute lie.”
Waters' statement quickly attracted criticism on the internet, including former White House press secretary Ari Flaisher.
“These denials are nerve-wracking,” Flaisher wrote.
“This shows that she has no temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven’t done, they shouldn’t be angry.
He can't be challenged.
He should not be questioned about the defendant’s motives.
He needs to be calm and calm.”
Fletcher seems to have compared Waters' reaction to critics from Democrats linked to Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of looking too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is nominated to replace Waters in the midterm elections, was also announced on Twitter.
“If it’s true, it’s a big deal,” he wrote on Twitter.
In her statement, Waters said her office had notified “competent institutions and police of false allegations.
“We will allow the perpetrators to be identified, and that they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are harmful and dangerous to some and all of my staff.”
Johnny English's Thought Attacks Again - Burns Rowan Atkinson's Spy Cheats
It is now traditional to look for elements of Brexit in every new film with a British relationship, and that seems to apply to this renewal of the franchise of the scam, action comedy Johnny English - which started in 2003 with Johnny English and re-enacted in 2011.
Will the careful self-examination of the issue of how obvious we are for nowhere be the new export opportunity that the nation has?
Despite all this, the face with big eyes and many make-ups of incompetent Johnny English was licensed to "suspend" things a second time - his name primarily implies that he is a comedic creation with a wide range of features made for viewers in cinemas.
He is certainly a sketch of a secret agent who, despite his bizarre efforts for a careful glamour after a bit like Clouseau, has characters of Mr. Bin and a part of the boy who plays a note of the song Cochii on Fire from the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics and the Olympics.
Its foundation is the traveller and mysterious international man Atkinson who once appeared in Barclays' now forgotten TV ad, leaving chaos behind.
There's one or two moments in Johnny English's latest edition.
I really liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor, and the rotor's flaps hit his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy can be seen, but humor seems weak and somewhat superficial, especially since "serious" movie brands such as 007 and Impossible Mission contain elements of the comedy itself.
Humor seems to be intended for children rather than adults, and for me, Johnny English’s crazy misfortunes aren’t as inventive and focused as the nutshells of Bin Atkinson’s character.
The issue that is constantly being debated is that the UK is in serious trouble.
Cyber-hacker infiltrated Britain's super secret spy network, uncovering the identities of all British agents on the ground, disappointing the agent in charge - a disappointing little role for Kevin Eldon.
In the last chance for a prime minister who is a pompous and combative figure and already suffers from a complete melting of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives herself to this character of Quasi-Theresa May, but there is nothing special in the script to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since every active spy is compromised, she will have to activate one of the retired.
And that means calling himself Johnny English, who is now working as a private school teacher, but “in black” gives lessons for secret agents: there are a few good guys here, when English offers a rock academy-like spying school.
Ingrish was promptly summoned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with former collaborator Bow, who played Ben Miller.
Bow is now a married man, in connection with a submarine commander, a comedic role in which Vicky Pepperdin is not well-used.
Well, Batman and Robin, for screwing up everything in the Royal Secret Service, return to action and meet fatally beautiful Ofelia Boulettova, a character played by Olga Kirilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the dangerous influence of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the evil Jason Walt, dubbed by Jake Lacey.
Ingles and Bow begin their odyssey of absurd actions: remodeled as waiters they burn up a French restaurant; they make a waste after they sweep themselves on the luxury yacht of Volta; and Ingles starts a real anarchy when they try to use it.
All brakes are removed for the last sequence, but as much as it is kind and noisy, there is a lot of children's TV throughout the film.
Nice temperate things.
And as with the other movies with Johnny English, I can’t help but think: can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role to use his talent?
Labourers deny that they plan to work four days a week, but get paid for five.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party will consider a radical plan that will allow the British to work four days a week – but will be paid for five.
The party allegedly wants corporate bosses to take advantage of the savings they make with artificial intelligence to give workers another day off.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend – but would take the same pay.
According to the sources, the idea “responses” to the party’s economic agenda and plans for the country to be given to the workers.
The transition to a four-day work week is backed by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
A top-ranked member of the party said of the Sandei Times: “The strategy review should be published by the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day working week is an effort that is in line with the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as the entire industrial strategy of the party.”
The Labour Party will not be the first to accept such an idea, the Green Party advocated a four-day working week during the 2017 parliamentary election campaign.
However, the aspiration was not accepted by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not a party strategy and the party is not considering such an idea.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonald used last week’s Labour Conference to present his vision for the socialist revolution of the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to seize the power of “faceless directors” and “profiters” in utilities.
The chancellor’s plans in the shadow also mean that current shareholders in the water supply companies may not get the whole part back because the Labour government could make “deductions” due to unethical behavior.
He also confirmed plans for employees to become part of company boards and create Inclusive Property Funds, with 10 percent of private firms' capital being owned by employees, who will be able to take an annual dividend of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are making a 60-Minute statement about whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could reconsider them.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh postponed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least one week and updated the question of whether the bureau's findings could rethink some Republican senators to withdraw support.
In an interview published on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could uncover something that would make them reconsider.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina colleague.
“I think of course,” said Kennedy.
“I said when I went to the hearing, I said, I was talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the charges were filed, and I said, "Did you do that?"
He was strong, determined, unambiguous.”
Graham's voice, however, looks like a slender stone.
“My decision has been made for Brett Kavanaugh and a shocking charge is needed,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett was denying vigorously," Graham said, thinking of Christine Blaise Ford.
“Everyone who was named couldn’t confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I don’t see anything new changing.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did you do anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York will be held the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring famous stars and an impressive mission; an end to poverty.
It's now held for the seventh time, and the Global Citizens Festival will be attended by tens of thousands of people who will come to the big lawn in the central park, not just to enjoy all-star performances like Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Sean Mandee.
The Global Citizens Festival, which started in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international activist group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), participants must perform several tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader’s subnet, phone call or any other purpose whatsoever.
But how successful is a Global Citizen because there are 12 years left to achieve the whole?
Is the idea of a free concert a real way to convince people to ask to take something or just another case of “click-activism” – people who feel they’re making a real difference by signing a petition on the Internet or sending a message on Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizens have claimed that they have registered more than 19 million “activities” from supporters, who have acted for many different purposes.
They say these activities have helped encourage world leaders to embark on commitment and strategies that have raised more than <0x24>37 billion and that will impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 promises and announcements as a result of their activities, of which <0x24>10 billion has already been sent or collected.
The group estimates that the funds raised have a direct contribution of nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key promises are the Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and implementers, based in the UK, dedicated to “helping children make the most of their potential”, which promises to provide <0x24>35 million to Rwanda for help from around the world.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens just like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a note in history,” said Ambassador Tracy Ulman of Power of Nutrition in 2018.
The group also said over 5,000 activities were undertaken related to calls to improve the nutrition of mothers and children in Britain, the government announced funding for the project, the Power of Nutrition, which will include 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
As an answer to one of the most frequently asked questions on their website, “Why do you think you can put an end to extreme poverty?”
From a Global Citizen, they replied: “It will be a long and difficult journey – we will never succeed.
But, like the big civil and anti-apartheid movements ahead of us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janel Mona are some of the artists to perform at this year's New York event, hosted by Deborah-Lee Furnes and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use navy to "block" to prevent Russian energy exports - Ministry of Interior
Washington may “if necessary” use the navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the market, including the Middle East, U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinki said, as quoted by Washington Exeminer.
According to Zinki, Russian interference in Syria - namely, where it acts at the invitation of a legitimate government - is a parade for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because of the energy market, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe,” he said.
And according to the government, there are ways to deal with it.
“The United States has the ability, with our navy, to ensure that the sea routes will remain open if necessary by blocking their energy from reaching the market,” he said.
Zinki addressed the attendees of an event organized by the Energy Consumers Alliance, a non-profit group that portrays itself as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He continued to compare Washington’s approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that he is effectively the same.
“The economic option of Iran and Russia is, more or less, raising the role and replacing fuels,” he said, speaking of Russia as a “one unpleasant pony” with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
The statement came after the Trump administration launched a mission to encourage exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to step down from the “inappropriate” North Tech 2 pipeline project, which Trump said made Berlin a “prisoner.”
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Tech 2 pipeline, worth <0x24>11 billion, should double the current capacity of the 110 billion cubic meters pipeline, is just an economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s strong opposition to the project is only for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that customers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow.
The American stance found resistance from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organization, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), has called on the United States not to interfere in European energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third party interferes in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kamf, the first man in the German Federation of Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "will carefully consider" whether to run for president in 2020, said Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "see carefully" whether she would run for president after the midterm elections.
During a meeting at the city assembly in Hollyok, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our dysfunctional government, which means a woman at the front,” she said.
“After November 6th, I will carefully consider whether to run for president.”
Warren assessed President Donald Trump’s work during the meeting in the city council and said he “is leading the country in the wrong direction.
“I am too concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren is open in her criticism of Trump and the man he nominates as a Supreme Court judge, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “Of course, we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that a large number of voters in her constituency think she should not run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters said the senator should not run, according to a study by the University’s Center for Political Research at the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent support such a proposal.
The poll showed more support for the nomination of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential nomination and 48 percent against.
Other well-known names from the Democratic Party that are being discussed for a 2020 nomination include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about Trek Palin's post-traumatic syndrome at Donald Trump's rally
Trek Pailin, 26, has spent a year in Iraq since enrolling in September.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident on Monday evening.
"What my son is going through, what he's going through after he returns, I know how other families who have been torn apart because of the post-traumatic syndrome and the wounds that our soldiers are returning with," she told the audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa.
Pailine called the arrest an "elephant in the room" and said that her son and other military veterans "return a little different, they return solid, they return, and they ask if there's any respect for what they and their fellow soldiers have for."
He was arrested on Monday in Basila, Alaska and charged with domestic violence by assaulting a woman's face, along with a report of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a police spokesman in Basila.
18 states and the city of Washington support the challenge of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the city of Washington are backing the challenge of a new U.S. policy that prevents the granting of asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence or gang violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the city of Washington filed a petition to the court (amicus curiae) in Washington on Friday in support of an asylum seeker who disputed policy, according to the NBC News.
The full name of the prosecutor in the Grace v. Parliament case, which the U.S. Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy, has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and the violent members of his gang" had abused her, but U.S. authorities rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was imprisoned in Texas.
The state defender, represented by Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of U.S. asylum claims originate, as a nation with persistent gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturns a 2014 Immigrant Complaints Board decision that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
U.S. Attorney General Carl Rasin said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignored decades of passing laws at the federal, federal and international level."
"Federal law requires all asylum claims to be adapted to certain facts and circumstances of the application and such provision violates that principle," according to the petition to the court (amicus curiae).
In addition, the letter’s advocates argue that policies preventing immigrants from entering are detrimental to the U.S. economy because they are more likely to become entrepreneurs “to offer the necessary workforce.”
Public Prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to give asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
“There is asylum for those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in a statement.
Asylum has never been conceived as a solution to all the problems -- even all the serious ones -- that people around the world face every day.
Desperate rescue efforts are being made in Palu as the number of casualties doubled in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is incredibly serious.
"It's very tense," 35-year-old Risa Kusuma said as she wore her male baby at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute, ambulances carry bodies.
There is no clean water.”
Residents return to their destroyed homes and pick from their listed items to save something they can.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Due Harris, who has fractures on his back and shoulder, rested in front of the Military Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside, due to frequent consecutive minor earthquakes.
Tears fell into his eyes when he described the strong earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to be saved.
I was pushed into the ruins of the wall, I think," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in the city for a wedding.
“I heard my wife ask for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and the child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of “Maltreatment” with “Propaganda Advertising”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page advertisement in a U.S. daily newspaper listing the mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using U.S. media.
U.S. President Donald Trump spoke last Wednesday about the paid supplement to Tea Day in the De Moine Register - the best-selling newspaper in Iowa - after accusing China of interfering in the U.S. Congressional elections on Nov. 6.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked the United States service for Reuters as a new phase in Washington’s escalation campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish commercials to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a trade war in which import tariffs are offset with each other.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were aimed at exporters from states such as Iowa, which support Trump's Republican party, Chinese and American experts have confirmed.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former long-time Iowa governor, a major exporter of agricultural products in China, said Beijing is hurting U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a column in the Sunday edition of the De Moine Register, “is now doubling the bullying with propaganda advertisements in our free press.”
“At the decimation of propaganda, the Chinese government is abusing the nurtured American tradition of free speech and free media by placing advertisements in the De Moin Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the contrary, in the nearby newspaper stand here in Beijing, you can only find a limited number of opinions and you will not see the real reflection of the desperate opinions that the Chinese people may have about China’s problematic economic trajectory,” he said.
He added that “one of the most read newspapers in China rejected his bid to publish” to the column, although he did not say which newspaper it is.
Republicans move away from women's votes ahead of midterm elections because of the debacle with Kavanaugh, analysts warn
As many Republicans do not observe or defend Bret Kavanaugh's nomination in the Supreme Court despite several allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn that there will be negative consequences, especially from women in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding the case are extremely strong, and most Republicans have already stated that they want to continue voting.
Of such things there is no turning back," wrote Grant Richter, a professor of political science at the Maxwell Faculty of Syracuse University, for Hill, in a column published on Saturday.
Richard said it was doubtful that the pressure on the FBI's investigation of Senator Jeff Fleck (Republican from Arizona) would be enough to calm angry voters.
“Women won’t forget what happened yesterday — they won’t forget tomorrow, nor in November,” said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the MoveOn Progressive Group, on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted “November is coming!” in a protest in the Senate hallway, when Republicans, who have control in the Legal Affairs Committee, decided to continue with Kavanaugh’s nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Sorcy Lee Kristin.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of Democrats will be high,” said Stu Rottenberg, a non-partisan political analyst for the news site.
“People already say they’re tall; that’s right.
But they can be higher, especially among independent women voters in the suburbs and young voters aged 18 to 29, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court's candidate, were detailed, analysts suggest it could have negative consequences if Republicans continue to vote.
"This has become a big mess for the Republican party," former president of the Republican National Committee Michael Stile said earlier last week, according to the NBC news.
“It’s not just about the vote in the commission or the last vote or whether Kavanaugh will go to the hearing, it’s also about how Republicans handled this and how they treated it,” said Guy Cecil, director of the United States Priorities Committee, a group that assists in the election.
However, Americans are divided about who to trust after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, although more people accept the first-mentioned side.
A new survey by Yu-Gov showed that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe in Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought that Kavanaugh was probably or definitely lying when testifying, while only 30 percent thought the same about Ford.
Following Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one more, to Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian said.
Ford testified before the Senate Legal Affairs Committee, under oath last week that Kavanaugh had attacked her drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez accuses her of showing her genitals at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
Inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, starts a startup business that claims to be a rival to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrapt, is a company built on the Solid open source platform at Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and which people have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt’s intention was “world domination.”
“We have to do it now,” he said about the start-up business.
“Now is the historical moment.”
The application uses Solid’s technology to enable people to create their own “Internet Data Warehouse” or abbreviated POD.
It can contain contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Sleek and Spotify to be all available to one browser at the same time.
What is unique about personal data storage on the Internet is that it depends only on the user who has access to a certain type of information.
The company calls it “personal data-enhancing.”
Inrapt’s idea, according to the company’s CEO John Bruce, is to provide resources, process and appropriate skills for Solid to be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased from IBM, several developers with a contract to work on the project and a community of coders-volunteers.
Starting this week, tech developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrapt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team did not talk to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change where their business models are completely reversed overnight.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a press release released on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrapt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new Solid-based network."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the World Network Consortium of the Institute of Technology in Massachusetts.
Recently, Berners-Lee has been an influential spokesman in the debate on internet neutrality.
Even at the start of Inrapt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Network Consortium, the Internet Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m a big optimist for the new era of the Internet,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: Famous Victorian Cross Carrier of the First World War
The only Anglican clergyman to have received the Victorian Cross during World War I as a fighter has been celebrated in his hometown for 100 years.
Colonel Bernard Van received recognition on 29 September 1918 in an attack on Belenglise and Lechaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had received the highest British military award.
A commemorative stone was discovered by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rashden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said it was "an incredible symbolism" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather received the award.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Van led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin, "From a very dense fog and under a strong fire of cannons and machine guns."
He later ran to the places from where he was shot and with “most courage” led forward, before attacking the gun nest himself and disabling three of the servants.
Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - almost a month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather’s works were “something I know I will never be able to accomplish, but it’s something that doesn’t make me humble.”
He and his brother Dr. James Van also laid a wreath after the parade led by the Youth Imperial Band of Brentwood.
Michael Van said, "It is a great honor to be a part of the parade," adding, "the courage of a real hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given by many people."
Fans of combined martial arts stayed awake all night watching the Whitehorse 206, instead getting Peppa Pig.
Imagine, you’ve been awake all night watching the Whitehorse 206, and you don’t have the opportunity to watch the main event.
The San Jose list contained 13 fights, including six with the main card that were shown live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gerard Mussasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face off, viewers in Britain were shattered when the channel moved to Pepa Prase.
Some were not impressed after they stayed awake until early hours because of the struggle.
One of Twitter’s fans described the move to a children’s cartoon as “some sick joke.”
“The law is such that at 6 a.m. that content was inappropriate, so it had to be transferred to a children’s program,” said Dave Schwarz, Vice President for Marketing and Communications at Whitehall, when asked about the transmission.
"The Pig's Pope, yes."
Whitehorse chairman Scott Cooker said they will work on a schedule that will include viewers from the UK in the future.
“I think when I think about releasing, I think we can probably find a solution,” Cooker said.
“But there are six o’clock in the morning on Sunday and we will not be able to find a solution on Sunday at our time, but on Monday at their time.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, we got a lot of messages on the transfer and none of them were kind.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't, it was a legal question.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We're going to limit the number of five fights instead of six -- as we usually do -- we've been trying to deliver more for the fans and we've been exaggerating.
It's an unfortunate situation.
Records on an empty island: Tom Daley felt “inferior” because of sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality – but that motivated him to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize everything until he went to high school that “not everyone is like me.”
Speaking on Radio 4's first Discs on a desert island, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about the rights of homosexuals to give "hope" to others.
He also said that becoming a parent made him care less about the Olympic victory.
The regular presenter of the long-running show, Kirsti Yang, took months off due to illness.
Appearing as a comparative figure in Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less" than anyone else as he grew up because "it was not socially acceptable to have sympathy for boys and girls."
He said: “Until today, those feelings of inferiority and diversity were the things that gave me the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that it was “something,” he said, in order not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The two-bronze medalist has become a well-known supporter of LGBT campaigns and has used his performance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke in public because he felt happy that he could live openly without division and wanted to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said he was in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013 - "I was surprised."
Dale married the Oscar-winning 20-year-old last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through so much at such an early age" - he went to the first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it's hard to find someone of the same age who has experienced similar heights and depths.
The two became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daley said that "all his views" had changed.
“If you asked me last year, it was all about ‘I need to win a gold medal’,” he said.
“You know, there’s more important things than a gold medal at the Olympics.
“My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father refused to die and one of the last things he asked him was if they had tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘You won’t be here to be in the first row,’” he said.
“I held my hand when he stopped breathing and when he actually stopped breathing and died, I finally realized he was unbeatable,” he said.
The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - jumping in front of a home crowd at the Olympics, there's no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first choice of song - Pride of Heather Small - which turned his head in preparation for the Olympics and which he was still struggling with.
Records on a desert island on BBC Radio 4 are on Sunday at 11:15 British summer time.
Michaelson, a horse not in shape, was on the bench during the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Michaelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays the 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to change his shape to avoid an unhappy turn.
Michaelson, who played at the 12th record-breaking Biennale event, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furick during Saturday's doubles and fours.
Instead of being at the center of attention, as often represented by the United States, the five-time winner, he took the time to spin and practice his game, the range, in the hope that he would fix what he was silent.
He has never been the best driver, not even at the top of his career, the 48-year-old is not an ideal choice for the narrow Le Golf National, where long-running rough hits are a regular penalty for negligence.
And if the field itself isn't scary enough, Michelson, in his ninth game on Sunday, is facing the precise champion of the British Open France Molinari, who plays in a pair with the starter Tommy Flytwood to win all four non-sports.
If the Americans, who lack four points before 12 individual matches, start hard, Michelson’s game can be decisive.
Furick expressed confidence in his man, not that he could see anything else.
“He fully understood the role he had today, touched my back and put his hand around me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furick said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He’s been a part of the celebrities and has given a lot for these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn’t think of him as playing two games.
I've been thinking more, but that's how it went, and we thought that's how we got to act.
He wants to play, just like everyone else.”
Michaelson will break Nick Faldo's record for the most-played Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
It could be the end of his career at the Ryder Cup where he has never achieved the best results in his individual career.
Michaelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furik said his presence brings something intangible to the team.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s sensitive, he likes to joke with people and he’s a great guy at team meetings.”
"I think the younger players were having fun in the game with him, just like this week, which was fun to watch.
It’s more than just a game.”
European Captain Thomas Bjorn Knows That Great Leadership May Be Disappearing Soon
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that significant leadership ahead of individual matches on the final day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable position.
The Dancer debuted at a game in Valderama in 1997, when the guy led by Steve Balesteros had a five-point lead ahead of the Americans, but "I crossed the goal line only with the bearers", with the least lead of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"I remind myself that we had a great leadership in Walderam; we had a great leadership in Brooklyn, when we lost and in Walderam, when we won for a little while," Bjorn, the iconic manager, said after watching the 2018 class win by 5-3 on a 5-6 fifth.
Well, history will show me and everyone in the team that this is not over.
You're ready for tomorrow.
Go out and play right.
This isn’t over until the game is over.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win the trophy and the focus remains on it.
I say all the time, I'm focusing on 12 players in our team, but we're fully aware of the opposing side - the best players in the world."
Bjorn added, “I don’t want to give an early assessment on this issue.
Tomorrow's game is a different one.
Tomorrow we’re going to have an individual game, and that’s a different thing.
It’s great to play with a partner when things go well, but when you play individually, then all abilities as a golfer are tested.
That’s the message that should be sent to the players, to give themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner and he has to give everything he can.”
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furick will require players to play better individually than they played in pairs, with the exceptions being Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furick himself was on both ends of the shifts on the last day because he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before finishing as a loser when Europe performed "The Miracle in Medina"
“I remember every word there,” he said when asked about how Ben Cranshaw, the captain in 1999, unified the players on the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we want to start like the last start we saw in Brooklyn, as we saw in Medina.
When the moment moves in a certain direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the midfielders.
We set the line appropriately and the order of the team is according to how we feel, you know, we want to do magic tomorrow.”
Thomas was given the task to fight first and face Rory McLaughlin's most important match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flittwood and Ian Polter with the other Europeans in the most important half of the series.
“I decided to play this way with the guys because I think that’s how we’re going to cover everything,” Bjorn said of the choices in the individual games.
The new German warship has been postponed.
The German Navy's latest fleet was to be delivered in 2014 to replace outdated warships since the Cold War, but it won't happen until at least next year due to the wrong systems and rising prices, local media reported.
The delivery of the Rhineland-Falz, the leading new class frigate Baden-Württemberg, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper DiCate, calling for a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the navy in 2014, but problematic issues after the shipment hindered the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will be a replacement for the outdated Bremen-class frigates.
It is known that they will contain a powerful cannon, a large number of anti-aircraft weapons and naval missiles, as well as some stern technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic tracks.
Among other important features is the less frequent maintenance - it should be possible, the latest frigates, to be absent up to two years from home ports.
However, the ongoing delays mean that modern warships - which should allow Germany to have power over the oceans - will already be outdated as they enter service, notes DiCity.
The unlucky F125 fleet reached the frontlines last year, when the German navy officially refused to accept the ship and returned it to the Blom and Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned the ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media cite a number of key “software and hardware defects” that made the warship useless if sent on a combat mission.
Software shortcomings were particularly important because the Baden-Württemberg-class ships will have a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the crew of the older Bremen-class frigates.
It was also found that the ship was drastically above planned weight, reducing its performance and limiting the Navy's ability to add upgrades in the future.
The Rhineland-Palatinate weighs 7,000 tons and is believed to be twice as heavy as the ships of a similar class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the problematic hardware, the cost of the entire project - including the training of the crew - also became a problem.
It is said to have reached an incredible <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0x24>3.6 billion) - an increase from the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems faced by the latest frigates are particularly important due to warnings about Germany’s declining naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defence commission, confirmed that the navy “is missing ships that can be deployed.”
The representative said the problem had worsened over time, because the old ships were withdrawn from service, but no replacement ships were provided.
He complained that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates could join the navy.
The National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of the Lilies
A new property research is being conducted in the Scottish mountain ranges in order to discover how the Lilies use the border in search of food.
There is hope that the findings will give answers to the behavior of unique flying mammals and help carry out protective activities in the future.
The study of the scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common and soprano lilies, as well as the long-eared brown lilies and the daubenton lilies at Inverou Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to monitor the activities of the lilies during the season.
The NAC staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile research using handheld detectors.
Expert analysis of sounds from all footage will determine the frequency depending on the type of lily.
Then a map of habitats will be prepared to create a detailed picture of their behavior within the boundaries.
Rob Devar, a nature conservation adviser at N-T-ES, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of living are most important to lilies and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of lizards and how best to sustain forests for lilies and other related species.
The population of Lilians in Scotland and Britain has declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development that affect the beds and the loss of habitat.
Windshields and lights also pose a risk, as well as sticky flies tapes and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks on domestic cats.
Lilians aren't really blind.
However, because of their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a prey.
They use sophisticated echo-location technique to find insects and obstacles in the flight path.
An-Ti-Es, which cares for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the state, takes the Lilians very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who regularly conduct research, bed inspections, and sometimes rescues.
The organization even establishes the first and only lily reserve in Scotland of the Trive property in Damfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species living in Scotland.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Triv we have an excellent area for lilies," he said.
“We have old buildings, very old two and very good housing.
But there are a lot of unknown things about the lilies, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us learn more about what they need to progress.”
He stressed that it is important to check if there are lilies before property renovations are carried out because the unconscious destruction of beds can destroy up to 400 females and infants, and destroy the entire local population.
Lilians are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture or disturb or destroy their beds.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish Officer in the Lilies Protection Trust, encourages the public to help.
She said, “We still have a lot to learn about the lilies and our other species, we just don’t know how they live.”
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape and lawyers will sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the allegations of rape “fake news,” adding that people “like to promote themselves” using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which has released the charges.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus has been charged with raping an American woman named Catherine Majorga at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid her <0x24>375,000 not to mention the incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Speaking on a live video on Instagram of its 142 million followers, hours after the charges were filed, Ronaldo, 33, rejected the reports as "fake news".
“No, no, no, no, no.
What was brought out today is fake news,” the five-time gold ball winner said in front of his camera.
“They want to promote themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by mentioning my name, but that's part of the job.
"I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player added, laughing.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the charges, which they called "unacceptable transfer of privacy doubts," according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Sherc said the player would seek damages for “moral damages in addition to the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years.”
The incident allegedly took place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, California.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents submitted to the Clark County court.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent" a "good boy", but dropped below that "one percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but that there was consent.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and pictures of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later agreed to a no-judgment deal because she was afraid of revenge and was worried "that she would be publicly embarrassed".
The 34-year-old says she is now seeking to change the deal because she has trauma from the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on his way to join Real Madrid from Manchester United when the alleged attack took place and this summer moved to Italian giant Juventus with a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: Britain "will always regret" the loss of car manufacturers
Britain will "always complain" if it loses its status as a world leader in automotive manufacturing after Brexit, business minister Greg Clarke said.
He added that it was “concerning” that Britain had announced to the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at the factory in Burnston, near Derby.
“We don’t need a deal,” Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of the border stops in the case of a no-deal Brexit would cost jobs.
The factory in Burnston, which produces Toyota Auris and Avenis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, there will be an end to production at our factory," said Marvin Cook, CEO of Toyota in Burnston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK expressed concerns about how cross-border trade, including Honda, Be-M-Ve and Jaguar Land Rover, would work if they left the EU without a deal.
Be-M-Ve, for example, says he will close his mini-factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what automakers call the risks of the logistics chain in the case of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates according to the “exact time” system, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU, for cars according to orders.
If Britain left the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be a break at the border, which, according to the industry, could cause delays and deficiencies in parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's inventory at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and production will stop.
Mr. Clark said Theresa May’s plan for future relations with the EU was “exactly designed to avoid such border checks.”
"We need to have a deal. We need to have the best deal that will allow us not only the success we will enjoy in the present, but to grab this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4 today.
“The evidence not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers is that we must be able to continue what is a very successful set of logistics chains.”
It could not say how long the production would be halted, but in the long run it warned that the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and cost jobs.
Peter Cuvalaris, who has been working in Burnston for 24 years and is a representative of the trade union at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, once those jobs are gone, they will never come back.
According to a government spokesman, “We have made a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, the White House said.
Donald Trump’s important meeting with deputy public prosecutor Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed by another week” as the fight for Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination for judge in the Supreme Court continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, relations between Trump’s aides and Russia, and potential violations of the president’s laws.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy public prosecutor and thereby threaten Miller’s independence, he has been spurring talks in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was considering wearing a camera to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein was denying the report.
But with the release of the reports last Monday, he went to the White House with the intention of resigning.
Instead, the meeting with Trump was scheduled for Thursday because he was at the United Nations at the time in New York.
Trump said he “didn’t want” to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash at the Senate Justice Committee hearing in which both Kavanaugh and one of the women accused of sexual harassment were witnessed.
On Friday, Trump issued an order to conduct a one-week FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh lawsuits, which would further postpone the vote in the Senate.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, has appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date of the meeting is not yet fixed, it could be held this week, and it could be postponed for another week in view of all the things that are happening in the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see how things are going and I’m always trying to keep the press informed.”
Some journalists dispute the claim: Sanders has not held a briefing for the White House journalists since September 10.
Director Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the small number of briefings were not due to the dislike of the "great influence" of television journalists, although he added, "I will agree with the fact that they have a great influence."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the media would increase.
"The president organizes more sessions of questions and answers than any president before him," she said, adding, without giving any evidence: "We've looked at those figures."
“There will still be briefings,” Sanders said, “but if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, it’s far better than talking to me.
"We try to do this more often, and you're witnesses that we've been doing it all the time over the last few weeks, and talks with the president of the United States will replace the briefings for the journalists."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends open sessions or press conferences when visiting senior officials.
He rarely participates in independent press conferences.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why it is so with his uncontrolled and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of crowded journalists.
The Secretary of Health in a letter to EU workers employed in Scotland’s national health system in connection with fears related to Brexit
The health secretary wrote a letter to EU workers employed in Scotland's national health system expressing the country's gratitude and their desire to remain after Brexit.
Gin Freeman, an MP in the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter less than six months before the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish government is already obliged to cover the costs of resolved applications for status for EU citizens working in lower-level public services.
Mrs Freeman wrote in her letter: “Negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on the withdrawal continued during the summer, with a view to making the expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK government has also been intensifying its preparations for the possibility of no agreement.
I know this period is very disturbing for all of you.
That is why I wanted to emphasize how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and across the EU share valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and are useful for the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Christian Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering head injury
Christian Abercrombie, the defensive player of the Tennessee State Tigers, was undergoing an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury on Saturday when the team lost 31-27 to Vanderbilt Commodores.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the injury occurred just before the half-life.
“He came to the sideline of the playground and just fell to the ground,” Reid said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen outside the playground, then put it in the carrier and took it for further evaluation.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had retired from surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information on the type/degree of the injury" and "Tennessee State" is trying to find out when the injury actually occurred.
Abecrombie is a second-year student and plays her first season in a red suit at Tennessee State after her transfer from Illinois.
He made a total of five knockouts on Saturday before leaving the game, resulting in a total of 18 knockouts this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying a property in the UK.
According to Tory’s new plans, foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the UK, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless people.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s attempt to attract young voters
The higher administrative fee will be imposed on those who do not pay tax in the UK.
The ministry expects this move to raise up to 120 million pounds a year, funds that will be used to help homeless people.
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying a property in the UK, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless people.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s attempt to attract young voters with his promises to provide affordable housing and to focus on high-income people.
The higher administrative fee will be imposed on individuals and companies that do not pay tax in the United Kingdom, with additional funds to strengthen the Government's efforts to improve the situation with homeless people.
The additional amount that, in addition to the current administrative fee, includes the higher levels that were introduced two years ago for a second home and the purchase of a property with the intention of renting it can reach up to three percent.
The ministry expects this move to raise up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the newly built properties in London are purchased by non-UK residents, leading to price increases and causing difficulties for people who buy property for the first time to get involved in this process of buying a property.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "spirit cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy was announced just weeks after Boris Johnson asked to cut the administrative fee to help young people buy their first home, according to the report.
He accused large construction firms of offering high prices for the property with which they retain the land, but did not use it, and asked Mrs. May to change the quotas for affordable homes in order to fix the "shameful housing situation" in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including housing controls and ending settlements for no legitimate reason.
He also wants the councils to give them greater powers to build new homes.
“Last year I said I will dedicate my prime minister to the return of the British dream, namely, to a better life for every new generation.
And that means repairing our disrupted housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work, and build life here.
However, it is wrong for people who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, to be able to buy homes in the same easy way as valuable British residents.
The dream of owning a home for many people has become too far away, and the humiliation of homeless people is too real.”
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to rule Scotland"
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, said his "final ambition" was to become the manager of Scotland's national club in the future.
The 42-year-old enjoys the challenge of reviving the Northeast club, which is currently third in the first league with only three points less than the top club.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after returning St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B hat and that's it," Ross told the Scottish "Sportsound" on BBC.
“But I grew up constantly watching Scotland in ‘Hampden’ with my father and always had something pulling me back.
However, such an opportunity could only be given if I’m successful in managing the club.”
Some of Ross' predecessors as managers of Sunderland are Dick Advokaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy King, Gus Poet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he didn't feel any anxiety knowing that he should follow such established names in such a big club, after he had previously rejected bids from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“My success is currently assessed by ‘Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?’
"Given the structure and facilities in this club, he is undoubtedly a member of the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not an easy task to get this club to get there, but I’ll probably think I’ve achieved success here only if I bring the club back there.”
Ross worked as a manager for only three years, in which career he entered after working as an assistant boss at Dumbarton and after a 15-month engagement as part of Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped "Alloa" recover from falling in the third league and returned "St. Mirren" from the edge of losing the championship title the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than when he played in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“That was probably a real crusade for me,” he recalls at the download of ‘Alloa’.
“I sincerely believe that a career as a manager is the right choice for me, a better choice than a career as a player.
It sounds strange because it went well for me, I made enough money from it and enjoyed certain high allowances.
But building a career as a player can be really difficult.
There are a lot of things you need to go through on a weekly basis.
I’m still going through certain things in terms of stress and pressure from work, but I just feel good in the role of manager.
“I’ve always wanted to be a manager and now I’m doing that, in this role I feel more comfortable than ever in my entire adult life.”
You can listen to the entire interview at "Sportsound" on Sunday, September 30 at "Radio Scotland" between 12:00 and 13:00 BST (British Summer Time)
According to a study, the perfect time for beer is at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer heatwave led to an increase in profits for British pubs, which are currently in a very difficult situation, but have put more pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures show that pubs and bars saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July, but restaurants’ profits declined by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of CGA’s business consulting services in determining these figures said: “Suntime and longer than England’s expected participation in the World Cup meant that the situation in July was similar to that in June, when profits fell by 2nd.
The 1.8 percent drop in sales in restaurants in June is even worsening in July.
The pubs and bars in which drinks are predominantly sold have seen a much higher increase compared to previous years, unlike restaurants where a decline has been observed.
The pubs where food is predominantly sold were also badly affected by the sunny periods, although not as dramatic as restaurant owners.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In successful pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6 percent during the month, and food sales by only three percent.
Paul Newman, RSM’s vacation and hospitality analyst, said: “These results follow the trend we saw at the end of April.
The time and impact of major social and sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to selling the market outside the home.
It is no surprise that restaurants are still in a difficult situation, although the 4.8 percent drop in sales over a year will be particularly striking as a complement to the current pressures that create the costs.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the owners of premises where food is mostly sold and the weather will show whether the more moderate temperatures we had in August will provide the much needed rest.
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including the newly opened ones, amounted to 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the stagnation in publishing new brands.

One in five children has a secret social media profile that they hide from their parents.
One study found that one in five children, some aged just 11, have a secret social media profile that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A study involving 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of “fake Instagram” profiles.
The news raised fears that sexual content is being posted on such profiles.
Twenty percent of students said they had a “main” profile that they showed to their parents.
One in five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, creates a social media profile that he hides from adults.
The study involving 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of “fake Insta” profiles, an abbreviation for the Instagram website where photos are shared.
The news heightened the fear that sexual content would be posted on such profiles.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean “head” profile that they showed to their parents, while also having other private profiles.
A mother who accidentally found the secret profile of her 13-year-old daughter found the same teenage boy who asked others to “violerate him.”
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and The Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in independent schools found that 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted that one of them was theirs.
HMC CEO Mike Buchanan said: “It’s really disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online profiles where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eled Doyle will be the “voice of the athletes” on Scottish Athletics’ board.
Eled Doyle was elected to the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics at the annual general meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is the most prestigious athlete in Scotland and President Ian Beethoven described the move as an excellent opportunity for those who are part of the leadership in this sport to take advantage of her broad international experience gained over the past decade.
“Everyone in the Scottish, British and world athletic community has a huge respect for Elid and we are sure that the athletes in Scotland would have a huge benefit if she became a member of the board,” Beethoven said.
Doyle said: "I am ready to be the voice of athletes and I hope I can really make my contribution and help in the right direction for sports in Scotland."
The American who won the titles of the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Games, in addition to the winning total of four gold medals at the Olympics, and who now regularly appears as a commentator for the BBC, could not go after he suffered a transitional bang.
He tweeted: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors told me that only time would show if I was recovering or to what extent.
The whole process was awkward, but I managed to fully recover, I can go again and do exercises for agility!
Thank you for your message of encouragement!”
Breast pump advertising in which mothers are compared to cows provokes division of opinions on the Internet
A company that manufactures breast pumps provoked a division of opinions on the Internet when it published an advertisement in which breastfeeding mothers are compared to cow molding.
To mark the launch of the product, which is said to be “the world’s most popular breast pump,” user-oriented technology company “Elvie” has released a funny ad inspired by the music videos to showcase the freedom that the new song has gained.
Four mothers are dancing in a cow’s pond full of breasts on a song that sounds like, “Yes, I’m molding milk, but you don’t see a tail” and “If you haven’t noticed this, it’s not a wrinkle, it’s my breasts.”
He continued: "Pump, pump, I feed the babies, pump, pump, I mold my breasts."
However, the ad that was posted on the company’s Facebook page has sparked controversy over the internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom said it emphasized the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
“A really bad decision is to use cows to advertise this product.
They, like us, need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, with the exception of the fact that their children are stolen from them just a few days after they give birth," said one of the comments.
"Elvie" breast pump discreetly fits into the breastfeeding system ("Elvie"/"Mother")
Another comment reads: “It is understandable that this is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But yes, why don’t you use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their babies?”
Someone else added, “Really inappropriate advertising.”
Others, in turn, defended the ad, and one woman admitted that she thought the song was really “funny.”
“I think this idea is a genius.
I would have bought a pump like this if I were still here.
It made me feel just like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I think it's honest.
It’s a brilliant product,” one of the commentators said.
Another commented: “This is a fun advertisement for mothers who mold milk (often in their workplaces or in the toilet) and feel like cows.”
This is not advertising that is lacking or condemning the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women discovered that they were dancing while the discreet pumps were blown into their breasts.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the belief that many women who use milk grinding pumps say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie's pump is completely silent, has no wires, no pipes, and discreetly fits into the breastfeeding sheath, giving women the freedom to move, keep their babies, and even get out of the house while sucking it.
Anna Ballarin, partner and RDR at Mother, commented: “Elvie’s pump is a truly revolutionary product and deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By setting a parallel between women molding milk and dairy cows, we wanted to mold milk with the help of a pump and the challenges that it brings to the same center of attention, while showing the incredible sense of freedom in a new way.
This isn’t the first time Elvie’s pump has been featured in all titles.
During fashion week in London, a mother of two children appeared on the fashion track for designer Marta Yakubovski wearing the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of migrant children detained has increased considerably, although border crossings on a monthly basis have remained relatively unchanged, in part due to the fact that sharp rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult for children to stay on board.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves were undetected immigrants and were afraid of threatening their own stay in the country if they asked to be a child’s sponsor.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would have to submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albens, a senior immigration and customs official, testified to Congress last week that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had no previous criminal records.
“Almost 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors illegally reside in the country and most of them are foreigners with criminal records.
That’s why we continue to chase those individuals,” Mr. Albens said.
In order for cases with children to be dealt with faster, the authorities have introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within one month of being detained, and not within 60 days, as the workers in the shelters say they had heard too much.
Many of them will appear through a video conference call, not in person, in order to bring their case to legal status before the immigration judge.
Those who are deemed unfit to receive relief will immediately be deported.
The longer the children remain in detention, the more likely they are to become upset and depressed, which can lead to violent outcomes or attempts to escape, the shelter workers say, and the reports that have emerged from the system in the last few months.
Lawyers say such problems have increased in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where due to its size, there is a higher likelihood of being neglected signs that the child is facing difficulties.
They added that moving the children to the tent town without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends can increase the trauma most of them are already facing.
Syria has told U.S., French and Turkish "occupation forces" to withdraw immediately.
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mu'alem called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Mu'alem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally residing in Syria on the grounds that they participated in the fight against terrorism and that "they will act accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and without setting conditions," he said before the assembly.
Mu'alem insisted that "the war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011 and millions have been evacuated from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue “to lead this world battle until we clear all Syrian territories” from both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, most of which are trained and advised by both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the territory of this country destroyed by the war.
With regard to the issue of refugees, Mualem said the conditions were good for them to return and accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that encourage refugees to stay away.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They politicize the issue that should be purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be provided with reconstruction aid until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said the recent deal between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib created an opportunity for progress in political talks.
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province where three million people live.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action will be directed at jihadists, including the Nusra Front fighters linked to al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated."
U.N. Representative Staffan de Mistura hopes that he will soon convene the first meetings of the new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition in order to draw up a constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mu'alem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the work of the panel should be limited to "considering the members of the current constitution," and warned of the consequences of further interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Mandate
According to that logic, Trump will again win the 2020 election unless impeachment and scandal prematurely terminate his presidential term, which is likely to be hoped by a large number of liberals.
In what will undoubtedly be “The Most Dramatic Final in a Presidency Ever Seen!”
From now on, there are no signs of fatigue in the audience.
Since 2014, the rating at the time of hit has more than doubled to 1.05 million in CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Nilsen says Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at the time of hit, which is 1.7 million more than it was four years ago, and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show has reached a top-rated cable rating of around 3.5 million views per night.
“This is like a fire that people feel attracted to because it’s not something we understand,” said Neil Baer, chief television producer of ABC’s “Designated Survivor” drama for a cabinet secretary who becomes president after being asked.
Neal Skovel, a veteran in comedy writing and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her she was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked why.
“He replied, ‘Because I think it’s really funny,’” Mrs. Skovel told me.
There is also some fun value throughout the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of the Roe vs. Wade case, whether immigrant families will be able to reunite, as well as the well-being of the global economy.
The exclusion from all of this is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you're no longer an uninformed citizen's shoe-to-shooter, and you've been watching a panel of experts for six hours discussing the use of a "deep background" source by Bob Woodward for his book "Fear," a bomber's leather jacket from him.

When I visited Mr. Fleas this week it was sunny and the temperature was 80 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kawai, but he was locked inside and watching MSNBC while filming on CNN.
He could not stop watching, at least not when Brett Kavanaugh had to face the Senate Justice Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was in a critical condition.

The Influence of Foreign Resources in the Thinest Medium-Term Elections in the Race for the Upper House
It’s no surprise that the 17th congressional district in Pennsylvania gets a large amount of funding thanks to the reorganization of the congressional areas from where there are two candidates in the race for the same place.
This recently reconstructed suburban area in Pittsburgh is nominated by Democrat representative Conor Lamb, who took a place in another area in the emergency elections last spring.
Lamb is competing with another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th congress area, and which largely overlaps with the new 17th congress area.
The maps were modified after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old areas were being manipulated in favor of Republicans, which is contrary to the constitution.
The race in the new 17th congressional area is a tough competition to fund campaigns between the main party sponsors, the Democratic Party's Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican Party's National Committee (NRC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after his close victory in the congressional elections for the 18th congressional district in Pennsylvania in March, which were characterized by widespread media coverage.
For more than a decade, this place was occupied by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won the area by a difference of 20 points.
Political experts give little advantage to the democrats.
The U.S. decided to punish El Salvador for supporting China, and then resigned
Diplomats pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing under little pressure from Washington.
In June 2017, Trump held a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela and owned a hotel in Panama until his partners evicted the Trump organization’s management team.
Officials of the State Department have decided to withdraw U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of "recent decisions to not recognize Taiwan's deputy president," said Heather Nauert.
But only with regard to El Salvador were penalties taken into account, which received US aid of around <0x24>140 million in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included a reduction in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have a detrimental impact on the country in Central America and high rates of unemployment and murder in the country.
As internal meetings progressed, representatives from North and Central America postponed the high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity in order to hold a similar meeting last year, which was considered to be a step forward in efforts.
But by mid-September, senior administrative representatives stressed that they want the conference to progress and effectively put an end to any reflection on the punishment of El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence should address the conference scheduled for mid-October as a sign of the importance the administration attributes to the meeting, diplomats say.
The three U.S. representatives quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing news of heavy messages or penalties from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on details of the debate that were described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal reflections on the state of anonymity.
Their views were supported by an external analyst who was close to the administration and who also spoke about the state of anonymity.
Learn the history.
The next thing that could happen is the publication of Special Adviser Robert Miller’s report on a possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, for which there is currently very solid evidence in public records.
Mr. Miller is also allegedly directing his investigation into whether Mr. Trump’s campaign is linked to Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the composition of Congress changes, Mr. Trump will have to take responsibility in that body as he prepares to reappear before voters, and possibly even before a court made up of his colleagues.
There is a lot of uncertainty here, and I don’t want to suggest that Mr Trump’s fall is inevitable, nor does his colleagues in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic must make certain choices that will affect the duration of this struggle.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to carry out a coup d'état on Hitler if the West opposed him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed to do so and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of massacres that followed.
The course of history revolves around such points of change and the uninterrupted march of democracy is accelerating or delaying.
Americans are now faced with a number of such changes.
What will we do if Mr. Trump resigns Deputy Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Miller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been on the hot seat since the newspaper announced that he had proposed to secretly shoot the president last year and speculated that he was unsuitable for the function he is performing.
Mr. Rosenstein said the information published in The Times was inaccurate.
“How will we act if the new investigation of Brett Kavanaugh requested by the FBI is incomplete or incorrect, or if he proves his innocence before the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will blame Mr. Trump?
If we fall on all these tests, democracy awaits a long winter.
But I don't think that's going to happen because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light candles for the Sabbath on a table with a swastika logo.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?”

Graham Dorans from ‘Rangers’ with optimistic stance on the collision with ‘Rapid Vienna’
The Rangers hosted the clash with Rapid Vienna on Thursday, and are aware that after the unresolved game against Vilarreal in Spain earlier this month, the victory over the Austrians will strengthen their position to qualify for the championship.
Graham Dorens, the midfielder due to knee injury, was prevented from appearing in the season until the unresolved 2-2 game with Vilarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a leap forward to greater achievements.
“It was a good point for us because Vilarreal is a good opponent,” said the 31-year-old.
“We went into the game believing that we could achieve something and came back with a winning point.
We might have given a little more in the end, but the unresolved result was probably a fair result.
They were better in the first half, and we did our best in the second half and we were better.
On Thursday, we have another big European night ahead of us.
"I hope we win three points, but it will be a tough game because they had a good score in the last game, but I'm sure with the support of the fans we will get a positive result.
“Last year was definitely a difficult year given everything that happened, namely my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is some positive factor in relation to the place.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it; the training is good.
"I hope we can go ahead now, leave the last season behind and achieve success."
Women can't sleep at night because of this fear of retirement savings.
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be concerned, few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the participants in the study conducted by Nationwide said they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“People want a member of their family to take care of them, but they don’t take steps to discuss the same,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of the life insurance company Nationwide.
Here’s where you should start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide care if you don’t share your wishes with them in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family and discuss where and how you can get care because such choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
Your choices for financing long-term care can include a traditional long-term care policy, a hybrid life insurance policy in cash value, which can help you cover the costs or provide yourself with your own funds.
Organize your legal documents: Avoid legal battles from the very beginning.
Take out full-fledged healthcare so that you can empower a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that healthcare professionals respect your wishes if you are not able to communicate.
Also, consider full-fledged about your financial resources.
In this way, you would choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and pay your bills if you are unable to do so yourself.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your older parent needs emergency medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about the medications you are taking and your allergies?
Note these details in a written form in order to be prepared.
“It’s not just about the finances, it’s about who the doctors are,” Martin asks.
“What are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make a plan like this.”
Man shot several times with an air rifle in Ilfracomb
The man was shot several times with an air rifle as he returned home from the exit.
The 40-year-old victim was found in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Police described the shooting, which occurred around 2:30 p.m. BST (British Summer Time) as an "accidental act."
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries were not life-threatening and the police appealed to the witnesses to help.
Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the number of deaths expected to increase.
Due to the interruption of communications, helpers are unable to obtain information from Dongala County, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-degree earthquake.
After the accident, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Below are some key facts about Palu and Dongal, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by the earthquake and tsunami.
Dongala is a district that extends over 300 kilometres (180 miles) on the coast in the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The county, which represents an administrative region within the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of income for the economy of the Central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Dongal.
Nickel mining is also an important activity in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Indonesia’s Disaster Relief Agency says that Palu and Dongal have been hit by a tsunami several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
The tsunami also hit West Dongal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years are:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of the island's coastline.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-degree earthquake hit the southernmost island of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that destroyed the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-degree earthquake hit the area near the city of Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people have died.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake hit one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami that reached 10 meters and destroyed dozens of villages, killing about 300 people.
2016: A tile-focused earthquake hit the Pidi Jaya district in Aceh, causing desert and panic as it reminded people of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
This time the earthquake did not cause a tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapsed buildings.
2018: Large earthquakes hit Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and prompted thousands of tourists to be temporarily trapped.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Trek Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Basila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in a report on domestic violence and opposition to arrest, according to a report released Saturday by police officials in Alaska.
According to the police report, when a woman's acquaintance tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes, he picked up her phone.
Palin is in Matt Sue's detention facility with a possibility of exit if he pays <0x24>500, KTUU reported.
On Saturday, he appeared in court, stating that he was "definitely innocent" when asked how he was pronounced before the court, the network said.
Palin faces three A-Class offences, which means he can be sentenced to up to a year in prison and a fine of <0x24>250,000.
He was also charged with a B-Class offence, sentenced to one day in prison and a fine of <0x24>2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called on police to report the alleged attack.
The case before the Alaska Veteran Court is pending.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interference in the report on domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of alcohol in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he allegedly hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she said her son's violent behavior stems from PTSD, a consequence of his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds Dead
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been discontinued, and the number of casualties is expected to increase in the coming days.
The quake struck the area near Central Sulawesi, which is located northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
On social media they circulate videos showing the moment of the blow.
Hundreds of people had gathered for the beach festival in Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutors Call for Rare Death Penalty for Suspect of Terrorist Attack in New York City
New York federal prosecutors are demanding the death penalty for Sifulo Saipov, the suspected terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people, a rare punishment not executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rented truck at Home Depot in October to attack a cycling trail on the West Side highway in downtown Manhattan and to overtake pedestrians and cyclists who were found on his way.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily injuries, according to a report on the intention to demand the death penalty delivered to the South District of Kentucky.
According to the court documents, there is a possibility to pronounce the death penalty on both of these grounds of the prosecution act.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal High Court launched an indictment against Saipov on 22 grounds, including eight murder charges for the purposes of retaliation, which federal prosecutors usually used in cases of organized crime, as well as prosecution and prosecution charges.
In order to carry out the attack, it took "detail planning and thought," the prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried out the attack as "horrible, cruel and misleading."
"Saifulo Habibulaevi<0xC4><0x87> Saipov's challenge, injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cléves, An-Laure Decath, Darren Drake, Ariel Erleigh, Hernández Ferrucci, Hernández Dañozáz, and Hernán Diego Mendoza."
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since a case of death in New York City's Southern District was prosecuted.
The accused, Calid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for July and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who was executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union for two years.
Both were sentenced to death by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
Police said he told investigators he felt good about what he had done.
According to the accusation, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
Police also said he had asked to place the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He said he was innocent on all 22 of the charges.
David Patton, one of the Allied public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, instead of accepting the confession of guilt and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of liberation, will only continue the trauma of these events for all those involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense had previously asked prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Tory MP Says Najgel Farage Should Be Responsible for Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage today during a protest at the Tory party conference promised to "mobilize the People's Army".
Former Ukip leader said politicians must "feel the warmth" of Euroskepticals, and one of May's deputies suggested he be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative supporter Peter Bonn at the Birmingham march said the United Kingdom would have been “outside the EU” if Farage was Brexit secretary.
But the challenge Mrs. May faces with regard to the reunification of her deeply divided members was highlighted by the anti-Brexit members of the Tory party who joined a special protest against Brexit that was taking place in the city.
The prime minister is trying to continue implementing the Chekers plan despite attacks by pro-Brexit people, anti-Brexit people and the EU.
The Allies insisted that it would continue its efforts to reach a deal with Brussels despite strong reactions and that it would force Eurosceptics and Labour Party members to choose between its package and “chaos”.
Bon told the pro-Brexit “Leave Means Leave” meeting in Solihaal that he wanted to “reject the plan from the Checkers.”
He suggested that Mr Farage should be involved and that he should be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been responsible for the negotiations, we would have been outside the EU by now,” he said.
Wellingborough spokesman added: "I will support Brexit, but we have to reject the plan from the Checkers."
Expressing his stance against the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars for now to be subject.
We want to create our own laws in our own country.”
Bonn rejected the suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely inaccurate.”
Andrea Jenkins, a member of the Tory and pro-Brexit party, was also present at the march and told reporters: “I’m just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not well-received by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not well-received by our party and our activists, who are actually those who go out to the streets and to whom our election wins.
Please give up the Chekers plan and start listening to us.”
In a message to Ms. May, she added: “The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Farage said at the meeting that politicians must "feel the warmth" if they intend to hand over the decision that was taken to the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to tell them, ‘We’re not going to let you get out of it.’”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the warmth.
“We are mobilizing the People’s Army of this country which has enabled us to win in Brexit and which will not stop until we become independent, self-governing and proud of the United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, the counter-Brexit people marched through Birmingham, before holding a two-hour meeting in the city center.
After the group's meeting, a small number of activists appeared this weekend wearing banners with the inscription "The Tyrians vs. Brexit".
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, laughed at the conservatives for the security issues they faced at the opening of the conference regarding the application created by the party.
"These are the people who tell us they can set up IT systems and all the technology they need for Canada plus, for borderless, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
“It’s a complete farce.
“There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to think well about running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would “think well about running for president” after the November election.
The Boston Globe announced that a representative of the Democratic Party of Massachusetts spoke about its future during a city assembly in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, an honorary critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Republican state representative Jeff Dil, who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She was at the center of speculation that she could replace Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters since Trump came to the presidency, with the holding of which she used a format of city assembly.
One of them asked if he was going to run for president.
Warren replied that it is time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes putting a woman at the top.
Suspect Arrested for the Shooting and Death of Basketball Player Sims from LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said on Saturday that the suspect in the shooting and death of basketball player Wade Sims of the LSU team that happened on Friday was arrested.
The Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of Deeton Simpson, 20, at a press conference at 11 a.m. Eastern time.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying the man from the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the campus of Southern University early on Friday morning.
"Wayd Sims had a gunshot wound in his head and as a result he died," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, 247sports reported.
Wade intervened to defend his friends and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being on the scene of the crime, possessing guns, and shooting at Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and detained in the Eastern Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
As a 192-centimeter-high junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, the Sims played in 32 games with 10 appearances of the previous season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 caught balls per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Louis Hamilton closer to the world title after the team with his orders secured him the victory over Sebastian Bethel
From the moment Walter Bottas qualified for Louis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes team's orders would play a major role in the race.
From the half-position Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton on the bench while defending his position in the first two rounds and inviting Bethel to attack his fellow player.
Vetel entered the boxing first and left Hamilton to fight with the band's end-to-end melting, something that was supposed to play a decisive role.
Mercedes entered the boxing one lap later and came behind Bethel, but Hamilton went ahead after one-on-one action that forced the Ferrari driver to unintentionally leave the inside of his free-risk ball to stay on the side after the double move to get all over.
Max Verstappen started in the back row of the net and on his 21st birthday at the end of the first round finished in seventh place.
He then drove most of the race and directed the tires of his car to quickly reach the finish and reach Kimi Raikkonen, taking fourth place.
He eventually entered the 44th round of boxing, but could not increase the pace in the remaining eight rounds, so Raikkonen came in fourth.
Today is a tough day because Walter has done a great job all weekend and he was a real gentleman who let me pass.
"The team has made a really exceptional decision to have a couple in the race," Hamilton said.
It was a really bad speech on the body.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diana Feynstein at the rally on Saturday over her insistence that she did not publish a letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which she accused the Supreme Court candidate, the White House.
In his speech at the West Virginia rally, the president did not directly refer to Ford's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate showed that people are "bad and rude and dishonest."
"There's only one thing that can happen, and the wonderful thing is that in what's happening in the last few days in the Senate you can see anger, people who are angry and evil and reckless and dishonest," he said.
“When you look at the publications and the leaks of information and they say, ‘Oh, it wasn’t me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember?
Diana Fynstein, have you posted this information?
Do you remember her response... did you publish the document -- "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
Wait a minute then.
Did we publish it... No, we didn’t publish it,” he added, imitating the senator.
A letter was sent to Fynstein with information about the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford in July, and the same was announced in early September, but Fynstein denied that the information leaked came from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t publish her story,” Feynstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep them confidential, and I did what she asked.”
But the president doesn’t seem to believe her denial, so she commented on the same at the rally on Saturday: “I’ll tell you one thing, it was a really bad body speech.
Maybe she didn’t do that, but it was the worst body speech I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court candidate, who has been accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president has suggested that Democrats use indictments to achieve their own goals.
“They are determined to restore power in any way.
You can see their wickedness, their subjugation, they don’t care who they hurt, who they need to tear apart to regain their power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: "Dundee Stars" 5-3 "Belfast Giants"
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants in the match against Dundee
The Dundee Stars compensated for the loss of the Elite League match on Friday against the Belfast Giants by winning a 5-3 rematch at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants were given an advantage from two goals scored by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bovilier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney took advantage of the host before Dwyer regaining the leadership of the Giants.
Francoa Bushar equated for Dundee to Lucas Lundwald Nilsen to secure their victory with his two goals.
This was the third loss of the season within the Elite League for Adam Kifi boys, who returned with a 2-1 win over Dundee in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth match between the two sides of the season, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's chance came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 a.m. with the addition of Kendal McFall, which addition was provided by David Rutherford while Bovilier doubled the lead four minutes later.
This was a quick opening of the match, Sullivan provided the host's lead with 13:10, before Matt Mercart assisted Cooney to reach the score at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead until the first break, when he scored the second goal for the evening at the end of the first period.
The host regrouped and Bushard returned them with a powerful game and goal, with a score of 27:37.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nilsen for the first time to secure Dundee's lead in the game late in the second period and he secured his team's victory in the last half of the fifth period.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will play their next game on Friday at home in Milton Keynes.
Flight Controller Killed by Helping Hundreds of People on Airplane to Rescue from Earthquake
A flight controller in Indonesia is famous as a hero after he died helping him on a plane with hundreds of people to fly safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many have disappeared after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong consecutive earthquakes continue to devastate the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues avoiding saving his own life, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Aung refused to leave his position in the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu, which was uninterrupted.
He remained in his position to ensure that the Batik Air aircraft with flight number 6321, which was at the time on the track, would fly safely.
Then, he jumped out of the control tower at the moment he thought the tower was going down.
He later died in the hospital.
Johannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision was likely to have saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“This news has broken our hearts,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of casualties could reach thousands, and the disaster relief agency says access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"It is believed that the number of victims is increasing because many bodies are still under the wreckage, while many cannot even be accessed," said the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
Waves of up to six meters have devastated Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are carrying aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Fast-time care brings body every minute.
There's not enough clean water.
“Minimum markets are plundered everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is quick to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
It’s already a tragedy, but it can get even worse.”
Indonesian President Yoko Vidodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the national army: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?” said CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Airplane crash in Micronesia: “Air Niugini” now says a man disappeared after a plane crashed in the lagoon
The airline that operated the plane that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says a man has disappeared after previously stated that the 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane that sank.
In a statement, Air Niugini said the male passenger could not be found since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline does not immediately respond to the passenger's requests for more details, such as his age or citizenship.
The local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuk Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
The cause of the accident, as well as the exact order of events, remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane had hit the lagoon near the track.
Some witnesses thought the plane had missed the track.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane flew very low.
“It’s an extremely good job,” Janes said.
Janes said that he and the others managed to cross the water that reached halfway through and point to the emergency exits of the plane that was sinking.
He said the stewards were in panic and screaming, as well as that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working near the harbour's reconstruction also helped rescue, with the help of an inflatable ship transporting people to shore before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the air safety network shows that 111 people have died in PNG-registered airline accidents in the last two decades, but none of them included the airline Air Niugini.
Analyst sets a time frame for the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor’s office concluded by presenting the case on Saturday for the retrial of the man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst from the U.S. Department of Justice, has witnessed for hours as an artificial in the field of intelligence analysis.
He pointed out to the court that he used phone records to link the movements of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Telis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers the night of her death, which is contrary to his previous statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time when he said it was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was questioned on Saturday and testified that that day was not in the city.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth by saying he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks after she died.
The phone records show that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted messages and calls from Chambers, as well as her contact information from her phone.
“He wiped her out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is expected to present its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the court to decide the case later on the same day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip-Hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to beat the negative attitude for this genre by incorporating positive messages into their music.
"The High Breed" from Bristol argues that hip-hop is far from its origin as music with political messages aimed at solving social problems.
They want to go back to its roots and re-popularize the conscious hip-hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced their revival through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
“Another black woman?”
A New York girl sues a married couple for being fired after sending a "racist" message
A New York girl is suing a married couple for being fired on the grounds of discrimination after she accidentally received a message from her mother who complained that she was "another black woman."
The couple denies that they are racist, saying that the lawsuit is actually “extortion.”
Linsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was disappointed when in 2016, after the first working day of the new nurse, Giselle Morris, she learned that she was a black woman.
“NEEEEEEEEEEE ALL ONE NORTH,” Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message sent to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Morris, twice.
After realizing what Plasco-Flaxman had actually done, she “feeling uncomfortable” dismissed Mrs. Morris, saying that their friendly nanny, who is an African-American, had done her job poorly, and that she had “expected the Post to give it away” instead.
Mrs. Morris was paid for her first working day and was then sent home to Uber.
Morris now sues the couple and seeks compensation for the <0x24>350-a-day dismissal, a six-month commitment that will involve her living with the family, what she was initially engaged to, but without concluding a deal.
“I want to show them that things like this should not be done,” she told The Post on Friday, adding, “I know that’s discrimination.”
The couple backed the allegations that they were racist, saying that the dismissal of Mrs. Morris was a reasonable procedure because they feared they could no longer believe her after she was offended.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t think about.
She's not racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you trust your children to a face to which you have been rude, even by mistake?
Your newborn?
Let's be real."
Saying the lawsuit was “extortion,” Plasco said his wife had given birth to the baby just two months ago and that she was in “a very difficult situation.”
“Will you attack someone who is in such a situation?
“It’s not too bad,” the investment banker said.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the public immediately condemned the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Publishers at Paddington fear readers will not be able to connect with the bear they speak to, reveals the new letter
Karen Yankel, Bond’s daughter, who was born shortly after the book’s acceptance, said of the letter: “It’s really hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it’s published.
It is very interesting that we now know all this about the huge success of Paddington.
After saying that her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before getting inspired to write the book from a little bear-shaped toy, would still be optimistic if his work was not well-received, she added that "the 60th anniversary of the release of the book was more than just a bear."
For Paddington, whom she describes as “a very important member of our family,” she adds that her father felt a silent pride in his potential success.
“He was a really quiet man and he didn’t want to be ashamed at all,” she said.
“But because you felt Paddington so real, it was almost like having a child who achieved something in life: and you’re proud of him even though success isn’t due to you.
I think Paddington’s success was perceived in this way.
Although it was a creation and a fruit of his imagination, he always attributed his merits to Paddington himself.
My daughter was on a deathbed and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
On landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life in vain.
“I had to call him regularly to tell me that the situation is very bad and that he is not expected to survive,” Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz said.
“Then Nad called me to tell me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
And I said, “Tashi, I really love you, my dear.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The effect of the medications that doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping slowly diminished, and they got out of her system.
She died earlier, and this meant that all of her systems were cancelling.
I just had to sit down and wait, aware of the fact that all this was happening.
I couldn’t scream, scream, or cry again because I was surrounded by family members and people.
I really had to stay home.”
Eventually, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz, mourning the loss of her daughter, got on the plane with the other passengers, unaware of the difficult situation she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“I shook my head and the tears didn’t stop.
It was hard to explain, but while I was on the plane, I felt immense sympathy for Nad.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I know how much you loved her.”
Lamented Women Put Cards on Bridge to Prevent Suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide are making efforts to stop others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys set up cards on the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to ask for support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parents to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Leeds, says her son had a great potential to become a cook, as well as a contagious smile.
“Everyone remembers his smile.
People have always said that his smile can light up any room.
However, he quit his job before he died because it was “in a really dark place.”
His brother, who was 11 years old at the time, was the one who found Tyler in 2014 after he took his life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly afraid that this will have a consistent effect."
Mrs. Davis makes the cards “to inform others that there are people out there who can talk to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
“Don’t sit still, you have to start talking.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who is a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, lost her partner Mark, with whom she was married for 15 years shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt unhappy or depressed, or he didn’t say anything,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He reached the bottom of the Christmas day when the children opened their gifts, and he did not look them in the eyes at all and did not make any contact with them.
She said his death was a huge trauma for all of them, but they must find a way to go through it: “Something like that ruins the family.
We're still broken.
But we have to go on and fight.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh has been uncertain since the FBI began the investigation.
"I thought that if we could actually get something that resembles what he was looking for, that is, an investigation with limited time, with limited scope, maybe we could achieve a little unity," Fleck said in a statement on Saturday, adding that he fears that the committee would "scratch."
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their hesitation is due solely to the timing.
The midterm elections should take place in just a few weeks, on November 6, and if Republicans are expected to fail, then they will be significantly weakened in their efforts to elect their man to the highest court.
George W. Bush calls the senators, while lobbying to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who, in turn, worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh could get at least 50 votes by voting in the Senate, allowing Vice President Mike Pence to change the unresolved outcome and enter the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees in North Korea "diminished" under Kim's leadership
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean envoy said.
Park Beyong-south, citing data from the Ministry of Unification of South Korea, said there were 1,127 border crossings last year compared to 2011 when there were 2,706.
Park said that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs on human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang did not comment publicly.
Most of the refugees from North Korea will be granted citizenship in South Korea on a timely basis.
Seoul says more than 30,000 people from North Korea have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, where the longest border with North Korea is located and which can be crossed more easily compared to the well-protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea.
China considers these people to be illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often repatriated them by force.
Relations between North and South, which are technically still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss issues that focused on halting denuclearization negotiations.
This followed a historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore where they generally agreed to work towards achieving the goal of the Korean Peninsula without nuclear weapons.
But North Korea's foreign minister, Ree Yong-ho, on Saturday accused the sanctions imposed by the United States of stagnating in progress since then.
“Unless there is trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such conditions we cannot unilaterally disarm ourselves first,” Mr. Ree said in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was not fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
The leader of the minority in the House of Representatives called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that, given his temperament, he was inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't have imagined that if a woman had acted that way, she would have said it was 'hysterical'," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when she was a teenager.
Kavanaugh was very emotional at his introductory exhibition, sometimes even screaming and licking while talking about his family and his high school years.
He also clearly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the allegations against him "a grotesque and coordinated destruction of his reputation" organized by liberals who are angry that Hillary Clinton lost in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes that Kavanaugh’s testimony is proof that he cannot serve in the Supreme Court because he has been shown to be biased against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clinton family and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi did not answer the question of whether she would try to remove Kavanaugh from office if the allegations against him were confirmed and if Democrats won the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say the following: if he does not tell the truth before Congress or before the FBI, then he is not only not fit to serve in the Supreme Court, but he is not fit to serve in the court where he is currently in office," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District Court of Appeals in Washington.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about the possible verdicts that Kavanaugh would make against the Accessibility Health Care Act or Roe against Wade, as he is considered to be the subject of conservative justice.
In hearings to confirm his candidacy, Kavanaugh did not answer questions about whether he would annul some of the Supreme Court’s rulings.
“Now is not the time for a hysterical, addicted man to come to court and expect us to say, ‘It’s really wonderful, isn’t it?’” Pelosi said.
Women should also use it.
It’s a really sharp criticism, months and years of accumulation of anger, which she can’t get rid of without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s unusual, do I?”
She continued, “A woman who was performing executive roles somewhere helped me a lot, who told me she was crying when she was angry, but she was able to develop her technique, so when she became angry and started crying, she told the person she was talking to.
I'm angry."
And then she keeps crying.
“I think that’s brilliant.”
Tears are allowed as an exhausted valve for anger in part because they are essentially misinterpreted.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first jobs in an office where men dominated was when I once began to cry with unspeakable anger and an older woman, a cold manager from whom I always had a certain fear, caught me by the neck and by the neck.
“Never let them see you crying,” he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll enjoy the fact that they’ve been able to touch you.”
Patricia Schröder was a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado at the time and worked with Gary Hart on his presidential nomination.
In 1987, when Mrs. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a ship called "Monkey Business" and retreated from the presidential race, Mrs. Schröder, deeply frustrated, realized that there was no reason she didn't think about the idea of running for president.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” he told me 30 years later with a laugh.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "The Snowman and the Seven Dwarfs."
Given the fact that the campaign had long been started, she did not have enough money, so she promised she would not enter the race if she did not raise <0x24>2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of her supporters who gave men <0x24>1,000 would only give her <0x24>250.
“Do they think there should be a discount for me?” she asked.
During the speech in which she announced that she was not going to start a formal campaign she was so dominated by emotion, that is, gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration from the system that made it so difficult to raise funds, not to pay, and not to target a voice.
“If you had seen me, you would probably have thought I had a nervous breakdown,” Mrs. Schröder recalled how the media reacted to the incident.
“You’d think Klinex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember wondering what they would write on my graveyard.
"She's crying?"
How the U.S.-China Trade War Could Be a Good Thing for Beijing
The opening of the fire with the onset of the trade war between the United States and China was staggering and although the battle is far from over, the conflict between the countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by taxing key exports to China, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The situation escalated considerably over the course of this week with the introduction of new tariffs on goods worth <0x24>200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively taxing half of the goods coming to the United States from China.
Every time Beijing returned to nature, it recently imposed tariffs of five to ten percent on U.S. goods worth <0x24>60 billion.
China has promised to return the U.S. to the same extent, and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will give up on it soon.
To force Washington to retreat means to accept his demands, but public worship in front of the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays well, the pressures from the trade war with the United States can result in positive support for China in the long run as it will reduce the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions for the start of a sudden economic downturn in any of the countries is much more dangerous than was previously established by a non-traditional amnesty that has been established by observers," said Abigail Gilbert.
Syria is “ready” for the return of refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is making efforts to help rebuild the country that has been devastated by the long war that lasted more than seven years.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
“Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safe, owing to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to restore areas devastated by terrorists in order to restore the situation to normal.
All the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to leave due to terrorism and unilaterally imposed economic measures that reflected their daily lives and lives have now been secured.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
An additional six million people living in the country need humanitarian assistance, the report said.
Al-Mu'alem said the Syrian regime welcomed aid in the reconstruction of the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe has achieved a significant victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the U.S. team in the Ryder Cup 2018 with a final score of 16.5 versus 10.5 in Le Golf National, outside of Paris, France.
The United States has so far lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup title in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its primate after Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored 14.5 points needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Michelson, who faced difficulties during most of the tournament, on his first hole hit the ball in the water in the par-3 of the 16th hole, losing to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has been featured in all rounds, becoming one of four players who have scored 5-0-0 since he started organizing the tournament in the current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spite lost 5:4 to the lowest-ranked player of the European team, Torbyorn Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the highest-ranked player in the world, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Polter from England, who may have played the last time in the Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran Sergio García, a participant of the eight Ryder Cups, became the European who won the most titles in the tournament with 25.5 points during his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t stop today.
This year has been really hard.
I am so grateful to Thomas that he chose me and that he believed in me.
I'm so glad we got the title back.
"The team play is the most important and I'm happy to be able to help," Garcia said after winning Europe.
He is now retiring from his compatriot John Ram, who one-on-one defeated Tiger Woods, the U.S. golf legend, with a score of 2-1.
"I feel incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him play," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods has lost all four games in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
This is an incredible statistic of one of the best players of all time, who won 14 major titles, ranking by Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team over the weekend tried to direct the game to the low-grass fields, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finnau, who played high-quality golf throughout the tournament.
The captain of the American team, Jim Furick, after his team's disappointing game, said, "I'm proud of these guys, they really fought.
This morning, we had a lot of trouble for the European team.
We were fighting.
It's downstairs for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played really well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the Association of Professional Golfers of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we're going to move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We have to admit to them.
We were overjoyed.
