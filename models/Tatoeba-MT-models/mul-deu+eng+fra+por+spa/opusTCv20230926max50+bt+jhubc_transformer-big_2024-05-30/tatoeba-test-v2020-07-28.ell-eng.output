"What would you like?" "I would like a dog."
You're working hard.

I want soup.
That's it?
Where did you get the key?
Is that probably not right?

It's from Greece.
Sometimes I understand you.
Tom's singing.
I love the taste of mushrooms.

When's your birthday?
I'm not your enemy.
I've asked Tom to sign the papers.
Save them.
Tom didn't want to touch it.
I brought you something.
I pretended to be asleep.
Our teacher is a real fool.
Tom wasn't ready to talk about it.
We've been tortured.
Tom's been impressive.
Mary is cautious with strangers.
We'll shoot.
I'm sorry.
Where's the exit?
It was dark when I got home.
Life's hard.
Who's Tom talking about?
Your father won't buy them.
Tom knocked on the door.
That's where I live.
I hope you'll call me again.
Are you sure I'm the only Canadian here?
Talk more slowly.
Put the book on the others.
The bird is in the sky.
Tom's hired Mary.
Mike, how's it going?

We only have three choices.
The moon is behind the clouds.
You need to talk to Tom.
Tom worked in Australia. He worked in Australia.
I want the money.
Tom's roaring.
Don't turn off the lights.
He was very happy.
Thomas, apparently, was unhappy.
You're not a teacher?
Tell him we're busy.
Tell her to help us.
Tom insisted.
Thank you, you're fantastic!
Is Israel going to attack Iran?

You're new?
I remember that word.
I'll decide.
Tell them you're not ready.
I showed her my room.

He tried to write a story.
What are you gonna tell them?
Where are you going?

I saw her take it.
I like sports. I like sports.
I've got money.

I don't think it's good for you to date him.
I'm not going to tell anyone about you.
Tom's been singing some old songs.
Whose pen is this?

I have to limit the costs.
Where have you seen these women?
I don't want to kill myself.
Do you have tickets left?
Tom's frightened.
Even though Tom's happy.
You were so happy.
He told me an interesting story.
I'm usually walking.
I've been walking for over four hours.
Are you sure I'm the only Canadian here?
“How are you?” “I’m fine, thank you.”
I found her letter in the mailbox.
I was helped by my coach.

Did you dye your hair?
I've got ten pennies.
How deep is it?
He likes music.
Don't they look happy to you?
We were able to see the sunset from the window.
Once I was thirsty, soft water.
These aren't fish.
Tom wins.
He didn't come to the last meeting.
I want to leave Boston. I want to leave Boston.
He doesn't speak many languages.
We're gonna have to talk about this.
That's gonna hurt a little bit.
I swim once a week.
I broke my leg.
Who saw you?
Somebody poisoned them.
I drank the wine.
I've been waiting.
I guess I'm a good driver.

You should've thought about it from the beginning.
How's the wife?
We're fine now.
I want a lot of things.
You're a good journalist.
I’ve read this book three times.
That's my wife.

He's studying law at the university.
Tom answered.

I like to study French, too.
Where's the cook?
Tom's walking slowly.
The game is made of wood.
Do you like the summer?

How old were you when you left Australia for the first time?
The knife on the table wasn't sharp enough for the meat, so I used my sock.
I was lucky.
You're impatient.
He has a white dog.

What exactly did you tell them?
Would you like to get started?
I would like to learn all of the European languages.
What is he going to order at the restaurant? I was thinking about something in a sushi.
You have to listen to me.
Stop resisting! Stop resisting!
Tom and Mary could've done it by 2:30 if they had worked a little faster.
Tom knew I was busy, he knew.
We'll find it.
I'm curious.
I'll eat here.
That's a Japanese doll.
He took out his glasses.
It's good to dream.
He had a headache.
Which one of them is mine?
Tom doesn't speak French.

You underestimated me.
Totally symptomatic, these two are still under repair.
Dancing.
I wasn't angry.
That's not my key.
You're doctors.
My decision to study abroad surprised my parents, and I was surprised.

Tell them you'd like to leave.
Do you think this is a game?
You're better than her.
We'll follow you.
This morning I lost the train, which I usually take.
He was trying to kill me.
He's lost his sight.
It's worth a try.
I'll be here.
Shall we go to the movies?

I'm still looking for Tom.
What did they say?
Do you need them?
He's leaving for Tokyo tomorrow.
Bigfoot is not a pet, first of all, he doesn't like to be called a bigfoot.
Tom wanted the answers.
They just left.

Tom's good at cooking.
He's bargaining.
Do you have a tattoo?
This is unprecedented.
"Can I help you?" "No, thank you, I'm just silly."
Mary's been protecting her husband.
You're not Japanese.
Muffler!
Tom's been quiet.
They say you can usually judge people from the company they have.
We don't have anything.
My shoes are bigger than yours.
I'd like you to be at the meeting tomorrow.
We like the music.
Can you lower the intensity a little?
I don't have a girlfriend.
The news made them happy.
I went to visit her in Germany.
Tom's already gone home, but Mary's still here.
Tom's drinking coffee.
We're not hungry.
We've all made a mistake.
This weekend, we can make a free phone call for you.
You don't have brown eyes.
I wanted to die.
Where's your wife?
You've been watching?
I can read without glasses.
Tell me your address.
We have what we deserve.
Let's talk about it.
You don't trust me, do you?
It's my job to teach English.
This brings me great joy.
Tell them I'm not gonna do this.
I like Boston so much.
I'd like to help you.
She's cutting me off.
You'll be safe with Tom.
Try to convince him to help us.
Excuse me, do you speak English?
You're late last night.
We're students.
Why are they angry?
I hope it went well.
I'm human.
Everybody likes the money.
Tom's talking to Mary.
Tom did a lot of great things.
There are five fish in my aquarium.
Tom's not driving fast.
Thomas is smarter than Mary's.
The pen is on the desk.
Are you going to stay?
Tom and I are getting married in October.
Sit down!
I love gardening.
Who were you talking to?
You need to sleep.
Who broke it?
What's your complaint?
Apparently, Tom's busy.
Wait for me there.
Why don't you help me?
You think you can catch me?
Tom planted three apples in his yard.
Tom claimed that he was innocent.
Smile.
Your face's red.
You're not ready.
Tom and Mary are coming here now.
You're not Canadian.
He said something.
She advised him to take the medicine.
Tom's my older brother.
Don't underestimate me.
The sofa is uncomfortable.
I'm a great soul.
Are you sure that Tom's not busy?
Who's sick?
Thomas's got a Turkish friend.
I like jazz.
Tom's got a sharper mind.
Are you sure you pressed the right button?
Good evening!
Are you satisfied?
We sent the products yesterday.
You'll be jealous.
You have something on your teeth.
How often do you wash your clothes?
Tom's got high moral standards.
I accept threats.
Tom was wearing gloves.
Tom pardoned Mary.
Tell them who we are.
You went to the casino.
Don't be afraid to make a mistake when speaking English.
I can't help you this week.
You shouldn't say things like that when there are kids around.
I'll never forget you.
I thought you were Canadians.
We recognized them.
I heard the news on the radio.
Do you miss Tom?
His wife doesn't even know why he's dead.
You have to watch this movie.
Driving safely. Driving safely.
Tom knows I'm Canadian.
I lost my card for lunch.
There was no time.
After the accident, the injured were taken to the hospital.
We've got to finish it all by Monday morning.
We have to work very hard.
As you like!
Who are your parents?
I was playing tennis.
And besides, I don't like to wear socks.
We're both planning on attending your party.
Thank you so much for coming!
Tom was singing.
He's a dancer.
What did you ask him?
He's running now.
It's too spicy for me.
What I want now is a glass of cold water.
We'd like to order 18 tons of olive oil.
Tom's handling the French pretty well.
Why did you shoot her?
Let's go on.
I want to talk to my lawyer.
She likes the flowers.
I think they're liars.
This elevator can carry ten people at a time.
Freedom is not free of charge.
He's teaching us French.
You're sick!
You think I'm a dictator?
I'm the only one who doesn't want to do it.
We have to hurry to get to the station in time.
What are Tom's priorities?
Tom's got a brother in Boston.
I want to talk to you.
Tom has decided to go to Australia.
Tom didn't want to do it.

It's cold; why don't you put on a sweater?
We'll save you.
Are you ready?
Only for adults. I'm sorry.
I don't know her.
Tom was in love with Mary.
He wanted to see his boss in Tokyo before he left for America.
Come on in early.
How many letters did you send to Tom?
I've been seeing him for months.
I forgot her nickname.
I want you to go back to Boston.
They're insane.
You're a liar.
We're not guilty.
I'm drinking milk.
I admire you.
I didn't go to the zoo.
These are my favorites.
One speaks english and the other speaks japanese.
When are you planning to get married?
They're writing.
What can I do about it?
I can't imagine what it means to be there.
He was an Englishman.
I had no doubt about it.
I'm not tired at all.
She's beautiful.
What do you want me to tell you?

The roads are covered by snow.
Well, I have a suggestion to make.
I don't remember the exact date.
He's smart.
What are you gonna tell them?
He's quitting smoking.
When are you having dinner?
Would you like a glass of red wine?
He only drinks water.
I can't forget her beauty.
Do you wash your hands before eating?
Tom's playing tennis.
Everyone has secrets.
Don't lie to me again.
I don't have a fee.
I like to help other people.
What kind of animal is big?
I'll wait until October.
Do you know how to use it?
They're lucky.
The decision is mine.
You want to tell her?
You hid the truth from me.
His answer was no.
I understand them.
You're still alive.
How old is she?
Tell her not to come.
Is Tom really a Canadian?
Tom plays tennis every day.
It's not cheap.
She's a very attractive woman.
Passion becomes a lesson.
How can we make it happen?
Do you think you could help me take care of the garden this afternoon, huh?
I can't eat pork.
You're very brave.
It's on the eighth floor.
I want to go to Korea.
Tell Tom I'm swimming.
I want revenge.
I'm tired.
Dinner's mine today.
We're willing to negotiate.
The girl wants to know the truth.
Have I ever asked you to work on Sundays?
I feel guilty.
I've gone to sleep.
Follow him. Follow him.
I'd rather have coffee.
There's medicine.
It's unlikely he'll be here today.
My father hasn't had dinner yet.
Melanie thinks the situation is very bad.
Tom ignored Mary's warning.
He's become rich.
My girlfriend's Canadian.
If I weren't a dishwasher, I'd buy it.
Wait for us here.
"Do you speak English?" - "Not yet, this is my first lesson!"
We're gonna die if we stay here.
Do you want to eat shrimp?
I have a friend.
She didn't understand Mary's joke.
Will you tell them?
She's very slippery.
Who brought you here?
We had our holidays at the lake.
Who's locked the door?
Are you sure you don't want me to talk to Tom about this?
Go get my wife.
Hang your clothes here.

Tom bought a brand-new car.
Tom has a lot of debt.
You don't have a way.
Why are you smiling?
Didn't I tell you not to close the door?
Please don't touch me.
I got you a present.
You're not poor.
We're going to visit Tom.
My colleague and I are doing the same job, but they promised him promotion very soon.
Does she like oranges?
Are you mad at me?
You have to write a letter.
Tell her I'm ready.
I'll wash the dishes.
I like the snow, it's so nice!
Tom's seen Mary today.
I was born in Boston.
They believe me.
You killed her.
They'll find her.

We murdered them.
You're so beautiful!
Tom's a celebrity.
Tom says he's in need of help.
Why did you shoot them?
It took a lot more than I expected.

Don't make a noise!
I swim once a week.
Tom's smarter.
Tom's started it.
Tom doesn't know where to wait for Mary.
I'm still in love with Tom.
That's an unlikely result.
I like it and I need to learn a lot of foreign languages.

We shot him.
You got three cars, right?
Tom's gonna find us.
It's up to you.
I don't remember inviting you.

Where'd you put it?
Doctors have a difficult problem.
There are three shops in the mall.
Keep digging. Keep digging.
I like to help other people.
I need a hydraulic.
Are you sure you don't want me to talk to Tom about this?
Yankee was greatly influenced by Borekh's story.
I don't like them.
He must be an American.
When do we have to deliver the report?
Who stole Tom's bike?
We don't want it.
This room is used as a kitchen.
Who are you referring to?
Somebody's singing.
How many sprinkler rolls did you eat?

If you really want to know, all you have to do is ask.
Who's that girl?
Ignore them.

I'm diabetic.
He's kicking me!
When was the last time you smoked?
We've all agreed with Tom.
Tom's house is close to the beach.
We're going to build a wall.
This tea is good.
That's the last warning.
Give us three minutes.
You'll learn to speak English fluently!
Fantastic!
Say it in Hungarian!
I know his address, sir.
I want to know when the meeting will start.
I know he's lying.
Actually, you're absolutely right.
Do you like white chocolate, huh?
Snakes are reptiles.
Are you sure I'm the only Canadian here?

Can you see the stars tonight?
Ask him when the next plane is going to leave.
You're lively.
Look around. Look around.

That's the absolute truth.
Did he admit it?

Well, Tom really wants to help out.

He's a coward, isn't he?
What are you going to eat today?
Tom's a Canadian.
Kissing?
We've been warned.
Tom's got a lot of brains.
Wait here. Wait here.
In his eyes, it was perfect.
Can you find him?
He is strong, brave and, above all, kind.
They're Canadians, aren't they?
I'll teach you French.

I'm not very good at that.
I was hoping to see Tom.
We're all Canadians here.
Tom made some mistakes in the test.

Honestly, I don't like it.
Tom's going to obey.
Were you alone?
We need more drivers.
I think you're on the right track.
It makes me laugh.

Where does he live?
When are you coming?
We're ready to help.
Are you ready?
Let's get them out of here.
