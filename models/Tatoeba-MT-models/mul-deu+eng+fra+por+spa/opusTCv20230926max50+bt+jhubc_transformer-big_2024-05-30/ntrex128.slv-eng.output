Members of the Vali<0xC5><0xBE>an congregation worry that they are “like Muppets”
Some members of the House are appalled at the proposal to rename themselves MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was due to the plans to change the name of the assembly to the Vali<0xC5><0xBE>an Parliament.
Members of the Assembly throughout the political spectrum are concerned that they will smile.
A member of the Labour Assembly said that their group was concerned about them “because the name of the rhyme is Twp and Pwp.”
For readers outside Wales: in Val<0xC4><0x8D>ian twp means stupidity, and pwp means cacao.
A member of the party, Plaid Cymru, said that their group as a whole was "not satisfied" and suggested other options.
A Vali<0xC5><0xBE>an conservative said his "open-spirited" group had a change of name, but at the same time pointed out that there was a small difference in pronunciation between the words MWP and Muppet.
In this context, the pronunciation of the Valysian letter “w” is similar to the pronunciation of the letter “u” in the Yorkshire proverb.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently preparing a draft legislation to introduce name changes, said: “The final decision on possible descriptors for members of the Assembly will of course have to be taken by the members themselves.”
The Government of Wales Act 2017 authorised the Walloon Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposals and received broad support for the appointment of the Vali<0xC5><0xBE>an Parliament.
For the members of the Assembly, the Commission chose the name ‘Welsh Parliament Member’ or ‘WMP’, but received the most support in public consultation with the option ‘MWP’.
Members of the House obviously propose other options, but reaching a consensus will be a difficult task for President Elin Jones, who will have to submit a bill on amendments within a few weeks.
The Reform Legislation will also include other amendments to the functioning of the Assembly, including rules on the incompatibility of the functioning of the members of the Assembly and the formation of a system of committees.
Members of the Assembly shall participate in the legislative debate in the final vote on their appointment.
Macedonians will decide by referendum to change the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday to change their country’s name to “Republic of North Macedonia”.
By voting, they want to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of their northern neighbor represents the right to their territory and has repeatedly opposed its requests for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, the opposition to the name change plebiscite, said he would not take into account the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is the price they have to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Church are shattered as churches in Harlem face problems
“The older people I’ve been talking to say that sometimes there were bars and churches in every corner,” Adams said.
“Today, neither one nor the other.”
He explained that the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
“People are socializing differently today.
The bars are no longer the living room of the neighborhood where people regularly go.”
In churches, however, he is concerned that money from the sale of funds will not take as long as leaders expect, and that they will soon be back in the beginning.
He added that churches could be replaced by residential buildings with a common administration (condominiums) where people will live who will not help shelters in the remaining neighborhoods.
“The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and therefore the day soon will come when all these churches will be closed, because it is unlikely that the people who move into these condominiums will become members of these churches.”
Both churches built the Belgian religious communities before Harlem became the black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin’s decades later.
The original Belgian Methodist church community emigrated in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by a black religious community who was performing worship in the vicinity.
St. Martin’s took over the black religious community under the leadership of Honourable John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of sellers who didn’t want to hire or support the Dark Poles on 125th Street, Harlem’s main shopping street.
The fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Johnson's father's parishioners planned a renovation, they ordered bells to ring.
Honoring David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin’s Church, he proudly called the bells “the bells for the poor.”
In July, an expert called them a little differently: "cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Expert Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also pointed out that these were the first bells to be played by a dark pole musician, Dionisio A. Link, who went to the Riverside Church 18 years ago, where he clings to larger bells.
Mr. Merriweather said he was not replaced in St. Martin's Church.
In the last few months, the church of St. Martin’s has a complicated story with architects and contractors; some have been brought by church laymen and others by the bishops.
Zachrytia – the governing body of a parish composed of lays – wrote to the bishops in July that she was concerned that the bishops would “try to transfer the costs” to the parish, although the parish was not included in the employment of architects and contractors sent by the parish.
Some parishioners complained about the transparency of the diocese.
Sea Dog Injures 13-Year-Old While Hunting Almonds in California
Officials say a California shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while hunting sharks at the start of the shark hunting season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon’s Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had dive with friends about half an hour in the morning on Saturday when he heard a boy screaming for help, then swam to him with a group and helped pull him out of the water.
Hammel said at first that he thought the boy was just excited because he caught a shark, and then he found that he was screaming “He bit me!
He bit me!”
When he reached the boy, Hammel noticed that he had a broken whole key.
“I told everyone to go out of the water and say, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Council Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he remains in critical condition.
The species of the shark responsible for the attack is not known.
The water rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, said in a statement to the media that a few weeks earlier they had spotted a shark in the area, but it was found that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe injuries to the upper part of the body.
Responsible for 48 hours have disabled access from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami’s Beach in Ecinitas for research and security.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to enter UK beauty market
Sainsbury’s comes to Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with the beauty corners they have in stores, and with professional staff.
As part of its entry into the UK beauty market, worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and still growing, while the sales of clothing and household appliances are falling, larger beauty corners will be tested in 11 stores across the country, and next year in more stores if they get out of handcuffs.
They decided to invest in beauty products because supermarkets are looking for ways to fill the shelves they used in the past for TVs, microwaves and household appliances.
At Sainsbury’s, they say they will double their range of beauty products to 3000 and include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing range of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees brands will also gain more space in areas with brands similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket also revives its boutique range of cosmetic products, so most of the products are vegan – something that younger buyers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, fragrance shop will test the concession at two Sainsbury’s stores. The first opened in Croydon, South London last week, and the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham by the end of the year.
Due to online shopping and the daily purchase of smaller amounts of food in local stores, supermarkets need to work harder to convince people to visit.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said retail stores will be like grocery stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight off Aldi and Lidl discounts with multiple services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s has opened outlets in hundreds of stores and also the Habitat store, since it bought both chains two years ago, which increased food sales and acquisitions were more profitable.
Previous attempts by a supermarket to renovate their cosmetic and pharmaceutical departments have ended unsuccessfully.
Sainsbury’s started a joint venture with the Boots chain in the early 21st century, but the connection ended after a dispute over sharing profits from drug stores in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sold its pharmaceutical company for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
Lloyds is expected to play a role in this plan, expanding its range of luxury skincare brands in four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury’s, said: “We’ve changed the look and impression of our beauty corners, thereby improving the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available for advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all the needs, and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now an interesting beauty destination that is a challenge for the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'shocked' for Holly Willoughby's <0xC2><0xA3>11 million retirement
The star shows Dragons Day (Good Business) angry after television director Holly Willoughby retired from the <0xC2><0xA3>11 million business with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for their brand of clothing and accessories Truely.
Business couple companies were compared with the brand Goop Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old actress announced on Instagram that she would retire.
Holly Willoughby was furious with Dragons star Den Petr Jones as she resigned from their lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "crazy" when a gold girl on television on Tuesday during a tense meeting at his company headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that due to her new jobs — worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million — she hasn't had enough time to devote herself to her bad habits.
The company was compared to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow brand and predicted it would double its assets, estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving the brand Truely, Jones flew out of Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source says: “Truly was by far the most important thing for Holly.
That would be her long-term future, with which she would spend the next two decades.
Her decision to resign completely amazes everyone involved.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, as the opening was so close.
At the headquarters of the company in Marlow is a warehouse full of goods ready for sale.”
Experts believe the company’s departure from This Morning, one of Britain’s most interesting banking associations, would make millions due to large investments in products, from pillows and candles to clothes and accessories, as well as additional opening delays.
It can also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughbyeva, the mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been good friends with Jones and his wife Taro Capp for ten years.
Willoughby was founded by Truely with Cappo in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones joined them in March as president.
The couple spent their holidays together, and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin’s television production company.
Willoughby will become M&S's ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his business affairs.”
A hard conversation “and then we fell in love”
He was joking about criticism from the media over comments that some consider "non-presidents" and positive opinions about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump, with his ridiculous “journalist” voice, said:
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He pointed out that Kim had shown interest in the second meeting. Their first meeting in Singapore in June, Trump marked as a major step towards North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at a UN General Assembly meeting that North Korea saw no “adequate response” from the United States to previous North Korean disarmament measures.
Instead, he stressed that the United States is continuing with sanctions that continue to put pressure on it.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
“We’re doing great with North Korea,” he said.
“We wanted to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have a good relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had brought positive results – they stopped testing the missile, helped liberate the hostages, and brought home the remains of American soldiers.
He also defended his unusual approach in talking about relations with Kim.
“It can be very presidential, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded scene, we have 200 people standing here,” Trump said, pointing out to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island, hundreds dead
For example, in addressing the consequences of the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told not to need their help.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok have been displaced, they have not declared a natural disaster, which is a condition for sending international aid.
“In many cases, unfortunately, it was very clear that they did not require international assistance, so the situation is somewhat complicated,” Sumbungova said.
Save the Children is a team that will travel to Palu, but it is not yet clear whether foreign staff will be able to help on the ground.
Sutopu, a representative of the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu and assessing whether international agencies will be allowed to help.
Given that the earthquakes in Indonesia are permanent, the country remains completely unprepared for the anger of nature.
In Aceh, shelters were built after the tsunami, but this is not a common practice on other coasts.
The apparent absence of a warning siren for the tsunami in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life, despite the warning.
Traveling through many Indonesian islands is a challenge even at the best of times.
Because of natural disasters, logistics is even more complicated.
The hospital ship, which is anchored in Lombok to help the victims of the quake, is heading towards Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of a new disaster.
President Joko Widodo put the improvement of Indonesia’s destroyed infrastructure at the forefront of his election campaign and spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the financial deficit is a problem for the Jok administration in the re-election next year.
Yoko is also facing pressure from long-standing tensions between sects in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands evacuated from their homes because Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.

Daniel Sturridge on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London with an 89-minute shot to save Liverpool from defeating Chelsea in the 1st English League.
Sturridge accepted the offer of Xherdan Shaqiri a good 25 meters ahead of Chelsea's goal with his team's 1-0 draw.
You put the bullet on your left and fired a shot at a distant gatekeeper.
The shot was travelling high above the criminal premises towards the upper right corner of the neck.
In the end, the ball dropped through the goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalage and fell to the goal.
“I was simply trying to get to the right position for the ball and players like Shaq are always pulling it forward as much as I can, so I was just trying to get as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming, so after one touch I didn’t think much anymore and I just decided to shoot.”
Chelsea led 1-0 in the semi-finals with Belgian player Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues attacker gave the ball back to Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> in this fifth round and slipped into Liverpool's half.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> quickly stepped in the middle and glazed forward.
Then he passed through the defense nicely, and Hazard invaded the prison.
Hazard jumped over the defense and shot a left foot against a distant goalkeeper through Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Naples at San Paolo Stadium in Naples on Wednesday at 3 p.m. in the Champions League group stage.
On Thursday, at 3:00 p.m. in London, Videoton will play in the Europa League.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, the state agency said on Sunday morning.
A spokesman for the agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, told a news conference that many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings due to Friday’s 7.5 earthquake, which triggered six-meter waves.
The fire, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is ravaged by the demolition of buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was beaten to death
Police have launched a murder investigation after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
A 44-year-old with intruders was found at 7.55 p.m. in the Grayson Mews building on John Street and arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder.
Police are calling on anyone in the area who has seen or heard anything to make a statement.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is at an early stage, but I call on all those who were near John Street in Birkenhead and who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also call on everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught something on camera footage, to contact us, as they may have information that is crucial to our investigation.”
A police official confirmed that the woman was a resident of Birkenhead and the body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman came to the crime scene and asked where they found her this morning.
Investigations are taking place, and police are informing the women's families.
The taxi driver, who lives in Grayson Mews, was just trying to return to his apartment, but police told him no one was allowed to enter or exit the building.
When he found out what had happened, he was speechless.
Residents are now told that it may take several hours before they can re-enter.
Policemen heard him explain to the man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene, all in tears.
He continued, “That’s so terrible.”
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were inside the cordon, and another one just outside it.
Numerous policemen stood inside the cordon and watched the block of the house.
Anyone who has any information requests to write to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and provide log 247 dated September 30.
Cromwell's statue in parliament became the latest commemorative target of the "rewriting of history" dispute
His removal would be a poetic right to destroy many English cultural and religious artifacts by fanatic puritanism adherents.
But the Cromwell Society has labeled Crick’s proposal as “stupidity” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In today’s discussion about the removal of statues, it became clear that the image of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would become the target.”
Iconoclasm in the English Civil Wars Cromwell neither ordered nor carried out.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor from the last century.
The great presentation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a 19th-century opinion and is part of a personal history that some believe is still worth celebrating.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is seen by many (perhaps even more in the late 19th century than today) as a protector of parliament from external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate presentation is the subject of continuous historical discussions.
It is clear that in the middle of the 17th century the dispute shaped the further development of our people, and Cromwell is a recognizable individual who represents one side of this division.
His achievements from the time when the Lord was a protector also deserve to be celebrated and remembered.”
Suicide pig kills Chinese farmer to death
According to local media reports, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwestern China.
The man, identified only by the nickname “Yuan”, was found dead with a carved artery and covered in blood near a pig’s market in the town of Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The pig breed is preparing for the vaccination of pigs on a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
According to the report, she and her cousin were expected to travel from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead, and the door of the neighboring pig was opened.
He said there was a big male pig with a bloody mushroom in the pork.
A forensic investigation confirmed that a 250-kilogram pig killed a farmer.
“Brother’s legs were bloody and blurred,” a cousin named “Wu” was quoted in Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed that Yuang came to the market at 4.40 p.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that attacked Yuan was neither his nor his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up so as not to attack anyone else while the police collected evidence on the scene.
Yuan's family and market leadership are expected to negotiate compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks on humans have already been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, where the man suffered severe bodily injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-kilogram pig squeezed a whale farmer by a tractor, but then the woman drove the animal away.
After the pigs were eaten by a farmer from Oregon in 2012, another farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that the pigs are usually non-aggressive, but the taste for blood can act as a “provocator.”
“We would just play.
They're like little children, very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
We just need to show them enough respect,” he said.
In the southwest of the U.S. due to Hurricane Rosa remains, heavy rains are coming
Hurricane Rosa is moving towards the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico and weakening.
Rosa, however, will bring flooding to the north of Mexico and the southwest of the United States in the coming days.
Rosa is a Category 1 hurricane with wind speeds of 137 km/h from 5.00 a.m. on Sunday morning, and is located 620 kilometers southwest of Mexico’s Eugenia Point.
Rosa is expected to move to the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean, a low-pressure area is strengthening, moving east towards the US west coast. Rosa will approach the Peninsula of Baja California on Monday as a tropical storm and will push high tropical humidity north to the southwest of the US.
Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical moisture, which will mix with the low air pressure area, will create abundant rainfall in the wider southwestern area in the coming days.
Locally between 25 and 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous flooding, deposition of floods and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
Due to high tropical humidity, rainfall in some places will be around 50 to 75 mm per hour, mainly in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwestern parts, especially above most of Arizona, 50 to 100 mm of rainfall is expected.
Floods are possible due to the rapid deterioration of the situation due to the dispersed nature of tropical rain.
It would be very reckless to walk in the desert when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into rivers, and storms will bring local heavy winds and dust into the air.
The approaching low air pressure area will bring local rainfall to parts of the southern coast of California.
Rainfall above 12 mm is possible, which can result in less deposition of floods and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall for the region during the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical surfaces will begin approaching Arizona on Saturday late afternoon and on Monday early in the morning, and on Monday late and on Tuesday the rains will spread.
Heavy rains will spread across the sky on Tuesday and will continue on Wednesday.
In the U.S. there can be large temperature drops in October, as the Arctic cools, and tropical areas remain quite warm.
Sometimes this causes dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
Sunday is an excellent example of the dramatic temperature difference in the central part of the United States.
There is a 20-degree difference between Kanas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
In the next few days, summer temperatures will try to settle and expand again.
Most of the middle and eastern U.S. will enter in the warm October with temperatures around 27<0xC2><0xB0>C from the Southern Plain region to parts of the northeast.
In New York, it could be 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows good chances for temperatures above the eastern average in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have watched Brett Kavanaugh’s interview.
More than 20 million people on six television networks watched an interesting testimony Thursday by Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman accused of sexual assault that was supposed to occur in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political stance continued as television stations interrupted the regular program due to Friday’s last-minute transformation: an arrangement sought by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, namely that the FBI would conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Justice Committee that she was 100 percent convinced that Kavanaugh was guilty of raping her and trying to kill her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in a bullish testimony that he was 100 percent sure that this did not happen.
Nielsen reports that more than 20.4 million people are expected to witness on Friday.
The company counted the average viewing of the television networks CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for other networks that played witnessing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some problems with counting spectators watching the program in the offices.
For an easier performance, viewing is similar to playing a football match finale or awarding an American Film Academy award.
The Fox News Channel, whose directors strongly support Kavanaugh’s nomination, plays a full-day hearing in front of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers, reports Nielsen.
In second place is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers, Nielsen reports.
Interest remained high even after the hearing.
Flake played a central role in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office said he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS on Friday morning cameras recorded screaming at him as he tried to get into the elevator to attend the hearings of the Justice Committee.
During the construction, he took a few minutes to watch, which was captured live by CNN television house cameras.
“I’m standing here before you,” said a woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?
You have power, while many women are helpless.”
Flake said his office had filed a statement, and added that he would say more at the committee hearing, and then the door of the elevator was closed.
All television networks were broadcast live even hours later, when the Justice Committee voted to deliver Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so if they agreed that the FBI would investigate charges against the candidate next week, which was called by a minority party of Democrats.
Flakes were partly convinced by talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's vote was decisive, as it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to appoint Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an investigation into the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May Accuses Criticism of ‘Playing Political Games’ in Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of “playing political games” with Britain’s future and undermining national interest.
The arrival of British Prime Minister Therese May at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with her in the newspaper’s headline, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson staged his attack on her so-called Brexit plan from Chequers and said the proposal for Britain and the EU to pay each other’s tariffs was “absurd.”
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police Arrested Dyteon Simpson Suspected of LSU Player's Death
Police have arrested a suspect in a fatal shooting at Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player in the LSU.
According to police reports from Baron Rouge, 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned on second-degree murder charges.
Officials posted a video of the Sims-Simpson confrontation, and police said the Sims lost their sunglasses during the fight.
The police found sunglasses on the scene and on them Simpson's DNA, CBS is supplementing WAFB's reports.
After Simpson's interrogation, police filed a statement saying he confessed to shooting Wayde to death.
The mortgage is <0x24>350,000, the lawyer says.
A spectator from East Baton Rouge Parish has issued a preliminary report on Friday stating that the cause of the death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The police thanked the special units for refugees of the Louisiana State Police, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the South University Police and the residents of the area for their assistance in the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU sports team director Joe Alleva thanked the local prosecution authorities for their "concern and legal search".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 201-centimeter attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for the LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 leaps per game.
On Friday morning, LSU coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"That's what you're worried about all the time," Wade said.
A volcanic ash blast in Mexico City
The ashes vomited by the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern neighbourhood of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center on Saturday warned Mexicans not to approach the volcano as activity in the crater has increased and recorded 183 emissions of gas and ash in 24 hours.
The Center observed several cases of bushings and earthquakes.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash covering windshield cars in neighborhoods of the capital city of Mexico, such as Xocchimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometres southeast of the capital, after a 7.1-degree earthquake in September 2017 struck central Mexico.
The volcano, called Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of independence vote
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after protesters, who supported independence, confronted anti-aircraft police units and thousands of people joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the Catalan polarized polling.
A group of masked supporters of separatism, who were detained by anti-aircraft police units, covered them with eggs and metal powder paint, creating dark dust clouds on the streets, usually flooded with tourists.
Later there were also disputes, whereby the police had to use pencils to stop the clashes.
Proponents of independence, who shouted for hours “without forgetting, without forgiveness,” faced protesters who supported unity and shouted “Live Spain!”
According to local media, 14 people in the protests suffered minor injuries.
A year after the October 1 referendum, which was declared illegal in Madrid and was celebrated by Catalan separatists, tensions in the region that supports independence remain.
The vast majority of voters voted for independence, although participation was low, as opponents of the secession largely boycotted the election.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempted to halt the continuation of votes in the region in violent clashes.
Groups supporting independence have camped in front of the electorate overnight to prevent demonstrations and thereby support the state police.
The demonstrations continued, but they had to take another path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hoped that Catalonia would become independent.
“We had one of our best moments last year.
I watched my parents cry out of luck because they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite significant, albeit close victories in the regional elections in December last year, Catalonia’s independence-sponsored parties have found it difficult to maintain the initiative this year, as many of the most well-known leaders in the voluntary expulsion or detention are awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the referendum.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded protests in support of police on the phone, explained that the protest was supported by politicians on both sides.
“The tension is increasing,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in detention since the end of last year before the start of the trial, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
“Candidating for the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression in democratic values and the oppression we have seen in the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Arrested Men Who Cracked a Car Into House
Three men, aged 33, 34, and 39, have been arrested for having repeatedly crashed into a Londonderry house.
The incident took place in Ballyngard Crescent Street on Thursday at around 7:30 p.m.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the door and the building were damaged.
At some point, they were also shot at the car with a sniper.
With Menga's hit, Livingston won 1-0 against the Rangers.
Dolly Menga with her first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livingston surprised the Rangers and Steven Gerrard had to admit his second defeat in 18 games as Ibrox club coach.
Dolly Menga's shot made the difference as the Gary Holt team matched the Hibernian team in second place.
Gerrard's team thus remained without a guest victory in this year's championship, and the Hearts, who lead the team on the scale, are waiting for them next Sunday, with eight points behind them.
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingston increased his series of defeats in the division in six games and head coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, has not yet tasted the defeat.
Livingston Wasted Opportunity Against Direct Guests
Holt's team should have been leading long before hitting, as they caused a number of problems with their immediate rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to break through, but he sent the ball across the door frame, then Alan Lithgow hit past the goalkeeper, and Craig Halkett shot his head over the goal.
The hosts left the game to Rangers because they knew that they could be dangerous to guests when interrupting the attack.
And that's how they got to the key goal.
The Rangers gave Livingston a free shot and Declan Gallagher and Robinson prepared an action for Mengay, who shot and shot from the middle of the prison.
The Rangers had a bigger possession of the ball, but they couldn't beat home defenses and goalkeeper Liam Kelly didn't have much to do.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly's defense.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor defended Scott Pittman with his leg, and Lithgow fired away from another Livingston break in the attack.
The proposals continued to come to the Livingston Penalty, but the locals rejected all the attacks, and two offences – Halkett’s offense over the replacement of Glenn Middleton and the offense for the hand game – were not convicted by the judge.
“Excellent performance” by Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont (BBC Scotland) at Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and result for Livingston.
They were all great, and they continued to surpass expectations on their way upwards.
The style and attitude of the game have not changed much since their return to the top, but Holt has to be credited with the way he awakened the team from his arrival.
There were a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett played an extremely important role and deployed a well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on hand all the time.
The Rangers were simply lacking inspiration.
Although under the leadership of Gerrard they are exceptional, they are very lacking in these standards.
There was a lack of shots at the goal – only once successfully defeated the hosts’ defense – and it was a kind of wake-up call for the Rangers who were in the middle of the ladder.
Erdogan in Cologne accepted mixed
On Saturday (September 29), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin, smiles and the blue sky prevailed.
Today is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
There have been controversies about human rights, freedom of the press and Turkish accession to the EU.
Erdogan then travelled to Cologne to open a giant new mosque.
The city is home to the largest number of Turkish population outside of Turkey.
For security reasons, the police prevented 25,000 heads of the crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters managed to get closer to seeing their president.
Hundreds of protesters – many of them Kurds – have also expressed their opinions, who do not support the Erdogan government and have condemned Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to greet him in the country.
Opponent protests reflect the segregation of the visitor, which some German Turks celebrate as heroes and others despise as autocrats.
Road Accident in Deptford: Bicycle Accident Killed in Car Racing
In London, a cyclist was killed in a race involving a car.
The crash occurred near the intersection between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, on a traffic road in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 UTC.
The driver stopped and rescuers arrived, but the man died at the end of the accident.
The accident occurred just a few months after the cyclist died in a collision, in which the driver of the car fled, on Childers Street, about 1.5 km from Saturday's accident.
Police said police were checking the identity of the man so they could notify the family.
They set up road stops and redirected bus lines, and advised motorists to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Guards Injured in Crash
Six prison guards were injured in a raid in a strictly protected male prison, the prison administration said.
The riot broke out at HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at about 9:30 a.m. British summer time and is still taking place.
Police officers from the “Tornado” unit were called to take care of the incident, in which eight inmates participated and were confined to one wing.
The guards were treated with minor injuries to the face at the end of the day.
The prison staff representative said: “We have called on specially trained personnel to take care of the execution in HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six members of the staff suffered injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that the police will be responsible for it, and they may be behind bars as a result.”
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison administrator was in hospital care for being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, an anti-aircraft police unit was called to jail to intervene in a severe outburst in which staff attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (which may be useful for dry areas)
Tropical depression rarely reaches Arizona, but this is likely to happen at the beginning of next week, as the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa slows its way through the southwest of the desert and brings the danger of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of sudden flooding for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is said to be raging over Phoenix on Tuesday, and will be approaching late on Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of a tropical storm or depression within 300 kilometers of Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) raged about 60 kilometres from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 50 to 100 mm of precipitation with individual precipitation up to 150 mm at Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
In other areas of the southwestern desert, including the Rockies and the Great Basin, 25 to 50 mm of rainfall is expected, individual rainfall up to 100 mm is possible.
For areas beyond the danger of sudden flooding, Hurricane Rosa may be a real blessing as the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of the rainfall is likely to be useful, as in the southwest there is currently a drought period.
“According to the American drought tracking center, a good 40 percent of Arizona experiences the least extreme drought,” reports weather.com.
The route of Hurricane Rosa first leads to the mainland of the Mexican Peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa, which still has hurricane power on Sunday morning with the highest wind speed of 137 kilometers per hour, is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moves north at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm will come into contact with colder waters in the Pacific and therefore weaken.
It is expected to reach mainland Mexico with the power of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rainfall in parts of Mexico can be abundant and therefore pose a high risk of flooding.
“From the Baja California Peninsula to the northwest of Sonora, we expect 75 to 150 mm of precipitation with the possibility of 250 mm of precipitation,” said weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical hurricane before reaching the Arizona border early in the morning on Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then travel through Arizona and towards southern Utah until late on Tuesday night.
“The greatest danger we expect from Hurricane Rosa or its remains is abundant rainfall on the Baja California Peninsula in the northwest of Sonora and in the Southwestern Desert of America,” the National Hurricane Center said.
These precipitations can cause life-threatening sudden flooding and flooding in deserts and landslides in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempt to Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after they found a 16-year-old with intruders in Somerset.
A wounded teenager was found on the Excelsion Terrace in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at around 4:00 a.m. in British Summer Time.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition remained “stable.”
The 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old were arrested at night in the Radstock area, police from Avon and Somerset reported.
Police are calling on anyone who has caught the incident on a mobile phone to call.
Trump Says Kavanaugh "Passed the Unkindness and Anger" of the Democratic Party
“The voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against recklessness and unheeded Democratic Party tactics,” Trump said at a conference in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “suffered the outrage and anger” of the Democratic party in the process of his appointment.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, clearly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations of sexual assault decades ago when she was a teenager.
At the hearing, Ford also spoke about his allegations.
The president said on Saturday that the day “the Americans saw Kavanaugh’s brilliance, quality and courage.”
“The voice for the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is the voice for the appointment of one of the best legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an exceptional record of public service,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly mentioned Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke of the importance of Republican election participation in the interim elections.
“Five more weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.
I’m really trying to get a candidate,” he said.
That’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere.”
Trump says Democrats are on a “dispute and obstruction” mission.
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to take place no later than Friday, a Republican party advisor told CNN.
Hundreds of people killed in Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, death toll rises
Authorities reported on Saturday that at least 384 people were killed in the earthquake and tsunami that hit Indonesia's island of Sulawesi, many of whom were transported by giant waves that flew off the coast.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when six-meter-long waves hit the coast in the dark, killing many and destroying everyone on their way.
Tsunami was followed by a 7.5-degree earthquake.
“When the threat of a tsunami arose yesterday, people stayed on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they became victims,” Indonesian disaster relief agency BNPB Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a meeting in Jakarta.
“Cunami didn’t come alone, he pulled cars, trees, houses, he threw everything on the ground,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was traveling overseas at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
He said some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami, and they survived.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photos published by the disaster agency show destroyed buildings and shops, wrecked and broken bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Earthquakes continued to hit the coastal town on Saturday.
In the area of 2.4 million people, there have been a series of earthquakes.
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Use of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released in Friday's powerful earthquake was about 200 times the power of the Hiroshima atomic bomb in World War II.
The geography of the city, which lies at the end of a long and narrow bay, is expected to further increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been destroyed.
He also said that the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the ruins of buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho explained that the casualties and damage may be greater off the coast 300 km north of Palu, in the Donggala area closer to the epicenter of the quake.
As Nugroho also said, communications are completely interrupted and have no information from the Donggal area.
“There are more than 300,000 people living in the area,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that staff and volunteers are moving to the affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, but it can get even worse,” he said.
On Saturday, the agency received numerous criticisms as it did not inform the public that the tsunami had affected Pala, but officials say the waves arrived just at the time of the warning.
In an amateur video posted on social media, it is heard as a man on the top floor yells at the people on the street in an imminent tsunami.
In a few minutes, the water wall ran off the coast and brought with it buildings and cars.
They could not immediately verify the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage that disrupted communications around Paluj, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
Authorities report that the military has started sending cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees still need food and other basic supplies.
The city airport was only open to provide assistance and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit an evacuation center in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll in the Indonesian tsunami has risen to more than 800.
It's very bad.
According to Mr. Dosebe, members of the World Vision organization from Donggale safely arrived in Palu, where the staff set up a shelter in front of their premises, but saw numerous scenes of devastation along the way.
“They told me they saw a lot of ruined houses,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even when aid groups initiated disaster relief initiatives, some complained that foreign humanitarian workers with extensive experience were not allowed to arrive in Palu.
In accordance with Indonesian regulations, overseas financing, stockpiles and staff assistance are only allowed if the site of the accident is declared as a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It is still being treated as a provincial disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says ‘okay, this is a national disaster’, we can accept international aid, but such a status is not yet.”
On the second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and relatives of the missing hold the hope that their close wonders in the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, they pulled the boy out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days while her mother's body was lying next to her.
Gendon Subandono, Indonesian sailboat team coach, trained two missing sailboats for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
The other, caught in the Roa Roa hotel, were, according to Mr. Mandagi, his students.
“As mayor in the field of sailing, I bear my emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls that in the hours when news of the Roa Roa hotel’s collapse was circulating around the community of sailboats, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to competitors in Palu who attended the beach festival.
But his messages were marked with only one gray wrist, instead of two blues.
“I think that means that the messages weren’t delivered,” he said.
Tattoos stole <0x24>26,750 while filling ATM in downtown Newport on the Levee
According to Newport police, dads stole <0x24>26,750 from Brink's security worker, who filled an ATM in downtown Newport on the Leeve.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver the money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While employed, another man “approached Brink’s security officer from behind” and stole a bag of delivery money.
Witnesses reportedly saw several suspects fleeing from the scene, but the police did not specify the exact number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about the identity of the suspects should call the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changed his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
The change was posted on Twitter on Saturday, saying: “A bell with the official name Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has also used it as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes just before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, in which he is due to present his new album Yandhi.
He will replace the singer Ariano Grande, who canceled the performance for "personal reasons," the show's creator said.
The word shortens his current professional name, and West has already said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, meaning ‘you’,” West said earlier this year when he spoke about the title of the album with radio host Big Boy.
“So I am you and I are all of us.
Kanye, which means “one,” I transformed into Ye – that reflects our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is a reflection of everything we are.”
Kanye is one of many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was named Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, and this year he expressed a desire for the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former co-worker, JAY-Z, also used his name differently; with or without thought and in capital letters.
Mexican President AMLO pledges not to use military force against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has sworn he will never use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody violence against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would “never use the army to suppress the Mexican people.”
At a time when leftist student movements began to operate in Latin America, peaceful demonstrations on the market on October 2, 1968, soldiers began shooting and killing 300 people.
Lopez Obrador has sworn to support young Mexicans and students to provide monthly grants and to open several free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education are dragging young people into criminal societies.
The U.S. should double its funding for artificial intelligence.
As China is becoming more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the resources it spends on research in the field, says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI expert who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments come after various parts of the U.S. government announced the use of artificial intelligence, although the U.S. has no official AI strategy at all.
In the meantime, China unveiled its plan last year: its goal is to become the best in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
“A doubling of the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are pretty much for the United States and we are looking for the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence,” Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the chances that the next major artificial intelligence achievement will take place in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by publishing house Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, chairman of Sinovation<0x2B> Fahcid, is one of the largest companies in the world.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon University developed an Artificial Intelligence system that defeated the highest-ranked American player Othello, and later became CEO of Microsoft Research and chairman of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee said he was familiar with previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the robotics competition organized by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and asked when the next one would be easier to find the next visionaries.
Researchers in the U.S. have to work hard if they want to receive state support, Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes over the best academics, but they’re companies,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been hiring the best of the university in recent years to develop artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the United States strengthen its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think we should automatically offer people with a Ph.D. in artificial intelligence a green card,” he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese government issued a development plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China finances people in academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations allocate money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is poor, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, bringing together industrial and academic partners, and the White House announced the establishment of a new committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a <0x24>2 billion investment in the AI Next initiative.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) currently invests more than <0x24>100 million a year in AI research
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation, which wanted to create the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence, hasn’t done anything for months.
Macedonians will decide to change the name of the country in a referendum
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum on Sunday to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia" to resolve decades of dispute with Greece, which opposed their requests for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia, insists that the name of its northern neighbor represents the right to their territory and has vetoed its accession to NATO and the EU.
The governments reached an agreement on the basis of the proposed new name in June, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would destroy the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonians.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in a referendum, and the boycott campaign expressed doubts that participation would be at least 50 percent if necessary for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum was: “Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the adoption of an agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is the price worth paying for joining authorities such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the disintegration of Yugoslavia.
Today I have come to vote for the future of the country and for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the guise of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us,” said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough MEPs have said they will respect the outcome of the vote, which will be decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The National Electoral Commission said no irregularities were reported by 13:00.
However, participation was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters cast their vote.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter from the capital city of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Du<0xC5><0xA1>ko handed out their ballots for a referendum in Macedonia on 30 September 2018 to change the name of the country that would pave the way for NATO and the European Union to join.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small orchestra and placed chairs in front of tents set up by those who would boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads raised, not through the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring a much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I believe the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after his ballot.
He added that the positive result would be “confirming our future.”
A poll published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research last Monday showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, which is less than the electoral vote required.
Another survey conducted by Macedonian television Telma showed that 57 percent of the respondents would vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the voting must be 50% plus one vote.
An unsuccessful referendum would be the first major blow to the pro-government policy that took office in May.
Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero overplayed Brighton’s entire defense and hit
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling played Brighton's defense at Manchester City 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero's hit in the 65th minute seemed ridiculously easy.
At the start of the action, the Argentine attacker received a message in the middle of the playground.
He ran between three Brighton defensive players and found an open space.
Aguera was then surrounded by four green players.
He overplayed one defensive player and was faster than others on the edge of Brighton's criminal space.
Then he gave Sterling to his left.
The English attacker, with his first touch in the penal area, returned the ball to Aguer, who defeated Brighton's goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with his right foot and sent the ball to the right side of the net.
"Aguero is facing leg problems," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We agreed to play for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to have scored a goal at the time.”
But Sterling was the one who gave the son the blues an initial lead in the Premier League duel.
He scored a goal in the 29th minute.
In this action, Aguero took the ball deep on Brighton's half.
The ball on the left gave it to Leroy Sane.
Sane touched the ball several times and then sent the ball to Sterling against a distant goalkeeper.
The attacker of the blue-skins punched the ball into the net just before it flew out of the nude.
City will meet Hoffenheim at Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany on Tuesday at 12.55 p.m.
Scherzer wants to play against the Rockies and ruin their title options
The Nationals are out of the finish line, so there is no special reason for a new attack.
But always competing Scherzer hopes he will be able to climb the metal hill against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday. This will only happen if the Rockies still have the opportunity to play in the final, as they have a game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western League.
On Friday, the Rockies secured the least invitation from the organizer with a 5:2 win over the Nationals, but are still awaiting their first title in the division.
"Although we can't get anything, at least we'll be able to play in a great atmosphere in front of a lot of people here in Denver and the opposing team will play at probably the highest level this year.
Why don’t you want to compete?”
The Nationals have not yet released the names of the first metallurgist for Sunday, but it will likely be Scherzer metal in this case.
Scherzer, who will be the first metal as early as 34, will be a metal player on Thursday and will have enough days of rest by the end of the week.
Washington's right-wing scored 18 wins and 7 defeats this season with an average of 2.53 runs and 300 knockouts in 220 2/3 changes this season.
Trump at Congress in West Virginia <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The president indirectly touched on the situation regarding his election to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke of the importance of Republican election participation in the interim elections.
“Everything we’ve done is going to be at stake in November.
Five more weeks to one of the most important elections in our lives.
It’s going to be one of the biggest — I’m really trying to run for a candidate, so I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere,” he said.
Trump continued: “We have this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, and this is happening now.
They are determined to re-take power, using all possible means, and you can see dishonesty, evil.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to do to gain power and control, because they want it, power and control, but we won’t give it to them.”
In his words, the Democrats are on a mission of “discussion and obstruction.”
“And you may have noticed this in the last four days,” he said, denoting the Democrats as “hurtful, evil, low, and lying.”
He highlighted the name of the Justice Committee member, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, with loud disapproval from the public.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you publish the document?
Um, um, what.
No, um, no, I didn't, wait. It was really a bad body rumor, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer open to different views.
To those who express their opinions, she is impatient.
When the Momentum activist in my local party spoke out against me, it was not a surprise.
After all, I am the last in the ranks of Members of Parliament from the Labour Party, who are not wanted to express our opinion.
The same thing happened to my colleague, Joan Ryan, because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, it was a mistrust proposal for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar issues, on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The meeting of the Labour Party in Nottingham East on Friday stated that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
In the eight years I was a member of the local Labour Party parliament, Friday meetings were mostly just like this.
Unfortunately, this tone is not used in most meetings today, and the promise of a “friendly and gentler” politician has long been forgotten if it ever started.
It is becoming increasingly evident that different views in the Labour Party are not permissible and that each opinion is assessed as to whether this is acceptable to the leadership of the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, and my colleagues, who I used to think we share similar political views, were expecting me to change my mind and take positions that I would never otherwise agree with – whether it be in the field of EU security or national security.
When I speak in public – and it really doesn’t matter what I say – they follow criticism on social networks that call for non-election, condemn the politics of the environment, and tell me that I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And that's not just my experience.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because my comments are only political.
I admire the expertise and determination of those colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist insults on a daily basis, but are not afraid.
One of the most regrettable aspects of this policy period is how the rates of abuse have become something quite common.
Jeremy Corbyn explained last week that the Labour Party must promote a culture of tolerance.
But the reality is that we are no longer open to differing opinions and with every proposal of distrust or change of rules for choosing a customer becomes more narrow.
Over the past two years, I have received a lot of advice to bend my head and not to be so loud, but to be “all right” with me.
But I didn’t get into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago – the reason for this was the negligence of Tatcher’s government, which literally left the classroom in my elementary school – as a local councilor or a government minister, I have tried to take on better public services, most of which are needed.
I have never concealed my political beliefs, including the last elections.
No one in the Nottingham East party could have been confused because of my political positions and areas that I did not agree with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I just want to say that I do not understand their desire to waste time and energy to discuss my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party at a time when the country is swimming against a Brexit that will affect households, businesses and our public services.
But my true message is not for the Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters and voters, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to have served you, and I promise you that no threat of inequality or political suitability will distract me from all of this in my best interest.
Chris Leslie is a member of the Nottingham East party.
Ayr 38:17 Melrose: unconquered Ayr on top of the ladder
Two well-known experiments have slightly distorted the final score, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved a win in this wonderfully entertaining championship game of the day.
Now they're at the top of the scale and they're the only unprecedented team of ten.
In the end, the weightlifter transferred their top defense to the homepage and better take advantage of the opportunity, and coach Peter Murchie had a good reason to be happy.
"We have passed a lot of tests in our matches so far and we are still unbeaten, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “Congratulations to Ayra’s team, the opportunities have been better than us.”
Grant Anderson's attack in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, led Ayr to the lead, but the yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, which he received in a game with the Warriors, meant a numerical overpower for Melrose and Jason Baggott crossed the test.
Climo increased his lead for Ayr at the break before hitting right at half-time and then converted a standalone test to a 17:5 score for Ayr at the break.
But Melrose started the second half very well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, converted by Baggot, reduced the retreat to five points.
She followed a long break due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, which they carried on the carriers, and then Ayr advanced with Stafford McDowall's attempt, which Climo transformed.
Interim captain Ayra Blair MacPherspon then received a yellow card, and Melrose again took advantage of the game with the player more with Bruce Colvine's unconverted attempt at the end of a period of violent pressure.
But the hosts came back and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for obstructing the Clima without the ball, MacPherson scored a hit in the attack.
Climo scored points after Kyle Rowe shot David Armstrong and sent wing actor Gregor Henry in the fifth host attempt.
Star of the Still Game series starts a new hospitality career
Still Game star Ford Kieran apparently goes to hospitality,at least to become the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old in the popular BBC series, for which he also wrote the script, plays Jack Jarvis with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that after the upcoming ninth season is the last, and it seems Kiernan is already planning a life after Craiglang.
According to the official documentation, the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the stories, but a source told the Scottish Sun that Kiernan wanted to be part of the “flowering hospitality” in Glasgow.
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, hopes the court will reopen its way to the Pacific
Marines patrol at the navy headquarters in La Paz.
In public buildings, the Navy's blue flags are isolated.
The sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are covered with the slogan: “We have a right to the sea.
It is our duty to bring it back.”
In mainland Bolivia, the memory of the loss of the coast in a bloody dispute over natural resources with Chile in the 19th century is still alive – as is the desire to renew the Pacific.
This hope is perhaps the greatest in decades now, as Bolivia is awaiting the decision of the International Court of Justice, which will be received after five years of consultations on 1 October.
“Bolivia has a drive, a spirit of unity and impartiality and, of course, a positive spirit awaits the outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country and hope that the court in The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia, which insists that, after decades of unstable talks, Chile must negotiate access to access to the Bollywood.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, who awaits next year’s controversial re-election battle, also has high expectations for Monday’s verdict.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will not decide in favor of Bolivia – and even if it did, it would not change much.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has not authorised Bolivia to allocate Chilean territory, and will not decide on the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the decision of the International Court of Justice comes only six months after hearing the concluding arguments means that the case was “not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And for the last four years, they have not spoken in favor of Bolivia, but they will probably cost it a lot.
“The current Bolivian government has taken advantage of the question of access to the sea,” Zaratejeva said.
Morales’ aggressive rhetoric squeezed out of the Chileans all the goodwill that might have remained, she explained.
The talks between Bolivia and Chile will continue at some point, but after that it will be extremely difficult to participate in the discussions.
They have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltsé, the Bolivian representative in The Hague, has rejected the idea that the court took the decision unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring an “extraordinary opportunity for a new period of relations with Chile” and the possibility of “ending 139-year-old disagreements with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the most popular Latin American presidents – used the maritime issue as a political support.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific,” he added.
“A decision is an opportunity to anticipate that we must overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won’t happen if it can’t trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never be the first to destroy their nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
Ri made a speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfill its promises made at a meeting between the leaders of rival states in Singapore.
His statement comes at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is apparently ahead of a reboot of nuclear diplomacy, which was at a dead end, more than three months after meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri says the United States is wrong if it thinks the continued sanctions and the agreement to predict the end of the Korean war will put North Korea on its knees.
Washington is cautious in affirming the forecast, without Pyongyang taking decisive disarmament measures first.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump are looking forward to another meeting.
But there is a general doubt that Pyongyang is thinking seriously about the arms cessation, which the state sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare everything for a second meeting of Kim and Trump.
At fashion magazines in Paris, unveil the latest line of huge covers coming to stores with affordable brands near you
To supplement your collection of covers or completely hide from the sun, you do not need to look forward.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled in their collections for spring and summer 2019 on the fashion track a collection of strange oversized covers that blinded the style of the Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical covers flooded Instagram this summer, and designers sent their spectacular creations to the fashion track.
The most prominent piece of Valentine’s Day was a beige hat with wide cakes decorated with feather-like accessories, in which the heads of models were completely lost.
Other oversized fashion accessories included lubes with precious stones, a magic hat and even pineapple – but your heads won’t warm up.
Thom Browne also showed a selection of bizarre masks – just the right time for Halloween.
Many colored masks have sewn lips and are more similar to Hannibal Lecter’s masks than high fashion.
One creation was similar to the equipment for diving with a breather and glasses, and the other looked like a corneal with melted ice cream.
And if you want to follow fashion, you are lucky.
Fashionable connoisseurs predict that the giant covers will come to the stores near you.
Wide hats closely follow "La Bombi", a slender hat with 60-centimeter-sized nappies was spotted on Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski, among others.
The cult brand for an extremely impractical hat that has flooded social networks has sent another great creation on the fashion path – a straw bag for the beach, which was almost as big as a model in the bathtub she wore.
The rafia bag in light orange, embroidered with rafia stitches and with a white leather handle, was the central piece of La Riviera collection of designers Jacquemus for spring/summer 2019 at the Paris Fashion Week.
The designer of the famous Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags to arrive in stores next summer – because the designer made such a strong impression, the demand for too big accessories would be hard to ignore.”
John Edward: Knowledge of Languages Is Essential for Global Citizens
Scottish independent schools enjoy the fame of academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding results on exams further enhanced by individual and collective successes in sports, arts, music and other community endeavors.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the highest level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools want to prepare their students for further and higher education, the chosen career path and the place they have as global citizens.
As a sector of education that can shape and implement a tailored school program, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable elective subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “When you talk to a person in a language that he understands, the conversation gets in his memory.
But if you speak to a man in his mother tongue, the words are imprinted in his heart.”
This is a good reminder that we should not rely solely on English when we want to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year’s results of recent exams show that languages are at the top of the ranking with the highest rates of achievement in independent schools.
68% of students who have learned a foreign language have achieved an excellent grade.
Data collected from 74 Scottish Members’ Schools’ Council for Independent Schools (SCIS) showed that 72 percent of the pupils scored excellent in Mandarin, while 72 percent of the pupils scored excellent in German, 69 percent in French and 63 percent in French.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are treated as an optional subject in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere as subjects in the fields of natural science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Training Commission found that 17 per cent of the reasons employers struggle to fill vacancies are attributable to a lack of language proficiency.
Therefore, knowledge of languages is becoming increasingly necessary in preparing young people for their future career path.
With future employment opportunities requiring knowledge of languages, these skills are essential in the global world.
If someone learns another language, whatever the career path they choose, with such lifelong knowledge, they will have a great advantage in the future.
A multilingual person who can communicate directly with people from foreign countries has an automatic advantage over the competition.
A 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK found that 75 percent of people didn’t speak a foreign language well enough to be able to speak, with French being the only language spoken by a dubious percentage of 15 respondents.
Therefore, investing in language learning is important for today’s children.
With the knowledge of several languages, especially those from developing countries, children have a better chance of finding a suitable job.
In Scotland, schools differ in the languages they are taught.
Many schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are expected to be most important to the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests, it will always be possible to choose a number of languages in independent schools taught by experts in this field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare and equip children with the knowledge they need to succeed, regardless of what the future brings.
In the global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages remain of extreme importance for the future of the country, so this must also be expressed in education.
In fact, modern languages should be treated as ‘international communication skills’.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron to debut in the Lakers suit in San Diego on Sunday
For fans who are looking forward to LeBron James’s first performance for the Los Angeles Lakers team, the wait will soon be over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening game of Sunday's pre-season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
He doesn’t know how many minutes he will play.
"More than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers team reporter Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James is likely to play for a few minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers games ahead of the season.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need a pre-season match,” he said.
Trump's convention in West Virginia on YouTube
President Donald Trump is launching a series of conventions in West Virginia’s Wheeling today.
This is the first of Trump’s five scheduled conventions next week, including in favoured states, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
As his nominee for a vacancy in the Supreme Court has not yet been confirmed, Trump wants to gain support for upcoming interim elections as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time will Trump’s convention in West Virginia be, and where can you watch it online?
The Trump convention in Wheeling, West Virginia will be held on Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m.
You can watch Trump’s convention in West Virginia live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to talk about the hearings of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh this week, who have become tense over allegations of sexual misconduct, which is expected to postpone the confirmation in the Senate by one week that the FBI will conduct an investigation.
But the primary goal of this series of conventions is to help Republicans awaiting important elections in November to get a new start.
That’s why President Trump’s campaign aimed at “encouraging volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and increase the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives.”
“Congress oversight is so important to his program that during the tough campaign season, the president will travel to as many countries as possible,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Today’s convention at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could also be attended by supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, according to West Virginia MetroNews, which would attract Pittsburgh media interest.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in the last month, in which he received more than 40 percent points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in public investigations.
“It’s a bad sign for Morrisey that the president has to come and ‘warn’ him in public research,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder's Cup 2018: The U.S. team still wants to win and keeps hope ahead of Sunday's individual duels
After three unilateral games, it may have been the Saturday afternoon duel of two pairs (foursmo) that needed this year’s Ryder Cup.
Falling nail is a completely invented sports concept, but players really believe in it, especially in such competitions.
So, where did the nail be transferred now?
“They had six points ahead and now they have four, so it’s probably a new start for us,” said Jordan Spieth at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has an advantage because it leads by four points, and twelve more can win.
But the Americans, according to Spieth, feel that they have the wind in the yard, in addition to being stimulated by the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each won three out of four points.
Spieth was destined from the start to the greenhouse and gives a good example.
The screams of luck continued to become louder and led to a decisive blow when Thomas and I scored two points in the fourth game.
The strike, which brought them a victory on hole 15, was accompanied by a similar scream, one that lets you know that he believes the American team still has opportunities.
“You just have to find your inner strength and focus on your game,” Spieth said.
That’s all that’s left for the players.
Eighteen holes to the slave.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas have in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of Ryder's Cup.
An unusual but charming pair of Europe has won four out of four points and are indisputable.
The two Molliwoods were the only ones who did not hit the buggy on Saturday afternoon, and they avoided the buggy on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and at the last nine holes on Friday morning.
Such a game and the way in which the energy is apparently flowing between them and the noisy audience is confirmed by the fact that they are the players that will have to be defeated on Sunday, and no other player would be able to better seal the possible victories of Europe on a golf course like the Fleetwood or the National Iglard.
If possible, both at the same time in different holes.
But talking about European glory would be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergio Garcio, the morning hero in a four-ball game that was paired with Alex Noren.
Due to the bug and two double bugs in the first nine holes, the Spaniards and Sweden fell into a crisis from which they could not find a way out.
On Saturday, the players won’t be able to help.
The game with four balls and duels of two pairs is an exception interesting to closely monitor due to the communication between pairs, the tips they give themselves, the tips they do not give themselves, and the way in which the strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better than the team so far and has a lot of advantage over the last day, but the two-double matches have shown that the U.S. team also has a desire to win, which some, especially on the American side, have doubted.
Europe leads 10:6 ahead of Ryder's final day
Europe is on the last day of Ryder's Cup with a good lead after Saturday's four-ball and two-double matches lead by 10:6 against the United States.
The excellent pair, consisting of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, gave their best and with two victories over Tiger Woods and four points at Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who tries to win the trophy she lost two years ago in Hazelton, had in the morning games with four balls over the American team that failed, and said in a row with 3:1.
The U.S. team fought better in the two-double matches, where they won two games, but could not compensate for the rest.
Jim Fury's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 individual matches if they want to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European innovator to win four consecutive points, while Molinari and Molliwood (the pair were named “Molliwood”) were the second pair to win four points in their first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After winning over Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they proved again, and even more convincingly defeated spent Woods and American novelist Bryson Dechambeau by 5 and 4.
Woods, who pulled through two games on Saturday, showed his brilliance for moments, but lost 19 of 29 games in four-ball matches and two-double matches, seven of them consecutively.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning game with four balls, returned for a duel of two pairs and in pairs with Henrik Stenson with 2 and 1 defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koeopko, who were ranked first and third on the world scale.
But on a pleasant, windy day in the southwestern part of Paris, not everything went according to the plans of the team of Europe.
The three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a new benchmark for the Americans on Saturday with two points.
With 2 and 1 they decisively won against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a four-ball game and later returned and defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4 and 3 in the two-double matches, losing the first two holes.
Only once in the history of Ryder's Cup, the team returned after a four-point rebound before the individual matches, although Furyk's team only needs an equation to keep the trophy.
But after two days in another place, a Sunday counterattack may seem too much for her.
North Korea: “Without trust, we will not disarm unilaterally”
The North Korean foreign minister on Saturday told the United Nations that the continued implementation of the sanctions is causing growing distrust in the United States and that under such conditions, North Korea will certainly not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Jong Ho said at the annual General Assembly of this world body that North Korea had taken a number of "significant measures in goodwill" last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, undermining the city's nuclear tests and nuclear tests.
“But we don’t see the appropriate response from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, we will not be confident in national security, and under such conditions we will not be unilaterally the first to disarm ourselves.”
While Ri reiterated North Korea’s well-known complaints about Washington’s resistance to a gradual nuclear disarmament approach, in which North Korea would be rewarded for the adoption of gradual measures, his statement was significant because it did not overlook this act as an immediate rejection.
Mr Ri linked to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump from the first summit between the current U.S. president and the North Korean leader, held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to try to ensure "nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula."
North Korea wants an official end to the Korean War, which took place between 1950 and 1953, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington has also not declined to call for the release of the harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
“The U.S. insists that we must first disarmament nuclear, and increase pressure with sanctions to force us to achieve our goals, and even oppose the declaration of the end of the war,” he said.
“When he thinks that sanctions could put us on our knees, it’s an unrealistic hope for people who don’t know us at all.
The problem, however, is that the continued enforcement of the sanctions deepens our distrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. president presented to the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Mun Jin, which took place in the past five months, adding: “If we were talking about the issue of nuclear disarmament with South Korea and not the United States, we would not be able to do so.”
However, the tone of Riyadh’s speech was quite different from last year’s, when the United Nations General Assembly said the attack on the U.S. mainland with North Korean missiles was unavoidable after Mr. Trump called Kim a “missile man on a self-propelled mission.”
This year, Trump, who threatened last year to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised Kim and his bravery at the United Nations Assembly in adopting disarmament measures, but said he was still waiting for a lot of work and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea breaks down.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no planned timeframe for this, stating: “It can take two years, three years, or five months – it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia are of the opinion that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
On Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council: “The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must be decisively continued without exception until we recognize the complete, final and verified state of nuclear disarmament.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously adopted additional sanctions against North Korea to prevent the financing of North Korean nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo and Riyadh met on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly and later said they would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit has not ended well.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he said progress had been made, and North Korea had already criticized him in a matter of hours if his demands were to be “gangsters.”
At a meeting with Mun this month, North Korea pledged to undermine its missile test station and nuclear-testing infrastructure if the United States takes “adequate measures”.
Kim is said to have said that “adequate measures” refer to the security assurances Trump promised in Singapore, as well as measures to normalize relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard University attend a course where they learn how to take enough time to rest
The goal of this year’s new course at Harvard University is to teach all undergraduate students how to afford more sleep. With this course, they want to fight against the growing mathematical culture of “cell” learning, in which power is accumulated with caffeine.
A university professor has found that students of the world's best universities often do not know the basics of caring for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Women's Hospital, designed a course that was his first of its kind in the United States.
To carry out such a course, he decided after his lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end of the lecture, the girl approached him and said, “Why do I know this only now that I’m in my last year?”
She said no one had told her yet how important sleep is, and the professor told The Daily Telegraph that it surprised him.
The course, which takes place for the first time this year, talks about the key importance of good sleep habits for study and sports success as well as for improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the University’s executive director of health services, says that they decided to take such a course when they found that students had a significant lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive assignments.
In one section, the picture is the door of a student’s home, where students can click coffee cups, curtains, sports cups and books to get information about the influence of caffeine and light, the impact of lack of sleep on sports success, and the importance of a sleep routine.
In the second section, however, participants learn that long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart failure, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the student settlement with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that the behavior of the students will not change immediately.
But we think they have the right to be aware of these facts, just as they have the right to know how smoking cigarettes affect their health,” added Professor Czeisler.
The professor says that the culture of pride is still present with “living whole-night learning.” He also adds that modern technology and increasing pressure on students, resulting in a lack of sleep, are a growing problem.
Professor Czeisler says that a sufficient amount of quality sleep should be a “secret weapon” of students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety. This way they can also avoid gaining weight – the brain due to lack of sleep.they are lazy in a way if they are not hungry for hunger.
19-year-old Californian student of chemistry and physical biology Raymond So helped Professor Czeisler shape the course. Last year, during his first year at Harvard, he attended a lecture by one of the professors.
He says the lecture opened his eyes and encouraged him to take a course throughout the student settlement.
Hopefully, in the next phase of the postgraduate program, students will be able to request to complete a similar study program before enrolling in a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set up a sleep alarm as well as a wake-up call. He also wants to warn them of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic displays and LED lighting, as they can cause imbalance of circadian rhythm, due to this
Livingston: Rangers <0x3D> 1 : 0 Menga hit the Gerrard team
The Rangers again defeated guests: Dolly Menga in Livingston's declared team Steven Gerrard condemned to defeat by 1-0.
The Ibrox team scored their first guest victory after the February victory at St. Johnstone Stadium with 4:1, but Gary Holt's team defeated her second in 18 matches since he was headed by Gerrard, leaving his team for the leading team of the Scottish League behind.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the selected Rangers did not give the impression that he wanted to match.
With this, the Rangers fell to a frequent place and Livingston advanced to third place, but with a difference of goals the Hibernian team was behind.
Calum Spence, a side judge, suffered a head injury when an object flew in from the fan base of the visiting team after reporting.
Gerrard in the crew, who easily defeated Ayr and placed in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup, made eight shifts.
On the other hand, Holt held on to the verified Livingston eleven, who had taken the Hearts team a week earlier, and was undoubtedly impressed by how his fleeing team effectively neutralized all of the guests' attempts.
The Rangers had a higher possession of the ball, but Livingston made better use of it.
The first opportunity came just two minutes after Menga found Scott Pittman with the first short-circuit, then went on to goal Allan McGregor, but the link was inaccurate in the performance and missed the opportunity.
A long free shot by Keaghan Jacobs was then reached by Captain Craig Halkett, but the ball was later defeated by his defensive assistant Alan Lithgow.
In the last third, the Rangers took control, but the game pointed to hope rather than the actual desire to win.
Alfredo Morelos was pretty sure that after a race with Steven Lawles after 15 minutes of the game, a penalty shoot-out would have to be awarded, but Judge Steven Thomson put the Colombian in a pit.
In the first half, the Rangers managed to score only two shots on the goal, but not a shot with the head that Lassana Coulibaly had sent against the goal, nor a ball shot by Oviedo Eyari, which was no danger to goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
Livingston’s opening goal in the 34th minute may have surprised everyone, but he was already fully deserved for his persistence.
Rangers failed to unveil another Jacobs sequel with a long dish.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher put the ball to Scott Robinson, who routinely prepared Mengi's dish for an easy finish of the attack.
Gerrard took action and, during Coulibaly's break, replaced Ryan Kent, who immediately proved himself to be a part of Morelos, but Kelly effectively escaped from his line and blocked the attack.
Still, Livingstone continued in his style and forced the guests into his game, with Lithgow and Halkett taking care of more pitches before the goal.
Holt's team could have increased the lead by the end of the match, but McGregor effectively neutralized Jacobs, and then Lithgow was inaccurate from the angle.
At the Rangers, Glenn Middleton was given a penalty shot after contact with Jacobs at the end of the game, but Judge Thomson did not recognize him.
Almanah: The Inventor of Geiger's Counter
We present a page from the Almanach of our Sunday editions: on September 30, 1882, that is, on today’s day more than 136 years ago, Johannes Wilhelm „Hans“ Geiger, who later became a world-famous physicist, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, this invention was the basis for the development of a device called the Geiger Counter.
She has become a permanent permanent in the scientific world, and has also gained her place in pop culture, for example in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans play cowboy scientists:
Man: “What the hell is that?”
Rogers: “This is Geiger’s counter. It is used to search for radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on your headphones, you can hear the effect that radioactivity has on the atoms in the materials.”
Evans: “Madonna, now they’re really advertising!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
The invention with his name lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine Can Help Immune System Recognize Attacking Cells
A new cancer vaccine can help the immune system to recognize and destroy attacking cells.
The vaccine in therapy teaches the immune system to recognize attacking cells
This method involves the acquisition of patients' immune cells, which are then modified in the laboratory.
After that they can "see" the protein that is typical for many forms of cancer, then they are returned to the patient
The results of the test vaccine are highly encouraging in patients with very different cancers.
In one of the women who received the vaccine that the immune system learns to recognize attacking cells, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
This method involves acquiring the patient’s immune cells, which they modify in the laboratory, so that they can “see” the HER2 protein, which is characteristic of many cancers, and then re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Institute for Cancer Research, Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our findings suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "promotes the growth of several different types of cancers", including breast, ovaries, lungs and colon cancers.
A similar approach to acquiring immune cells from patients who are “learning” to target cancer cells also worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West, after performing at SNL, scored a protrump point with the inscription MAGA on the drops.
The audience was not impressed.
Kanye West was spotted in a Saturday Night Live studio after a strange point during which he expressed support for U.S. President Donald Trump, and also said he would be pulling for the 2020 presidential chair.
At the end of the show with a third song of his performance, called "Ghost Town", during which he wore a cap entitled "Make America Great Again", West began attacking Democrats and again expressed his support for Trump.
“I often talk to a white person and he says, ‘How can you like Trump because he’s a racist?’”
“Well, if I were worried about racism, I should have moved out of America a long time ago,” he said.
This time the SNL broadcast began with a parody with Matt Damon, in which a Hollywood actor plunged himself from the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh before the Justice Commission in the Senate, which Christine Blasey Ford accused of sexual assault.
West's monologue was not played, but was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not known if Rock was going to go crazy with it from West.
West also complained to the public, among other things, that he had some problems in the back of his head because of his writing.
“They’ve got me behind the scenes.
They told me, ‘Don’t go out of your way.’
I'm being bullied!
"They say I'm lost," the Washington Examiner said.
West continued, “Do you want to see the lost scene?” and added, “Superman’s hug has to be found, because it means that no one can command me.
Try it with love.”
His comments prepared the audience to whisper at least twice, and the SNL team members were in apparent turmoil, and someone told Vanity: “There was a deadly silence in the studio.”
West was last minute invited to a goat exchange for Ariano Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West has already caused a lot of surprise with the video for the song "I Love It", where he wore a Perrier mineral water bottle costume.
Westa was supported by Candace Turner, leader of the TPUSA Conservative Group, who tweeted: “One of the bravest souls: THANK YOU FOR GOING AWAY.”
Interview host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is simply “what it is, and that’s all right.
However, I will NOT reward anyone (by buying his music, by dressing or by supporting his “art”) who in my opinion welcomes and spreads an ideology that is harmful to our community.
He's free.
“We too,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper tweeted that he had changed his name and will be "better, formally known as Kanye West. Now I'm YE."
He was not the first musician to change his name, and did it before Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His fellow resident Snoop Dogg once called himself Snoop Lion, but we can’t forget another musical legend: Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then he was an Artist, once known as Prince.
Man Accused of Attempting to Murder in Belfast Restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was kidnapped at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
Police say the incident took place in Ballyhackamor.
The defendants are expected to appear in court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the public prosecutor.
Star Game of Thrones Kit Harington sharply staged against toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is renowned for his blasting of the sword in the role of Jonah Snow in HBO's exciting medieval colorful fantasy series Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor, who strongly condemned the stereotype of a mathematical hero, says that due to the appearance of such roles on screens, young boys often feel that they can only earn respect with durability.
Kit told The Sunday Times Culture that something went wrong in his opinion, and wondered how to cope with the problem of toxic masculinity during the <0x23>JazTudi movement.
The actor, who recently married 31-year-old Rose Leslie, has admitted that he has strong beliefs about the subject.
“I’m personally seriously wondering where we’ve made the mistake when it comes to masculinity,” he said.
“What did we teach men when we were growing up about the problems we are now facing?”
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity due to the depiction of very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is born, and what is learned?
What do we learn on television and on the streets that young boys feel that they have to choose just that particular salary of masculinity?
I think one of the important questions of our time is, how can we change this?
“Something was wrong with young people.”
In the interview, he also said that after the end of the series next summer, he would not be involved in any preface filming or the continuation of the Game of Thrones because he had “concluded with battleships and horses.”
In November, Kit will play the lead role of the new show True West Sam Shepard, which is the story of the film producer and his brother the thief.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that happened due to the Game of Thrones was that he met his wife Rose on filming.
“Because of this series, I met my wife, so she somehow gave me my future family and life from here on out,” he said.
In the Emmy-winning fantasy series, Rose played Ygritte, Kit's love-selected character Jonah Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China Reports 14 Percent Increase in New Cases
China has reported a 14 percent increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say there are more than 820,000 people affected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the disease has been transmitted with sexual intercourse, which represents a change compared to the past.
Usually, the HIV virus has spread rapidly in some parts of China due to the transfusion of infected blood.
However, according to Chinese health officials at a conference in Junan province, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has declined to almost zero.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China is increasing by 100,000 each year.
The transmission of HIV with sexual intercourse is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still very present.
Because conservative values are still in place in the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry a woman.
The disease is often transmitted due to inadequate protection during sexual intercourse in such relationships.
Since 2003, as part of efforts to resolve the problem, the Chinese government has promised general access to HIV medicines.
Maxine Waters denies that staff have released information about Republican senators, condemns "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theory"
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff posted information about three U.S. Republican senators on their Wikipedia website.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the allegations came from individuals and websites of the far right.
"Lies, lies and even more unacceptable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information reportedly included the home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrina Hatcha from Utah.
The data appeared on the internet on Thursday, published by an unknown person from Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on charges of sexual harassment of Supreme Judge Brett Kanaugh.
The information leaked came after the three senators concluded a hearing with Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState state that through an IP address it is possible to identify the source of the post, which is supposed to be linked to Senator Waters’ office, and conclude that the information was posted by one of the staff, Hill reports.
“These unfounded accusations are completely false and pure lies,” Waters continued.
“My employees whose identity, personal data and security are under threat as a result of these false allegations are in no way responsible for the leakage of this data.
“These unfounded accusations are completely untrue and pure lies.”
Senator Waters' statement was quickly met with criticism on the internet, including by former White House spokesman Aria Fleischer.
“From this denial of the branch of anger,” Fleischer wrote.
“This may not be a real test for Congress.
When you accuse someone of something he hasn't done, you can't show anger.
You can't resist.
And we must not doubt the motive of the one who accused him.
You have to stay calm.”
Fleischer compared Waters' response to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too apparently angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who runs for Watersov in the midterm elections, tweeted.
“If that’s true, it’s serious,” he tweeted.
Waters said in a statement that her cabinet had notified “the relevant institutions and prosecution authorities regarding these false accusations.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed, and that they will be held accountable for all acts that are harmful and dangerous to every member of my staff and to all of them.”
Johnny English back in action - Rowan Atkinson as a secret agent
Searching for hints on Brexit in any new British film has already become traditional, and it also applies to the revival of Johnny English action comedy, which first appeared on canvas in 2003 titled Johnny English and a sequel in 2011 titled Johnny English 2.
Will a fun satire about how unsuccessful we are be a new export opportunity for us?
Incompetent Johnny English with eyebrows and unusual grimaces gets permission to re-mix strings; his name already indicates that this is a comic character created for a cinematic audience in non-English speaking areas.
It's an unsettling secret agent who, despite his bizarre moves, contains a part of Clouseau, Mr. Bean's cane, and the smallness of the one who contributed the last note to Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
It is also based on the traveler and the international mystery that Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten TV ad for Barclaycard, leaving behind a real chaos.
In the newest film, one or two pleasant moments are presented.
I liked it when Johnny English was approaching in a helicopter, he was wearing a medieval armor, and the rotor leaves were briefly touched by his helmet.
Atkinson’s gift for comedy is clearly portrayed, but humor seems somewhat mild and excessively unnecessary, especially because “real” films like 007 or Mission are impossible now without bad news offering comic elements.
It seems that humor is aimed at children and not so much at adult audiences, which is why for me the dismissal of Johnny English's occasions are not as innovative and directed as Atkinson's nemi sketches as Mr. Bean.
The constant issue is now obvious that the UK is in serious trouble.
The hacker infiltrated the online network of British top-secret agents and revealed the identities of all British agents, causing great trouble to the competent agent, who is portrayed by Kevin Eldon in a surprisingly small role.
This is the breakpoint for the prime minister, a pompous figure who has already suffered a break due to political unpopularity: Emma Thompson has struggled with the role of presumed Teresa May, but there is nothing in the script that could help.
The Intelligence Service informs her that all active spies are being disclosed, so she must decide on one of the retired spies.
And that means Johnny English, now a teacher at a prestigious school, who informally teaches how to act undercover: this is where the screenwriters are hit, as English performs some sort of spy “rock academy.”
Englishmen are taken to Whitehall to an emergency meeting where he meets a longtime collaborator, Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a stereotypical sports enthusiast, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little lost.
So Batman and Robin are ready to create even more trouble in the name of her Majesty's Secret Service, while encountering the fatal Ophelio Bullet, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously under the influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: this is the evil Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey: dressed in a firefighter in a French restaurant, creates chaos when it overheats on the roof of the Volt yacht, and when English tries to use glasses for the apparent reality to get acquainted with the interior of the cabin of Volt's home, he is in a chaos.
Although the last part contains all the necessary ingredients, despite sympathy and energetic resembles a children’s film.
Very average.
Like other Johnny English films, I can’t help myself here, and I think: Is the British film Atkinson capable of giving a role that actually justifies his talent?
Laborers deny that they plan a four-day working week for Britons, receiving a pay for a five-day working week.
Labor party Jeremy Corbyn is thinking of a radical plan where the British would work four days a week and receive a five-day paycheck.
The client of the business leaders wants the savings created by companies as a result of the artificial intelligence revolution to be passed on to the workers and provide them with an additional day off.
That way, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend with equally high wages.
Sources say the idea is in line with the party’s economic plan and the plan to put the state on the side of the workers.
Trade unions support the transition to a four-day working week, as this is a way for workers to benefit from the benefits of a changing economy.
A Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be published before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day worker is a goal that we will strive to achieve with a customer’s approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of the employee and the customer’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the four-week working week in its campaign in the 2017 general election was supported by the Green Party.
This is not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “The four-week working week is not a party’s policy and the party is not thinking about it.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labor Conference last week to present his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to extract power from “indifferent directors” and “winners” in utilities.
The Chancellor’s shadow plans also mean that current stakeholders in water companies may not be able to regain the full share, as the Labour Party could have been able to initiate “disbursements” on the basis of alleged offences.
He also confirmed plans for the inclusion of workers on the boards of directors and the introduction of the Own Inclusion Funds, thereby transferring 10 percent of the share in private companies to employees who would receive annual dividends up to GBP 500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy were discussing whether their views could be altered by the FBI’s investigation into Kavanaugh.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week and raises the question of whether the findings of any Republican senator's office could convince the judge to withdraw his support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, a 60-minute reporter from Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked if the FBI could find out anything that would change its mind.
Kennedy seemed more open to this than a colleague from South Carolina.
“I think, of course,” said Kennedy.
“Before the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
When I called him, when the charge came up, I asked him, ‘Did you do that?’”
He was decisive, unmistakable, unambiguous.”
Graham's voice seems to be stuck in a stone.
“I created my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and I would need an extremely convincing reason to change it,” he said.
“I don’t know what happened to Dr. Ford, but I know the following: Brett definitely denied it,” added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of those whom she has named could confirm this.
The case is 36 years old.
I don’t see any new changes.”
What is the Global Citizens Festival and has it contributed to poverty reduction in any way?
This Saturday, New York will host the Festival of Global Citizens, an annual musical event attended by a truly extraordinary kind of stars and with the same extraordinary mission: eradicating poverty in the world.
The festival, which will take place for the seventh time, will be attended by dozens of people. They will occupy the Great Trail of Central Park not only to enjoy the performances of musicians like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to awaken the interest for the real purpose of the event.
The Global Citizens Festival, which began in 2012, is the expansion of the Global Citizens Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free event ticket (unless you’re willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concert participants had to perform a variety of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, a letter to a world leader, a phone call, or any other meaningful way to increase their interest.
How successful is the Global Citizen movement, which has 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the right way to convince them to call for action, or is this just another example of so-called “clictivism” – creating the belief that people actually make a significant impact on situations by signing an online petition or mediating it?
According to the Global Citizen Movement, more than 19 million “acts” of its supporters have been recorded since 2011 in efforts for a variety of different targets.
He says these actions have helped world leaders make more than <0x24>37 billion in commitments and policies, which are expected to impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group stated that the result of its actions would be 390 commitments and messages that have already been paid or collected at least <0x24>10 billion.
The group estimates that the funds raised so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and decision-makers committed to “help children realise their full potential” who pledged Rwandans <0x24>35 million in aid to help eliminate malnutrition after receiving more than 4 global nations.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and global citizens like you, we can spread the social guilt of malnutrition into historical archives,” Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of the Power Diet Partnership, told the crowd at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said the government, following more than 5,000 actions called on the United Kingdom to improve the diet of mothers and children, to co-finance the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million women and children through nutrition measures.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on the website, “Why do you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?”,
The Global Citizen Movement responded: “This will be a long and hard road – sometimes we will fall and we will fall.
But just like the big civil rights movement and the fight against apartheid in front of us, we will succeed as we are stronger together.
Some performers who will perform at this year's New York event include Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe. The event will be led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use U.S. Navy to “block” Russian energy exports
U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke is said to have said that Washington could use the navy “if necessary” to prevent Russian energy marketing, among other things in the Middle East.
Zinke said Russian mediation in Syria (it should be noted that at the invitation of the legitimate government) is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
“I think the reason for their presence in the Middle East is the desire to market energy, as it is marketed in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe,” he said.
However, according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
“The United States can do this. The navy ensures that our sea routes are open and blocks them if necessary, thereby preventing Russian energy sources from entering the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event hosted by the Energy Consumers Union, a non-profit group that celebrates as “the voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s approach to Russia and Iran, warning that it is actually the same.
“As for Iran and Russia, the economic option is more or less to influence and replace fuels,” he said, denoting Russia as “a pressure that knows a trick,” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements were made at a time when the Trump administration is striving to increase exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, where it is said to undermine Russia, which is a significantly cheaper choice for European consumers.
For this purpose, Trump government officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to give up the “inappropriate” North Stream 2 pipeline project that would make it a “talent” of Moscow after Trump’s Berlin.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the <0x24>11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double its existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusive economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington strongly opposes the project only for economic reasons and that it is unfair competition.
“In my view, we have the same view that energy should not be a tool for exercising pressure and that consumers should have the right to choose suppliers,” Russia’s energy minister, Alexander Novak, said after a September meeting with US energy minister Rick Perry in Moscow.
Germany rejected the U.S. position and reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, the German Industry Association (BDI), has called on the United States not to interfere in the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“Interferring a third country into our energy supply is a big problem for me,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Association (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will “study” her candidacy for the 2020 U.S. presidential election, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would “examine” her candidacy for president after the midterm elections.
In a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider the nomination.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our corrupt government, which demands a female leader,” she told The Hill.
“After November 6th, I will carefully examine my candidacy for president.”
During a meeting in the city hall, Warren was mocking President Donald Trump as “it was supposed to lead this country in the wrong direction.”
“What Donald Trump is doing to our democracy is terribly worrying me,” she said.
Warren has repeatedly openly criticized Trump and the nominee for president of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet posted on Friday, Warren said: “Of course, we need an FBI investigation before the election.”
However, a poll published Thursday showed that most of her own voters believe Warren should not run for president in 2020.
According to a poll by the University of Suffolk’s Political Research Center/Boston Globe magazine, the senator should not run for president, eighty-five percent of the “probable” voters from Massachusetts.
Twenty-three percent of the candidates would support it.
The poll showed that former Governor Deval Patrick has a greater support for the nomination, with 38 percent of respondents supporting it and 48 percent opposing it.
The other high-ranking Democrats to be considered for the 2020 election are former vice-president Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden, according to the Associated Press, said he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin has mentioned post-traumatic stress disorder in support of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enrolling in the military.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“What my own son ends up experiencing after his return connects me to other families who are dealing with the post-traumatic stress disorder and a certain degree of woundedness that our soldiers are returning with,” he told the audience at a rally in support of Donald Trump Tulsi.
Palina called her son's arrest a "sleep in the salon" and said that her son and other military veterans were returning slightly altered, reluctant, wondering where there was respect for what fellow soldiers and aircraft and all other members of the military gave to the state."
Track Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence by assaulting a woman, obstruction of domestic violence and possession of weapons in a guilty state, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasila police station.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the rejection of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal rejection of a new U.S. policy that denies the right to asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
NBC News reported on Friday that representatives from 18 countries and districts were filling the courtroom to support the legal exercise of the policy.
The full name of the prosecutor in Grace’s lawsuit against Sessions, filed by the U.S. Civil Liberties Union against federal politics, has not been published.
She said she was abused by her partner and “his violent sons, members of the gang,” but on July 20, the U.S. authorities rejected her request for asylum.
She was taken to Texas.
The state prosecutors of the states that support Grace are Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, from which numerous asylum applications to the United States are coming, described as countries that are constantly facing problems with tolls and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy in 2014 repealed the decision of the Immigrant Invitation Committee to allow unregistered immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The District Attorney General of Columbia, General Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "is contrary to decades of state, federal and international law."
“Federal law requires that all asylum claims be assessed on the basis of the individual facts and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates this principle,” the court’s application states.
Prosecutors further stated in the request that a policy that denies immigrants the right to enter is detrimental to the U.S. economy, as they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary workforce.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges to cease granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear associated with race, religion, nationality or membership in individual social groups or political opinion,” Sessions said in a statement.
Asylum has never been designed to eliminate all the problems, even the serious problems that people face every day around the world.
The number of victims in Palu has doubled, but desperate rescue attempts are underway to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
“The feeling is very tense,” said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma’s mother, comforting her hot boyfriend in an evacuation center in the scattered city of Palu.
Rescue workers are constantly transporting corpses.
It lacks clean water.”
They seemed to be burglars, returning to the destroyed homes, flipping through the stuffed up and trying to find anything useful.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals destroyed by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake were overloaded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered back and shoulder injuries, rested outside a military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated for heavy post-mortem suns outdoors.
When he recalled a violent earthquake that shook a hotel room on the fifth floor where he was staying with his wife and daughter, his eyes filled with tears.
“There was no time to get rid of it.
I think I was pushed against the ruins of the walls,” Harris told the Associated Press, adding that he was in town with his family for the wedding.
“I heard a woman calling for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of 'Propaganda Ads'
A week after the publication of a four-page official Chinese newspaper ad in the U.S. newspaper, which praised the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China in Beijing accused the U.S. press of abusing propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Sunday mentioned a paid addition to the China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the best-selling newspaper in Iowa, after China accused China of interfering in the U.S. congressional election on November 6, which China denies.
Reuters reported that U.S. federal officials have described Trump’s accusation of attempting to interfere in U.S. federal elections as a new phase in Washington’s increasingly intense effort to pressure China.
Although it is common for foreign governments to publish ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an increasingly intense trade war, in which they are swapping strikes by imposing tariffs on imported products.
China's repatriation tariffs at the start of the trade war are expected to affect exporters in states like Iowa that support Trump's Republican party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former long-time governor of China, Iowe, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had affected U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a column in the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register, “now this harassment doubles by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“In spreading propaganda, the Chinese government has taken advantage of the precious American tradition of free speech and the free press to publish a paid ad in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the other hand, you will see few other opinions on the Beijing newspaper stand and no real reflection of the diversity of opinions Chinese citizens have on the worrying Chinese economic path, as the Communist Party of China is strictly controlled by the Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of the most important Chinese newspapers rejected an offer to publish” his article, although he did not specify which one.
Republicans Lose Elections Before Interim Elections with Kavanaugh Poll, Analysts Warn
Analysts point out that the support of many of the most important Republicans who support and defend candidates for Brett Kavanaugh's supreme court, despite several sexual assault allegations, will be known for the upcoming interim elections with a loss of votes.
The feelings here are extremely high, and most Republicans have already said they want to continue voting.
This cannot be reversed,” said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell University in Syracuse for an article published Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's pressure to investigate the FBI at the last minute would be enough to calm the angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday, nor will they forget tomorrow, nor will they forget November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the MoveOn Advanced Group, according to a Washington, D.C. report.
On Friday morning, protesters sang “November is coming!” as they protested in the Senate hall, when Republicans overseeing the Judiciary Committee decided to continue supporting Kavanaugh’s appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
“Democrats’ enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond all borders,” said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst.
“People say they’re strong now, and it’s true.
But it could be even stronger, especially in indeterminate suburbs and younger voters aged 18 to 29, who otherwise dislike the president, but do not vote often.
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which she detailed her allegations of sexual assault of a supreme court candidate, analysts said further Republican support could have negative consequences.
“It has become a big mess for the GOP,” according to NBC News earlier this week, said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Council.
“It’s not just a council vote or a final vote or Kavanaugh’s pledge; it’s also a way Republicans deal with it by Republicans and how they treated Ford,” said Guy Cecil, director of the U.S. Priorities Group, who supports Democrats in the election.
However, Americans seem somewhat divided between this, or more reliant on the testimony of Ford or Kavanaugh, with a little more support for the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely believe in Ford’s testimony, and 35 percent said they believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent of them said they thought Kavanaugh was probably or certainly was lying while testifying, and only 30 percent said that about Ford.
According to Flake, the FBA is currently investigating allegations made by Ford and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary that Kavanaugh had attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her sex while they were at a party during their studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
Inventor of the World Wide Web Plans to Launch New Internet to Fight Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the global web, is launching a startup that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners’ open-source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokes that Inrupt’s intention was “to dominate the world.”
“We have decided to do this now,” he said of the new company.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The application uses the Solid platform technology, which allows the user to create a "private data storage" or POD
This may include contact information, task lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser and at the same time.
The peculiarity of the personal data storage facility is that the user can fully determine who can access what information.
The company calls this “personal authorization with data”.
CEO John Bruce says the company’s idea is to combine the resources, processes and appropriate skills that will enable everyone to access the Solid platform.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a few hired developers to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
By this week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and the group “do not talk to Facebook and Google about whether they could introduce a complete change that could cancel all of their business models overnight.”
“We don’t ask them for permission.”
In a press release on the Medium portal, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s goal is to “provide commercial energy and ecosystems to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on the Solid platform.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet with the founding of the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on internet neutrality.
Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely optimistic about the next Internet era,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The Victory Cross Bearer of the First World War
In their home town for 100 years, they have celebrated the awarding of the Victorian Cross to the sole priest of the English church he gained as a warrior in World War I.
Honorable Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann earned recognition on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But four days later he was shot by a sniper, so he never learned that he was awarded the highest British military honour.
On Saturday, at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, two Colonel's grandchildren discovered a memorial stone.
One of the lawyers, Michael Vann, said it was "extremely symbolic" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the grandfather's act with which he earned the award.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the St. Quintin Canal "through a very dense fog and under the powerful fire of a battlefield and machinery."
He later plotted against the shooting line and with “best heroism” led the line forward, then attacked the machine and hit three crew members.
Lieutenant Colonel Vanna was shot by a German gunman on October 4, 2018, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his father’s actions were “something I know and could never achieve, so he taught me humility.”
With his brother, Dr. James Vann, they also laid a veil on the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt “very honored to be able to participate in this parade,” and that “the courage of a true hero is reflected in the support that many people will express.”
Fans of mixed martial arts spent the night watching Bellator 206, but instead they were interested in Pujse Pepe.
Imagine: You’ve been waking up all night to watch the fully sold out Bellator 206, and then you can’t see the main event.
The San Jose event included 13 duels, including six on the main parquet, and it was broadcast live in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Moussasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet, the audience in the UK found surprisingly that the transmission was replaced by the play of the cartoon Puys Pep.
Many were not very excited, as he remained awake until morning due to the duel.
One of the fans on Twitter described the switch to a children's cartoon as "some kind of a painful joke".
“According to the government regulation, this content is not appropriate at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to a children’s program,” said Dave Schwartz, vice president of Bellator for Marketing and Communications, when asked about the transmission.
"Pepa's pussy.
Bellator chairman Scott Coker said they are trying to adjust the schedule so that future viewers in the UK will also be included.
“When I think about replaying, I think we could fix it,” Coker said.
“But then there is six o’clock in the morning on Sunday, and we will not be able to arrange this until Sunday after our time or Monday after them.
We're all working on it.
Believe me, many messages were exchanged during the switch and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it; we assumed it was just a technical error.
The real reason, however, was the government regulation.
I can promise you that it won't happen again next time.
Instead of six, we’re going to play five matches – as usual. We tried to offer fans more than we expected, and we agreed.
This is a very unpleasant situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “unworthy” about sex
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he felt less valued than anyone because of his sexual orientation – but it gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he realized that “not everyone is the same” as he was when he entered high school.
Speaking on the first broadcast of Desert Island Discs, led by Lauren Laverne for Radio 4, he said he talked about gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that when he became a parent, his desire to win the Olympics diminished.
The regular director of the long-time show, Kirsty Young, was absent due to a months-long illness.
Daley, who appeared as an outcast in Laverne's first show, said he felt "less valuable" than everyone else because "it wasn't socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
“Until today, these feelings of indifference and differentiation are an actual thing that gives me the strength and perseverance to achieve success.”
He wanted to prove that it was “something,” he said, not to disappoint anyone who would finally find out about his direction.
Twice the bronze Olympic contender became an influential advocate for LGBT rights, and this year he appeared twice at the Nations Community Games in Australia to call on countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt happy to be able to speak openly without consequences, and that he wanted to give others “hope.”
The three-time world champion said he was "surprised" by the romance with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married an Oscar winner who is 20 years older than him last year, but said the difference in age never meant any trouble.
“When so young people experience so much,” he said – at the age of 14, he attended the first Olympics and his father died three years later – it’s difficult to find someone of the same age who would experience similar ups and downs.
The couple adopted a child in June, the son of Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says that this changed his "whole view".
“If you asked me last year, it would be all I have to say, ‘I have to get a gold medal,’” he said.
“But, you know, there are bigger things in the world than an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
The son bears the same name as Daley's father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he would have to die, and one of the last things he asked about was whether he already had tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to sit in the first row.
I couldn’t tell him, “This time you won’t be in the first place, Dad.”
“I held him in my hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing and was dead, I had to finally admit that he wasn’t invulnerable,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I knew that was what I had dreamed of all my life – diving at the Olympics in front of the local audience. There was no better feeling,” he said.
This also inspired his first choice of song – the flow of musician Heather Small, who accompanied him in the preparations for the Olympics and at which his skin is still stained.
The Desert Island Discs are broadcast on BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11.15 (BST).
Unprepared Mickelson is Ryder's Saturday Cup seat
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to get back in shape so that it won’t become an unfortunate record.
Mickelson, who will participate in the 12th-record biennial event, has left Captain Furyk to sit on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the event, as was so common for the United States, the five-time winner spent the day partly as a fan and partly improving his game to fix what he was heavier.
Given that even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old does not match the best narrow Le Golf National, where a long ice sheet inevitably penalizes the wrong kicks.
And if only the playground wasn’t scary enough, Mickelson will have to deal with the exact winner of the British Open, Francesco Molinari, who has connected himself to newcomer Tommy Fleetwood in the race to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, who have less than four games at the start of 12 individual games, started well, Mickelson's game could prove decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, otherwise he didn't say much.
"He fully understands the role he played today, he took me on my back and hugged me with his hand and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in you.
He is one of the most famous and has contributed tremendously to the teams in the past and also this week.
I didn't think he was going to play two games.
I imagined more, but it turned out so, and we thought it needed to be done.
He wants to play like everyone else.”
Mickelson will break Nick Falda's record for the highest number of Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
This could mark the end of Ryder's career, which never really matched the height of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven equals, but Furyk said his presence in the team also brings some unacceptable benefits.
“He’s fun, sarcastic, spirited, he likes to work crazy with people and it’s great to have him in a team room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players were having fun with him this week, which was fun to see.”
It’s more than just a game.”
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a big advantage can soon be lost
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant advantage at the start of the last day of Ryder's individual games can easily be thrown into an unpleasant ride.
The young Dane made his debut in 1997 in Valderrama, where the side, whose captain was Seve Ballesteros, had five points ahead of the Americans, and through the goal it got a lead only for the hair, with a score of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"Remember that we had a lot of advantage in Valderrama; we had a lot of advantage in Brooklyn where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won, but hardly," Bjorn said after seeing the Class of 2018 team, who won with 5-3 on Friday and yesterday from the 10th to the 10th.
So the history of me and everyone in the team shows that the game is not over yet.
Play the full game tomorrow.
Go and do everything you need to do.
The game is not over until it's written like this on the board.
We have a goal to win this cup, and we need to stay focused on it.
He’s always said that I’m focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we’re also well aware of who’s on the opposite side – the best players in the world.”
Enthusiasmed at his players’ play on the challenging field, Bjorn added: “I would never have been in a hurry here.
Tomorrow will be a different day.
Tomorrow the game will be at the forefront of the individual, so this will have to be tackled differently.
It’s nice to have a partner when things go well, and when you’re there alone, your golf skills are tested to the end.
This is a message you need to convey to players: Tomorrow you have to get the best out of yourself.
Now leave your partner behind, and he has to get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will encourage his players to play better than their partner, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have scored three out of four points.
Furyk himself was already on both sides of the transformations in the last day, as he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before finishing as a defeat when Europe performed "The Miracle in Medina".
“I remember every word,” he replied when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of the team, told his players on the last day of the game.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we would like to start as fast as we saw in Brookline as we saw in Medina.
When this start gets persistence, it puts a lot of pressure on the midfielder.
We created the right layout and put the boys in a way until we felt we were going to do something magical tomorrow.”
Thomas was given the task to try to lead the battle and fight Rory McIlroy in the best game, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter will be the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
“With this group of boys, I have chosen this order because I think it covers the entire schedule,” Bjorn said of the selection of individuals.
A new German warship has been postponed.
The latest frigate of the German navy should be put into use in 2014 to replace the aging cold-war war war ships, but due to system failures and rapidly increasing costs, it will not be until at least next year, local authorities said.
The delivery of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the new class of the Baden-Wuerttemberg frigate, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, says the official Die Zeit, citing a military representative.
The vessel is expected to join the Navy in 2014, but the ambitious project raises concerns after delivery.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships, ordered in 2007, will replace the aging Fregat class of Bremen.
It is expected that they will have a powerful ball, a variety of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft missiles, and some cover-up technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance intervals – the newest frigates are expected to be able to stay outside the home port for up to two years.
Continuous delays mean that top-of-the-line warships, which are supposed to allow Germany to influence overseas by their power, will become obsolete by the time of the start of use, notes the official Die Ziet.
The accidental F125 frigate appeared on the front pages last year when the German Navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
For the first time, the Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
The reasons for the return are little known, and the German authorities have identified a number of key “software and technical deficiencies” that would render the warship useless if it were sent to a combat mission.
Software shortcomings were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will operate a crew of about 120 sailors – only half of the workforce on the older Bremen class frigates.
It also turned out that the ship was heavily overweight, decreasing its capacity and limiting the Navy's capabilities for its future upgrade.
The 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate ship is said to be twice as heavy as the Germans used in World War II.
In addition to the lack of equipment, the cost of the entire project has also become a problem – including the training of the crew.
It is estimated to have a turnaround of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0x24>3.6 billion) – from the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
Problems with the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany’s naval power is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged that the navy was actually "lacking ships suitable for reference."
The official said that the issue eventually became more serious because old ships were decommissioned and replacement ships were not guaranteed.
He regretted that no Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships could join the navy.
The National Fund Listens to the Secret Life of Netopiri
A new research is being conducted on the Scottish Highlands estate, which seeks to find out how netopires use food for food hunting.
They hope that the results will re-illuminate the behavior of these unique flying insects and help guide future conservation activities.
Scientists from the National Fund for Scotland (NTS) will monitor small nets and small nets, as well as brown catch nets and ambient nets at Inverewe Gardens in the Wester Ross area.
At key sites of ownership will be set up special recorders to monitor the activities of netopiri throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
A professional sound analysis of all footage will confirm the frequency of netopiri calls and what types of things they do.
They will then prepare a habitat map and report to create a detailed picture of their behavior throughout the province.
Rob Dewar, NTS Conservation Advisor, hopes that the results will show which habitat areas are best suited for netophilia and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of grasslands and the conservation of forests for netaphores and other related species.
The number of neoprene populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has declined sharply in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects shelters and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting are also at risk, as well as turbines and some types of chemical treatment of building materials, as well as cat attacks.
Netopiris aren't really blind.
Because of the night hunting habits, they are more helpful with the ears than with the eyes.
They use a sophisticated eco-locating technique to accurately identify errors and obstacles along the way.
The NTS, which is responsible for supplying more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes netophilia very seriously.
It employs ten professionals who regularly conduct research, inspections of shelters and occasional rescues.
The organization has established the first and for now only Scottish reserve on the property of Threave in the Dumfries and Galloway area, specially designed for non-smokers.
David Thompson, the owner of the property, says that the property is the ideal territory for them.
“We have an excellent area for netophilia at Threava,” he said.
“We have old buildings, a lot of ancient trees and a whole quality habitat.
However, there is still much to know about netopiros, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us to better understand what they need to succeed.”
He stressed the importance of checking the presence of neoprene before carrying out maintenance work on the holdings, as the possible accidental destruction of one single neoprene birthplace could cause the death of up to 400 females and puppies, which could result in the decline of the entire local population.
Netopiri are protected, so it is forbidden to kill, harass or disturb them, and it is also forbidden to destroy their birthplaces.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the head of the Scottish Neptune Conservation Fund, encouraged the public to cooperate.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our netopiri, and for many species we simply don’t know how well their populations are holding.”
Ronaldo rejects rape charges, and lawyers are preparing to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations “fake news” and said people wanted to “promote themselves” using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine with the Der Spiegel news, which published the charges.
The attackers of Portugal and Juventus were accused of raping Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that he was supposed to pay her <0x24>375,000 for the incident.
In response to 142 million followers in Instagram Live video hours after the report, 33-year-old Ronaldo described the report as “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said was fake news,” the five-time winner of the Golden Ball told the camera.
“With my name, they want to promote themselves.
That's normal.
By mentioning my name they want to become famous, which is part of the work I do.
I am a happy man and I wish everyone well,” the player added smilingly.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for allegations they called “unacceptable reporting on suspicion of privacy.”
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for “unpaid damages in the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident was reported to take place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
The document filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada is said to have returned to the player's room after a meeting at the Mayor's nightclub with Ronaldo, and that the player was said to have raped her anal there.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the incident and said he was “a 99 percent good man” who disappoints only “one percent.”
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed sexual intercourse, but described it as consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she referred to the police and that photos of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "awful afraid of revenge" and was concerned about "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old says she wants to cancel the deal because she still has a serious trauma as a result of the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was at the time of the alleged attack just before he moved from Real Madrid to Manchester United, and this summer, after a <0x24>100 million deal, he moved to the Italian giant Juventus.
Brexit: the UK 'will forever regret' the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would be “forever regrettable” if it lost its status as the world’s leading carmaker after Brexit, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was “concerning” that Toyota UK told the BBC that Britain’s withdrawal from the EU without a deal would temporarily halt production at a factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of a border delay in the event of a brexit without an agreement could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I think that in the event that the UK leaves the European Union without an agreement at the end of March, production at our factory would stop,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s chief executive officer at the Burnaston plant.
Concerns about how exiting the European Union without an agreement will affect cross-border trade were also expressed by other car manufacturers in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW said that after Brexit, it will close its Mini factory in Oxford in a month.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers call the risks associated with the supply chain, in the case of brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates on a “timely basis,” with parts of suppliers from the UK and the EU arriving every 37 minutes for cars on order.
If the United Kingdom left the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it could lead to disturbances at the borders, which industry representatives say could lead to stagnation and lack of parts.
Toyota will not be able to store parts for more than one day at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, and production would stop.
Clark said Therese May’s plan for future EU relations was “exactly moderated to avoid such border checks.”
“We need to reach an agreement. We want to reach the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but to take this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4.
“The data not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers is that we need to be absolutely able to continue our highly successful supply chain set.”
Toyota could not comment on how long production would be halted, but in the long run it warned that the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at the Burnaston factory for 24 years and is the founder of Unite’s trade union at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, the lost job never returns.”
The government spokesman said: “We need to present an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union.”
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says White House
A significant meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein could have been “intercepted for another week” due to ongoing fighting over candidate for Brett Kavanaugh’s supreme court, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is studying Russian arbitrary interference, ties between Trump’s colleagues and Russia, and the president’s potential obstruction of the judiciary.
The question of whether Trump will fire the Attorney General’s envoy and jeopardize Mueller’s independence has been fuelling Washington’s rumors for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the use of a headset to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of the president's removal under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
Last Monday, he visited the White House, amid reports that he intends to resign.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, which was then held at the United Nations conference in New York, was announced Thursday.
Trump said he would “not forgive” Rosenstein, and the meeting was then postponed to avoid a conflict by hearing the Senate jury hearing Kavanaugh and one of the women accused of inappropriate sexual conduct, Dr. Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate vote.
Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date for him is not yet fixed. It could have happened this week, given everything else that is going on in the Supreme Court, but it could have been postponed for another week.
We’ll see. I always like to make sure you’re informed.”
Sanders hasn't called a White House meeting with journalists since September 10th.
Broadcaster Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the rarity of the meetings was not to be attributed to the resistance to the “setting up” of TV reporters, but said: “She could not deny that they set up.”
She later said that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president holds more press conferences than any president before him,” she said, adding, without mentioning the source: “We looked at the numbers.”
The meetings will still take place,” Sanders said. “But if journalists can address the President of the United States directly with their questions, it is infinitely better than discussing with me.
We are trying to make this possible, and you have seen that we have often done this in the last few weeks and that you will have a conference at which you will be able to speak to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with state-run guests.
Independent press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, when he appeared casually and partly bizarrely in front of armed journalists.
Letter from the EU Minister for Health to NHS Scotland on Brexit-related fears
The Minister of Health wrote to the EU staff working at the Scottish NHS to express the state’s gratitude and the desire to continue the work even after the Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, an SME, sent a letter less than six months before the UK's withdrawal from the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already pledged to pay the costs of application for the status of EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the withdrawal continued, with the decision approaching this autumn.
However, the UK government has also accelerated its preparations for a possible out-of-stage scenario.
I know this must be a time of great concern for all of you.
That is why I would like to stress once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues from all over the European Union and non-member countries bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the healthcare sector and benefit the patients and communities we provide.
You can feel at home in Scotland and we really want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie has an emergency surgery after a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers' line-up supporter, Christion Abercrombie, ended an emergency operation after a head injury in a Saturday's 31:27 defeat against Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ of The Tennessean reported.
The head coach of Tennessee State University told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
“He came to the edge of the playground and he kind of slipped there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff supplied Abercrombie with oxygen on the edge of the playground before putting him on the carriers and taking him out of the playground for further inspection.
An official from Tennessee State University, Chris Harris, of the WSMV channel in Nashville, Tennessee, said Abercrombie was recovering after surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “details about the type/range of the injury are not yet known” and that Tennessee State University is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, who is currently a bruc at the university, plays for Tennessee State University for the first time since graduating from the University of Illinois.
On Saturday, he suffered a total of five strokes before leaving the game, raising his total number of strokes in the season to 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher tax when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher tax when buying a property in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used to help homeless people according to new Tory plans
The move will neutralize Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters
Increased collateral will be charged to those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Treasury expects to collect up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year, and will use it to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher rate of collateral when buying real estate in the UK, and the money raised will be for homeless people, Theresa May said today.
The move should be understood as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide cheaper housing and higher taxation for high-income people.
Increased collagen will be charged to individuals and businesses who do not pay tax in the UK, and additional money will encourage government efforts to eliminate homelessness.
The allowance – which will be charged in addition to the current allowance, including the increased levels introduced two years ago for other homes and property for transfer – could amount to nothing less than three per cent.
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year with the introduction of the measure.
According to estimates, UK non-citizens are expected to buy 13 per cent of London’s newly built properties, resulting in an increase in prices and making it more difficult to buy the first real estate.
Many rich areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “spirit cities” as the number of buyers who spend most of their time outside the country increases.
The new policy was adopted just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in collagen to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
Large construction companies have accused the price rise by hijacking land they are not actually using, Mrs. Mayevo has called for to quit quotas for affordable housing in order to fix Britain's "residential shame."
Mr Corbyn announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including overseeing rents and ending compulsory evictions without errors.
In addition, he wants to give the city councils greater powers to build new homes.
Mrs Mayeva said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my premiership to the renewal of British dreams – that life must be better for every new generation.
This also leads to the renewal of our non-functioning housing market.
The United Kingdom will always be open to people who want to live, work, and create life there.
However, it can’t be as straightforward for people who don’t live in the United Kingdom and for foreign companies to buy homes as simple as for garage British citizens.
For too many people, the dream of their own home is all too far away, and the humiliation of homelessness remains all too real.”
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to run Scotland"
Sunderland's boss, Jack Ross, said his "final goal" was to become manager of Scotland.
The 42-year-old Scotland enjoys the challenge of reviving North-East, which currently occupies third place in the First League, with three points less than the first-ranked.
He moved to the Light Stadium this summer after St Mirren took him back to the Scottish Championships last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that's it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportssound.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden as a child, so it was always something that drew me back.
This opportunity would only be offered to me if I were successful in running the club.”
Ross' predecessors led by Sunderland were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic manager, who had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town, said he had no fear as the heir to such great names.
“Success is measured for me by the question ‘Can I bring this club back to the First League?’”
“Given the structure and capabilities, this club is undoubtedly part of the First League,” he said.
“The way to get there is not easy, but it would probably only be considered a success if the club could get back there.”
Ross has been a manager for only three years, after being assistant manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month coaching staff of the Hearts.
Alloi then helped prevent a third-league outbreak, and St Mirren led to the championship title in the following season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than ever while playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was probably a real breakthrough,” Alloa recalled.
“I was really convinced that management was the right thing for me, much more than playing.
It sounds ridiculous because I was doing well as a player, with this I had a relatively good time and also achieved some major successes.
But the game can become demanding.
You have to face a lot of things every week.
I still struggle with this in terms of stress and pressure at work, but management simply feels like the right thing for me.
I’ve always wanted to lead a club and I’m doing it now. I feel more comfortable in my skin all my adult life now.”

The result of the survey: the ideal time for beer is on Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat has increased the revenues of British bars that are hard to break, but the pressure on restaurant chains has also increased.
Groups of pubs and bars increased sales by 2.7 per cent in July, but restaurant revenues declined by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, CGA’s business advisor who compiled the data, said: “The continued sunny weather and England’s participation in the World Cup, which lasted longer than expected, meant that July was following a similar pattern as June, when the revenues of the previous month, when the revenues of the year, when the revenues of the year, was only 2nd.
The decline in restaurant traffic by 1.8 percent in June continued to increase in July.
Traffic in pubs and bars with drinks increased more compared to the decrease in traffic in restaurants.
Due to the sunny weather, sales in pubs, which mainly offer food, have also decreased, but not as dramatic as restaurant managers.
It seems that people just wanted to go for a drink.
In various pubs and bars, sales of beverages increased by 6.6 percent in one month, and food sales declined by three percent.”
Paul Newman of RSM’s leisure and hospitality analysts said: “These results are continuing the trend we’ve been seeing since the end of April.
When selling in the hospitality market, the biggest factor remains the weather and the influence of major social or sporting events.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to fight, although a fall of 4.8 percent in the mid-year level will be particularly painful due to constant cost pressures.
For owners of restaurants with long hot summer food could not come at a more inappropriate time and only time will tell whether the recovery needed will bring the moderate temperatures we experienced in August.

One in five children has a secret account on social media that they hide from their parents.
The study found that one in five children — some of them only 11 years old — have a secret account on social networks that they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 students showed the growth of fake Instagram pages
News has heightened fears of publishing sex-related content
Twenty percent of students say they have a “main” account that is intended for parents.
One in five children – some of whom are only 11 years old – create an account on social networks that they hide from their parents.
A survey of 20,000 students showed a rapid growth in fake Instagram accounts.
The news has heightened fears of publishing sex-related content.
Twenty percent of students said they run censored “main” accounts that they show to parents, and they also have private accounts.
The mother, who accidentally encountered the secret side of the 13-year-old daughter, noticed that the daughter invited visitors to rape her.
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors and Directors of Independent Schools (HMC) found that 40 percent of 11-18-year-olds have two profiles, half of whom admit they have a private account.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: “It is worrying that so many teenagers are subjected to temptation and create an online space where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the ‘voice of athletes’ of the Scottish Athletics Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as the non-executive director of the Annual General Assembly of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is the most distinguished Scottish athlete in the field and outdoors, and President Ian Beattie described this move as a great opportunity for those who direct sports to take advantage of her extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh enjoys a lot of respect in the Scottish, British and global athletics community. We are confident that athletics in Scotland would be a huge gain with its inclusion on the board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I’m excited to be able to act as a voice for athletes, and I hope to be able to really contribute and help to lead sports in Scotland.”
The American, who won from a total of four Olympic medals in the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and is now a regular commentator for the BBC, has remained speechless after a transitional ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I was hit by a drop.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will be able to recover and to what extent.
The work was hard, but I recovered completely, learned to walk again and today I practice exercises for agility!
“Thank you for all the encouraging messages!”
Breast pump ad comparing mothers with cows has shared online reviews
The company that produces breast pumps has shared opinions with an ad that compares mothers with cows at the mouth.
To launch the “first silent portable breast pump,” consumer technology company Elvie has released a provocative music video ad that is supposed to show mothers all the freedom that the appliance provides.
Four real mothers dance in the company of cows in a litter filled with ashes, on a song that includes the following text: “Yes, I’m pumping, but there’s no tail,” and “If you haven’t noticed, it’s not my tits, it’s my tits.”
The choir continues: “Exhaust, exhaust, feed the baby, exhaust, exhaust, push the breasts.”
But the ad, which was posted on Facebook’s website, has caused considerable discomfort on the internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from spectators, with many saying it was a joke at the expense of the “horrible” dairy industry.
“Using cows to advertise this product is a very bad decision.
Like me, they get pregnant and scoop to produce milk, but their babies are stolen from them in the first days after scooping,” she wrote.

Another commented: “Of course it’s traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But why not use them to advertise breast pumps for mothers who are keeping their children?”
Someone else added, “You sound completely unfeeling.”
Others praised the ad, with one of the women admitting that she thought the song “was funny.”
“I think that’s a brilliant idea.
I would have bought it if I were still breastfeeding.
When I was pumping, I felt exactly like a cow.
The ad is a bit crazy, but I understood it as it was meant.
“It’s a great product,” she wrote.
Someone commented, “This is a funny ad that targets mothers who are exhausting their milk (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like cows.”
This is not an advertisement that would praise or condemn the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they were dancing with hidden pumps in a broomstick.
The concept of action is that many women who pump their breasts say they feel like cows.
The Elvie Pump is completely silent, does not have a wire or tube and is discreetly fit in the breastfeeding socket, allowing women to move, hold the child and even engage in outdoor activities while pumping milk.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD in mothers, further commented: “Elvie’s pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative presentation.”
With the pull of a parallel between women pumping their milk, and cows dairy cows, we wanted to put the pumping of milk and all its challenges in the spotlight, while at the same time in a fun way, with which women can connect, show an incredible sense of freedom, which will be lit by the new pump.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has come to the front page.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children took a walk on the model path for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Migrants Silently Moved to Tent Camp on the Texas Border
The number of migrant children detained has increased considerably, even though the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the rough rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to hand the children over to sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors are undocumented migrants, so they fear that by applying for a child, their own chances of staying in the country will be compromised.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other family members of households would have to pass fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Agency, testified before the congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had requested sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had no prior criminal records.
“Almost 80 percent of people who are either sponsors or household members of sponsors are illegal in the country, and a large proportion of them are penalised foreigners.
That’s why we continue to look for these individuals,” said Mr. Albence.
In order to treat children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within one month of being detained, and not 60 days later, which was the previous standard, workers in custody said.
Many will appear with a videoconferencing call and not in person to defend themselves before an immigration judge.
Those who are deemed not eligible for assistance will be expelled quickly.
The longer the children are in detention, the more likely they become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape after the statements of the workers in the shelters and reports that have been generated in the system in recent months.
Proponents said these concerns are greater at larger institutions, such as Tornilla, where signs of child distress due to their size are more likely to remain unnoticed.
They added that moving children into a tent town without emotionally preparing them for it or giving them the opportunity to speak from friends can complicate the trauma that many of them face.
Syria calls on U.S., French and Turkish "occupied forces" to withdraw immediately
In a speech by the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moual urged Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country has been at war for eight years.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces on Syrian soil were illegal, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they would "proceed accordingly".
“They must resign immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem said the “war on terrorism” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have had to leave their homes, was “almost over.”
He said Damascus would continue to “fight this holy battle until we clear the Syrian territory” of both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United Nations has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on its territory during the war.
With regard to refugees, Moualem said the conditions were appropriate for their return, and blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading unreasonable fears" that convinced refugees to remain abroad.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to contribute to their easier return,” he said.
“They are changing into a political issue, which should be an exclusive humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned Syria not to receive renewal funds until Assad and the opposition reach an agreement on an end to the war.
United Nations diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a tampon zone in the last major rebel base, Idlib, has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has prevented a large-scale attack by Syrian forces backed by Russia on a province in which three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the deal had a “strong hand” and expressed hope that military intervention would be directed against the jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front linked to Al Qaeda, who “will be eradicated.”
The United Nations deputy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first session of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to prepare a post-war constitution for Syria and push the way for elections.
Moualem defined the conditions for the Syrian government to participate in the committee, saying the committee's work should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Achieve Second Mandate
Following this conclusion, Trump will win the 2020 re-election unless, as many liberal spectators likely hope, his presidency ends prematurely with an interpellation and scandal.
That would be “the most dramatic finale of the presidency ever!”
There are no signs of tiredness of the spectators.
Since 2014, CNN’s viewing has more than doubled to 1.05 million at the time of the biggest viewing, and MSNBC’s viewing has almost tripled to 1.6 million.
The Fox News channel has an average of 2.4 million viewers at the time of viewing, which is more than four years ago, according to Nielsen, when it had 1.7 million, and The Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC has reached the highest number of cable customers with 3.5 million viewers.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, director of Designated Survivor, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a renowned comedian and author of the book “Just Funny Parts: And Some Hard Truths About Spying at the Hollywood Boys’ Club,” offers a different explanation.
Remember a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he'd vote for Mr. Trump.
Why, she asked.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” said Mrs. Scovell.
There's a fun value in chaos.
Of course, contrary to what is seen on television, the story from Washington could decide on the future of the Roe v. Wad case based on whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.

When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week, outside his home on the north coast of Kaua'i, it was sunny 80 degrees (26.7 degrees Celsius), but he was overlooked inside watching MSNBC while filming CNN.
He couldn't get out of his way, even when Brett Kavanaugh faced the Senate Committee and hung the future of the Supreme Court in the air.
“I remember when we created all these crazy shows and people said, ‘This is the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right.”

External money gets in preparation for the closest interim parliamentary elections
It is no surprise that there is a flood of money in the 17th Pensilvania district, as two candidates were in a race for the same seat due to the reorganization of the congressional districts.
This recently in a newly divided suburban district of Pittsburgh is home to Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in a special election this spring in another district.
Lamb competes with another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsilvanian 12th District, which is heavily overlapping with the new 17th District.
The maps were recast when the Pennsylvanian Supreme Judge ruled in January that the old districts were illegally rebuilt in favor of Republicans.
The match in the new 17th district touched on the fight to fund the campaign between the main party financial telesomas, the Congressional Committee for Democratic Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Republican Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the widely-accompanied March special elections for the 18th District of Pennsylvania.
This seat has been occupied by Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump has won the district by 20 points.
Political commentators give Democrats a slight advantage.
In the U.S., they were considering sanctions against Salvador because of China’s support, and then resigned.
Diplomats have found that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a hot meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varelo in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partners expelled Trump’s leadership.
Foreign ministry officials have decided to resign U.S. heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to conspiring against “recent decisions to cease recognition of Taiwan,” Heather Nauert, a ministerial spokeswoman, said in a statement earlier this month.
But they were considering sanctions against Salvador, which is estimated to receive <0x24>140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including aid to combat drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included restrictions on financial assistance and targeted visa issuance restrictions, would greatly affect this Central American country with high unemployment and the number of murders.
During internal meetings, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic development to continue a similar meeting last year, which was assessed as a step forward in preventing migration towards the United States.
By mid-September, the top government officials had explained that they wanted the conference to continue, concluding their thinking on penalties for Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now in charge of addressing the participants of the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, which is a sign of the importance attributed by the U.S. government to the meeting, the diplomats added.
Three U.S. envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new hard messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton refused to comment on the details of the discussion described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to talk about them on condition of anonymity.
Their testimony was confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the government and also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Historical Comparisons
The next unpleasant news could be the report by Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of the judiciary, which is already very much evidence in the public records.
Mr. Mueller is also expected to focus the investigation on whether Mr. Trump’s campaign was cooperating with Russia in the attack on the US election.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will have to answer before the authorities and perhaps even before the jury of his colleagues just as he prepares to speak to his voters again.
There are a lot of questions in this regard and I do not want to say that Mr Trump's fall is unavoidable, nor are his peers in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we will have to make decisions that will affect how long the battle could take.
In 1938, German officials were ready to attack Hitler if the West rebelled against him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We did not succeed, thereby missing the opportunity to avoid the year of slaughter that followed.
At such breakthroughs, the course of history changes and accelerates or slows down the relentless course of democracy.
Americans are faced with several such breakthroughs right now.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a man who has the fate of Mueller's investigation in his hands?
Rosenstein has been in a hurry since this officer reported last year that he proposed a secret recording of the president and speculated about his inadequacy for this position.
Mr. Rosenstein said the report of The Times was inaccurate.
“How will we respond if the FBI investigation required by Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or fair, or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court despite credible charges of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the interim elections for a congress that will demand Mr Trump’s responsibility?
If we fail in these trials, then a long winter of democracy awaits us.
But I'm sure it won't hurt us because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she ordered me to light the Sabbath candles on a swastika table.
How can we not be so optimistic about our future?”

Ranger Graham Dorrans optimistic to face Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, making it clear that their victory over the Austrians after an impressive rally against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month will put them in a convincing position to qualify for Group G European League.
The knee injury prevented tied player Graham Dorrans from appearing for the first time in the season before a 2–2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use it as a leap for greater achievements.
“This was a deserved point for us because Villarreal is a strong team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We have entered the game in the belief that we can achieve something and take the point.
You might be able to win in the end, but in general, the remi is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, but we showed up and we were better in the second half.
There will be another big European night on Thursday.
We hope we can get three points, but this will be a difficult game because they have achieved a good result in the last game, but I am confident with the crowd behind us that we can try and achieve a positive result.
The past year has been undoubtedly difficult, given everything that has happened, including injuries and changes in the club itself, but I have a good feeling about this place now.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope we can continue now, leave the last season behind and achieve success.”
Women's poor sleep due to fear of savings
Despite the fact that the respondents had a clear idea of how to take care of them, few people were talking to their family members about it.
Half of the survey respondents at Nationwide said that their spouses are talking about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t try to talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
You can start the following way.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare the family to take care of you if you don’t talk to her about it in time.
Talk to your counselor and family about where and how you want to receive care, as this can be an important factor in cost assessment.
Include a financial advisor: Your financial advisor can help you find a way to pay for these costs.
Your choice of financing long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a combination of cash value and life insurance policy to cover these costs, or self-insurance with your own funds, if you can afford it.
Prepare the necessary legal documents: Prepare for legal battles during the transition.
Choose a health care provider by identifying a trusted person who will supervise your health care and ensure that professionals will take into account your health wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also consider the authorization of a person for your finances.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your accounts will be paid if you are not able to do it yourself.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent urgently needs medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about allergies and medications?
Write this information into the action plan so that you are ready.
“It’s not just about your finances. Do you know doctors?” Martin asked.
“What medications are you taking?
Who will take care of the dog?
I have this plan ready.”

A man who returned home at night was shot several times with an air rifle.
The shooter, in the 1940s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracomb, Devon, when he was shot several times in the chest, stomach, and arm.
Police described the shooting, which took place around 2:30 p.m. in the UK, as an “accidental act.”
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have called on potential witnesses to report.
Tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to increase.
With broken communications, rescuers from the regent of Donggala, the area north of Palu, closest to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were unable to obtain any information.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the earthquake.
Some key information about Palu and Donggal in Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi, a province that lies at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi and is estimated to have 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrates the 40th anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a province that stretches over more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline on the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The Regency, an administrative unit under the province, had an estimated population of 299,000 in 2017.
The main economic activities of the Central Sulawesi region are fisheries and agriculture, especially in the central region of Donggala.
In the province, nickel mining is also an important activity, but mainly takes place in Moroval, on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Agency for Natural Disaster Relief, the tsunami has hit Palu and Donggal several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, the tsunami also struck northern Dongganga and killed nine people.
Indonesia is sitting on an earthquake-active Pacific Fire Ring, so earthquakes are regularly occurring here.
In recent years, some major earthquakes and tsunamis have been as follows:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A type of strong earthquake hit Western Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck the southernmost island of Java, Indonesia, and triggered a tsunami that flooded its southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 occurred near Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit one of the islands of Mentawai and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: An earthquake hit the Pidie Jay regency in Aceh, causing death and panic as people recalled the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time the tsunami did not trigger, but the collapse of the building caused more than 100 deaths.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily detained thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
A 29-year-old man from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of domestic violence and opposition to arrest, Alaska State Troopers police said on Saturday.
According to a police report, Palin, when she tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, took the phone off the hand.
Palin was detained at the Mat-Su Predcasting Institute and is in custody under an uninsured <0x24>500 security guarantee, the KTU television network reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, stating he was "absolutely uncovered" when asked about his defense, the network said.
Fuel was charged with three A-Class offences, which means he could be imprisoned for up to one year and fined <0x24>250,000.
He was also charged with one B-class offence, which is punishable by one day in prison and a fine of <0x24>2,000.
Palin has not been charged for the first time.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, interference in the reporting of domestic violence, and possession of an alcoholic weapon in connection with the incident.
Palin's girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
In 2016, veteran groups criticized Sarah Palin for linking her son’s violent behavior to a post-traumatic stress disorder after returning from military service in Iraq.
Tsunami earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people died in an earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been disrupted, and the number of deaths is expected to continue to increase in the coming days.
The quake occurred just outside central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos are circulating on social media that show the moment of the earthquake.
When a tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people were detained at a beach festival in the town of Palu.
Federal Prosecutors Rarely Call for Death Penalty for Suspect of Terrorist Attack in New York
The federal prosecutors in New York are demanding the death penalty for Saiful Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people. This is a rare sentence that has not been carried out for federal crime in the country since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is said to have used a leased delivery truck to carry out a cycling trail attack along the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan, when he drove several pedestrians and cyclists in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saip's "intentional" murder of eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily injuries, it is stated in a statement on the request for the death penalty filed in the South District of New York.
According to the court document, the death penalty can be the reason for any of the charges.
Several weeks after the attack, a large federal jury of Saipo met with the prosecutor in 22 points, which included eight murder charges in support of rape, usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and a charge of rape and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “significant planning and intent,” prosecutors said, describing Saip’s approach as “stupid, cruel and sincere.”
Sayfullo Habibulaevic Saipov has caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drak, Ariel Erli, Hernán Ferruchi, Hernán Diego Mendoza, and Alejandra Damian Pag.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The District Court for Southern District passed the last death sentence 10 years ago.
Accused Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers and eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last imposed in New York City in a federal case in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed for conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were killed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, did not show any remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to the court documents.
According to police, he told investigators he was feeling good about what he had done.
According to the prosecutor, Saip told the authorities that he was inspired by ISIS videos he watched on his phone to carry out the attack.
Police also said that he requested the disclosure of the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
With respect to 22 points of the indictment, he said he was innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal public prosecutors representing Saip, said they were “obviously disappointed” with the prosecution’s decision.
“We believe that a decision to demand the death penalty instead of admitting guilt in return for life in prison without the possibility of release for all involved will only prolong the suffering associated with these events,” Patton said.
Saip's defense group has previously asked prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Negotiations on brexit should be entrusted to NIGEL FARAGE, true Tori MP
Nigel Farage today, during a protest at the Tory Conference, promised to "mobilize the People's Army".
Former Ukipa leader said politicians should “feel the heat” of Eurosceptics when one of his own MPs, Therese May, suggested that she should be in charge of negotiating with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said on a trip to Birmingham that the United Kingdom would be “already out” if he were secretary for Mr Farage’s Brexit.
But the challenge that Mr. Mayeva faces in coordinating his deeply divided species has also been highlighted by the Tories, who are in favour of renouncing the brexit, who have joined the separate protest against the brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to keep her plan on track between the attacks of Brexit supporters, Brexit opponents and the EU.
The Allies insisted that Maya will try to reach an agreement in Brussels despite opposition and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and “chaos”.
Mr. Bone is at the Leave Means Leave convention in Solihula that he “desires to get rid of the Chequers.”
He said that we should appoint Mr Farage as the interlocutor and assign him responsibility for negotiating with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, he would have been out by now," he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I will support the Brexit, but we must get rid of the Chequers."
He described his opposition to the EU in the following words: “In world wars, we did not fight to be servants now.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bone rejected the proposal that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their mind and want to stay in the EU is completely unrealistic.”
Andrea Jenkyns, a Turkish brexit speaker, said to the rapporteurs: “I am simply saying: ‘Minister President, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, and it is also unpopular with our party and our activists, who are active in the streets and lead us to the election.
Please leave the Chequers and start listening.”
In a message addressed to Ms Mayeva, she added: “The prime ministers keep their job when they keep their promises.”
Farage said at the summit that politicians should be given a “feeling of heat” if they intend to make the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“It’s now a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to deliver a brexit, and today we’ve gathered to tell them, ‘We won’t let you do that.’”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want to make our political class on the verge of brexit issuance feel the heat.”
“We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country, which has guaranteed us victory in the Brexit, and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous, proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, the remnants marched through Birmingham, where they then had a two-hour meeting in downtown.
A handful of activists have set up the group this weekend a mahalo with Torii flags against the brexit.
Labour nobility Lord Adonis laughed at conservatives because of security issues with the party's application after the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who are telling us that they can set up IT systems and all the technology to agree Canada plus plus, for a border-free, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“This is a perfect farce.
There is no such thing as a good brexit,” he added.
Warren’s move to the presidency will “study closely”
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “study the participation in the presidential race” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a meeting with citizens in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is often critical of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was Trump's co-president of the 2016 Massachusetts election campaign.
It is at the center of speculation that it could deal with Trump in 2020.
The Holyoke event on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters in the form of a “town hall” since Trump became president.
One of the participants asked her if she was going to run for president.
Warren replied that it is time for “women to go to Washington and fix our corrupt government, which demands a woman at the top.”
Arrest after death of LSU player Sims in shooting
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said on Saturday that the suspect was arrested for shooting LSU basketball player Wayd Sims.
Baton Rougu police station reported the arrest of 20-year-old Simpson at a press conference at 11 p.m.
They posted a video of Friday's shooting and asked for help identifying the man on the video.
A 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed early Friday near the campus of South University.
"Wayde Sims suffered a shot in the head and eventually died," police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters, 247sports.
Wayde intervened to protect a friend, and Simpson shot him.
At the hearing, Simpson admitted that he was at the end of the incident, that he had a gun and that he shot Wayd Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 198-centimeter youngster who grew up in Baton Rougu, played 32 games with 10 starts last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 leaps per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaching the title of World Champion and the team ordered him to give the win to Sebastian Vettla
On Saturday, when Valtteri Boltas qualified against Lewis Hamilton, it became clear that “the Mercedes team will have a strong influence on the race.”
Bottas started well at the start and almost left Hamilton on dry as he defended his position in the first two laps and invited Vettle to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to get into boxing and let Hamilton drive at the traffic lane, which should be decisive.
Mercedes drove into the box later and left behind Vettle, but after a few drives, Hamilton noticed that the Ferrari driver's indifference leaves the inside open and risking to fall behind after two moves to defend in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started with the last type of net and was seventh on his 21st birthday until the end of the first round.
Then most of the race was cars without tyre change, as he intended to perform a quick finish, overtake Kimi Raikkonen and occupy fourth place.
In boxing, he finally finished in the 44th round, but was unable to increase speed in the remaining eight rounds, so Raikkonen took fourth place.
It’s a tough day, as Valtteri drove fantastically the whole weekend and was a real knight when he let me out.
"The team has done a really great job of reaching first and second place," Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a hearing on Saturday over her insistence that she did not disclose a letter to Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
At the West Virginia summit, the president did not directly touch Ford’s testimony before the Senate inquiry commission, but instead said that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are “bad, corrupt and false.”
“The only beautiful thing that can happen and that has happened in the Senate in the last few days that we can see anger when we can see that people are evil, corrupt, and lying,” he said.
“When you look at the announcements and revelations, people say, ‘No, I didn’t do that.’”
I didn't do that."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you reveal it?
Remember her answer ... you revealed the document – ‘Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn’t reveal it.”
All right, hold on a second.
We revealed it to us... No, we didn’t,” he added regarding the impression of the senator.
Ford sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and it was revealed to the media in early September – but Feinstein denies it came from her office.
“I did not hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I did not disclose her letter,” The Hill Feinstein told the commission.
“She asked me for confidentiality and I kept it as confidential as she asked.”
But her denial apparently did not match the president, who said at a meeting on Saturday night: “I tell you, it was a really bad body language.
It may not be, but it was the worst body rumor I've ever seen."
In defense of a supreme court candidate accused by three women of inappropriate sexual conduct, the president intended Democrats to abuse the charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain their power by all means possible.
“You have seen evil, ugliness, they don’t care who they are hurting and who they have to be driven to power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars vs Belfast Giants: 5:3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Velikane against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars were redeemed for Friday's loss in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants with a 5–3 win in a Saturday match in Dundee.
The Giants scored two goals early on Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie scored for home, and then Dwyer again scored a lead for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard scored for Dundee before two goals from Lundvald Nielsen secured a win.
This was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe, who defeated Dundee by 2-1 on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting of the season between the teams, with the Giants winning in the previous three matches.
Dwyer scored his first goal in the fourth minute with 3:35 assisted by Kendall McFaull, Beauvillier, who scored four minutes later.
In the intensive introductory work, Sullivan brought home again at 13:10, and Matt Marquardt gave it to Cowney for equation at 15:16.
Dwyer took care of the Giants on vacation when he scored his second goal at the end of the first quarter.
The home side gathered again, and Bouchard compensated for the rebound with a strong goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee a lead at the end of the second quarter and secure a win with the fifth goal of his half-time team and secure a win with the fifth goal of his team in the last quarter.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play their next match at home in Milton Keynes on Friday.
Aerial Traffic Controller has killed hundreds of people on a plane to escape from earthquakes
Air traffic controllers in Indonesia are celebrated as a hero after he sacrificed his life so that a plane with hundreds of people could take off safely.
More than 800 people were killed in Friday's tsunami on the island of Sulawesi and many were missing.
The area continues to be stressed by strong aftershocks, and many people are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although the co-workers fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung did not leave his job in a heavily populated control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
It remained in it that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was at the time on the take-off track, could take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower because he thought it was going down.
He died later in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australian media company ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter to take him from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Paula.
“Our heart is broken when we hear it,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach thousands, as the country's disaster relief agency said access to cities in Donggala, Sigiyah and Boutonga was restricted.
“The death toll is expected to increase, as there were many bodies under the debris and many we could not reach,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
The fall, where the mass funeral will take place on Sunday, was devastated by waves up to six meters high.
Military and commercial airplanes provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute a ambulance brings a corpse.
It lacks clean water.
Mini-markets are everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, the head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “Indonesian Red Cross has to hurry to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find.
It’s a tragedy that can get even worse.”
On Sunday, Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu and told the national army: “I ask all of you to work night and day to carry out all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?” according to CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesian plane crash: Air Niugini now says one person is missing after plane crashes in lagoon
The airline, which operated a flight that crashed into the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, now says one person is missing after it was originally reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the drowning plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement on Saturday afternoon that a male passenger was missing.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the missing person.
The call for more information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality, did not respond immediately.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed near the water while trying to land at an airport on Chuuk Island.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said eight passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, all of whom were in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane had landed in the lagoon just in front of the track.
Some witnesses have said the plane missed the track.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed very low.
“That’s very good,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he, along with other passengers, was able to penetrate the water flowing through the belt to the emergency exits on a dive plane.
He said the waitress was panicking and screaming, and he suffered a minor head injury himself.
The U.S. Navy said it was also helped by sailors who repaired the debris in the vicinity. They helped each other with the use of an inflatable boat, with which people were transported to land before the plane sank to about 30 meters (100 boots) deep down.
Aviation Safety Network data show that in the past two decades, 111 people have died in air crashes in Papua New Guinea, but this is the first accident to happen to Air Niugini.
Analyst determines the time of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor's office on Saturday presented his evidence in a retrial to a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett served as an expert on intelligence analysis for several hours.
The jury described how he used phone records to determine the movement of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis and Chambers were on the eve of her death, contradicting his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers at a time when he said he was with a friend Michael Sanford, police turned to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, he said he was "lying because [my] truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks ago when she died.
The footage on the cell phone shows that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said Tellis erased Chambers' texts, calls, and contact details from his phone in the time after Chambers' death.
“He wiped it out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is expected to present its final arguments on Saturday.
The judge said the jury was expected to review the trial later that day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip Hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed group from Bristol claims that hip hop has distanced itself from original political and social engagement.
They want to go back to its roots and make a conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a resurgence in the UK with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York babysitter sues couple for being fired for “racist” message
A New York babysitter sues the couple for discriminating against her after receiving a wrongly sent message from her mother, who complained that she was “one more black.”
The couple denies racist behavior and compares the lawsuit to “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her disappointment in 2016 when she found out that the new baby girl, Giselle Maurice, was black.
“NEEEEEEEEEEE IS A BLACK ONE,” she wrote to her husband, Plasco-Flaxman.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Mrs. Maurice.
After discovering her collapse, Plasco-Flaxmanova, who felt “unpleasant,” apologized to Mrs. Maurice, stating that her leaving nurse, an African-American, was doing her job poorly, so she wanted to hire the Philippines, New York Post reported.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for one day of work, and then she was sent home with Uber.
Maurice now demands compensation of <0x24>350 a day from the couple in court for a six-month period to perform the work for which she was initially hired, though without a contract.
“I want to show them, you know, things like that don’t happen,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple responded to allegations of racism by claiming that Maurice's pardon was reasonable, fearing that they would no longer be able to trust her after she was insulted.
“My wife sent me something she didn’t want to say.
She's not racist.
We’re not racist,” Joel Plasco told the Post.
“Would you be willing to trust your children to someone you were rude to, even if it happened by mistake?
Your newborn?
Come on.
When comparing the lawsuit to “displacement,” Plasco said that his wife had given birth to a child just two months ago and was in a “very difficult situation.”
“You’re going to get rid of someone like that?
It’s not very nice,” added the investment banker.
Although proceedings are still pending, the court of public opinion has quickly condemned couples on social media because of their behavior and way of thinking.
Publishers of the story of the Paddington bear were afraid that readers would not connect with the speaking bear, a new letter revealed
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after receiving the book, said of the letter: “It is difficult to put into the skin of someone who first read the book before it was published.
“It’s really fun to find out now that Paddington has become an outstanding success.”
She said her father, who initially worked as a cameraman for the BBC, before being inspired to write a children's book about a little bear toy, was horrified at the rejection of his work, adding that after his death last year it was the 60th anniversary of the book "sweet-sweet".
Regarding Bear Paddington, who described him as “a very important member of our family,” she said that his father was very proud of his ultimate success.
“He was a man who didn’t like to brag,” she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if your child had achieved something: you’re proud of him, even if you don’t really do it yourself.
I think he looked at Paddington's success in a similar way.
Although it was his idea and his imagination, success has always attributed the bear to Paddington himself.
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
On landing, her daughter was taken to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to keep her alive.
“She called on a regular basis to say that she was feeling really bad, that she didn’t expect this to happen,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got Nad’s call, and he told me she was going to die in the next two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you so much, sweetheart.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines that doctors gave her to continue pumping her heart were slowly swallowed and left her system.
She died a while ago, and that was the end of her life.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing that all this was going on.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was in a position when my family and people surrounded me.
I really had to hold on.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan Laperouse, who was already complaining about the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers, unaware of the trials that are over.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“I had a sloping head and tears were on my face all the time.
It's hard to explain, but I felt this strong feeling of compassion for Hope on the plane.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Lamentable female glue posters for suicide prevention on the bridge
Two women, who have lost a loved one because of suicide, try to discourage others to take their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys glue posters on the wagon bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can turn to for support.
The son of Mr. Tyler was 13 years old when he fell into depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parents to feel like I do every day,” she said.
Ms. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile illuminated every room.”
But before he died, he stopped working because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11 years old, was the one who found the spider when he took his life.
Ms. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that the domino effect will be triggered."
Ms. Davis made posters “to let other people know that there are people you can contact and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
“Don’t sit still, you need to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who was Davies' friend for several years, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed or depressed or otherwise,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we saw a change in his behavior.
On Christmas day, he was completely on the floor, and when the children opened the gifts, he didn’t make eye contact with them or anything like that.”
She said that his death was a serious trauma for them, but they had to deal with it: “She broke a hole in the whole family.
She broke us.
But we have to go on and fight.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs on FBI investigation in the air
“I thought that if we could actually get out what he asked for – after a limited investigation, it might be a point,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the world would “disintegrate” due to a tight customer stagnation.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their resistance is a result of the time the investigation would take place.
It is only five weeks until the interim elections on November 6th – if Republicans are badly cut, as expected, this will greatly weaken them in an attempt to elect the desired man to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has repeatedly telephoned senators to lobby in support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and was introduced by him to his current wife Ashley, who is now Bush’s personal secretary.
What will happen when the FBI prepares the report?
The Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will hold a vote.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can collect at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would bring Vice President Mike Pence to a breakthrough from his position and an election to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean refugees has decreased under Kim.
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean deputy said.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to data from the South Korean merger ministry, said 1,127 people had escaped last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the key factors were stricter controls on the North Korean-China border and the price increases required by people's silencers.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly.
The vast majority of refugees from North Korea finally offer South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them cross China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than a heavily protected demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often repatriate them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang at talks that focused on halting denuclearization negotiations.
This happened after a historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they generally agreed on an effort for a Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Jong-ho, attributed the US sanctions to a stalemate since then.
“Without trust from the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and in such circumstances, we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves,” he said in a speech by the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi has labeled Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and says he is not suitable for a job in the Supreme Court.
Nancy Pelosi, a minority head of the House of Representatives, called candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said she was "significantly inappropriate" for a job in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t think of anything other than to label a woman as ‘hysterical’ if she behaved that way,” Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate inquiry committee commented.
Kavanaugh denies the allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when he was a teenager.
In the introductory statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, he was almost screaming occasionally, and breathing in discussions about his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the commission and labeled the charges against himself as "gross and coordinated smuggling" organised by liberals, angry because Hillary Clinton lost in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that she felt that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not be appointed to the Supreme Court, as it proved that he was partial to the Democrats.
“I think he discredited himself with such statements and the way Clinton and the Democrats marched,” she said.
Pelosi is asked if she will try to file a constitutional charge against Kavanaugha if she is confirmed and the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives, she will become for a moment.
“I’ll say this – if Congress or the FBI don’t tell the truth, it’s inappropriate not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where it is now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington.
Pelosi said she was concerned as a Democrat by Kavanaugh’s possible decision against the Accessibility Health Care Act or Roe’s case against Wad, as she is considered a conservative judge.
In his affirmative hearings, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would annul certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“Now is not the time for a hysterical, partial person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Isn’t that wonderful?’” she said.
And a woman must be kidnapped.
It is a fair fall, after months and years of shedding anger, and cannot be expressed without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s rare, what do you think?”
She continued: “A woman who was a director somewhere, who was also crying when she was angry, but developed a technique, that is, when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, ‘Maybe I feel sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she simply continued.
It seemed to me to be top-notch.”
Tears are a way out of anger, partly because people misunderstand them.
One of my strongest memories of my early career, when I was still working in an office where men were dominant, and I once found myself crying in inexpressible anger, was the event when an older woman grabbed me behind my neck – a cold leader who was not always afraid of me.
“Never let them see you crying,” she said.
“They won’t understand that you’re angry.
They’ll think you’re sad, and they’ll be glad they’ve touched you.”
Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, collaborated with Gary Hart on his presidential nomination.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught jumping over the fence in a boat called Monkey Business and had to step out of the game, Schroeder found deep shocked that there was no reason why she could not run for president herself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she laughed 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates in the match, and one more was the last thing needed at the time.
At the time, the game was called ‘Snowfly and the Seven Inches’.
Since the campaign was the last to join, it was lagging behind in fundraising, so she decided not to enter the game unless she raised <0x24>2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave <0x24>1,000 to men, only gave her <0x24>250.
“Do you think I’ll get a discount?” she asked.
When she said in the conversation that she was not going to start an official campaign, her emotions – gratitude to the people who supported her, dissatisfaction with the system that made her so difficult to raise money and focus on the voters instead of the delegates, and anger over sexism – she was so overcome.
“You would think I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalled the reactions of the media.
“We would have thought that my official sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking about what they would write on my grave.
‘But she was crying?’
How the U.S.-China War Could Benefit Beijing
The beginnings of the trade war between the United States and China have been overwhelming, and although the battle hasn’t ended long ago, experts say the gap between the countries could be of long-term benefit to Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump launched the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese export items, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with new tariffs on goods worth <0x24>200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively imposing half of all goods coming to the US from China.
Beijing has revenged each time with equivalent retaliatory measures, lastly with tariffs of 5 to 10 percent on U.S. goods worth <0x24>60 billion.
China, the world’s second-largest economy, has pledged to move eye to eye with the U.S. and probably won’t get confused anytime soon.
In order for Washington to resign, China would have to accept his demands, but the U.S. public removal of Chinese President Xi Jinping would be too embarrassing.
Experts say, however, that if Beijing knew how to pull the right moves, U.S. pressure in the trade war could have a long-term positive impact on China by reducing the interdependence of both economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would trigger an economic turmoil in any of the countries is actually much more dangerous than observers thought so far,” said Abigail Grace, a new co-worker at the Center for Security and Security.
Syria is ‘ready’ to return refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready to voluntarily return refugees, and asks for help in restoring a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
In a speech by the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moualem said that the situation in the country is improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer due to the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to sanitize areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normal conditions.
Now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country, who had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and survival, are met.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
The other six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid in the restoration of the devastated country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from the countries that sponsored the rebels.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
With a win against the United States, the European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National in Paris, France.
The U.S. has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup since 1993.
Europe again won the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached 14.5 points needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had problems through most of the championship, knocked the ball in the water at his initial knock on the 16th hole in a pair-3 game, which forced him to hand the game over to Francesca Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has been shining through all rounds and has become one of four players who have scored 5-0-0 at any time since the start of the championship in the current form in 1979.
With 5 and 4, Jordan Spieth defeated the European team's lowest-ranked player, Thorbjorn Olesen, from Denmark.
World's best-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England, who may have played last time in Ryder's podium.
Eight Ryder Cup veteran, Spanish Sergio Garcia, with 25.5 points, became the most successful European player in the championship of all time.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t help myself today.
This year has been hard.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for raising me and trusting you.
I'm so happy, I'm so happy we won the cup again.
It’s a team and I’m really happy to be able to help,” Garcia said emotionally after the European victory.
Stafeto is handing over to cousin John Ram, who defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday with 2 and 1.
“I’m incredibly proud to be able to beat Tiger Woods. When I grew up, I watched his games,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all four games in France, and now has a career record in Ryder's 13-21-3 podium.
This is an unusual statistic for one of the greatest players of all time who has won 14 great titles, right behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team worked tirelessly for a week to find the right path, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have been playing golf at a high level throughout the entire championship.
After a bad performance for his team, the American captain said, “I’m so proud of these guys, they fought.”
In the morning, we put a little pressure on Europe.
We're out of our way.
The hood down in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're going to have to get together again, I'm going to cooperate with the PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're going to move on.
I really love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
Head down.

Red tide news: Concentrations off the coast of the Pinellas, Manatee and Saratosa districts are declining
A recent report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) shows a general reduction in red tide concentrations in parts of the Gulf of Tampa.
The FWC Commission has reported more dispersed flowering in the Pinellas, Manatee, Saratosa, Charlotte and Collier districts, indicating a reduction in concentrations.
The red tide extends approximately 130 miles from the northern coast of Pinellas County to the southern Lee County.
Payments are seen about 10 miles from the coast of Hillsborough County, but in fewer places than last week.
A red tide was also observed in the district of Pasco.
In the past week, it has been reported that there are medium concentrations in the County of Pinellas and its coastline, low to high concentrations near the Hillsborough County coastline, basic to high concentrations in the County of Manatee, basic to high concentrations in the County of Saratosa, and high concentrations in the County of Saratosa, and around the County of Lebaly.
Breath irritation continues to be reported from Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier districts.
No respiratory irritation was reported from Northwestern Florida last week.
