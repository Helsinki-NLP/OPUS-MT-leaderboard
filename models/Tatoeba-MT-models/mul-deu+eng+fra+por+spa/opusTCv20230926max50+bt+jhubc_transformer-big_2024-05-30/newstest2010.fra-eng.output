Barack Obama to be the fourth U.S. president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo, Norway, to spend 26 hours there and be the fourth U.S. president in history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
The <0x24>1.4 million diploma, medal and cheque will be awarded, among other things, for its outstanding efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and collaboration among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife, Michelle, will land in the morning in the Norwegian metropolis and have a busy program.
He will first visit the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time the five members of the Committee who elected him in October from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The couple’s presidential schedule then includes an interview with King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonja.
The visit will reach its summit in the afternoon at a solemn ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth U.S. president to receive the award, but only the third to receive the award in the Committee's own chairmanship.
The White House informed in advance that Obama would talk about the war in Afghanistan during the award ceremony.
The president does not want to avoid this issue because he is aware that he is receiving this award by being a president who is leading a war in two countries at the moment.
He reinforced the war effort a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which none of his critics will forget to underline.
During the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a check of ten million Swedish crowns (about 1.1 million Euros).
He intends to donate it to charities, but he has not yet decided which.
His program will then take him and his wife to a banquet including, in addition to the king and queen of Norway, the head of government and 250 other guests.
Obama was rather reluctant at this price at the beginning.
He mentioned, for example, having the feeling that he did not deserve it fully.
He has also repeated several times that it is not a prize for himself alone, but for all those who defend the same values as him.
As of the announcement, he said it would be for him an “invitation to act”.
A nature defender accused of blackmail
Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice police have accused the president of the association Society of Nature Protectors of Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice of blackmailing.
Several times last year he appealed for several construction site procedures and asked for money from investors for his personal profit in exchange for the withdrawal of his appeal, said Alena Romová, a spokeswoman for Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice police.
The president of the Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice Society of Nature Protectors is Lubomír Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
He is currently in detention and runs the risk of up to three years in prison.
Waste sorting beans are not perfumed in Brno
In Prague everyone can sort their beverage packaging, while in the villages of South Moravia you fall on sorting beams at every corner of the street.
What about Brno?
There, it would take you several minutes before finding the right beams.
I do not mean that we would not sort the waste at all in Brno.
But I have the impression that the municipal councilors of our city, the second largest city in the country, are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is in the stone age of sorting waste not only because citizens can still sort only paper, glass and PVC, but especially because of the number of buckets dedicated to these wastes.
Have you ever tried to throw a plastic bottle in the city center?
It’s all a science, which requires more time and nerves than steel.
The only place I have found so far is the place of Moravia in front of Potrefena Husa.
That Mr. Underka and his colleagues don't want me to, but I don't think so much.
Not to mention the fact that in other parts of the city it is not a sinecure either.
In the end, many of my friends don’t sort their waste.
It's a paresse.
It makes them a trot to get to the bennes.
I'm not surprised by them.
I myself, after a party, proposed to go throw a few bottles of glass and PVC.
Except I didn't see any colored benna street Kounicova.
Fortunately, I found the right place to take the tram.
That said, the waste was overflowing.
After all, it is the center of Brno, which is supposed to best represent the city, right?!
It is likely that ecology and alleged aestheticism are not too interested in Brno’s socialists.
They prefer to buy in the city a first-class hockey league that embarrasses the city all over the country, rather than buying a few extra beans and offering the sorting of more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am happy to have been able to comfort my impression with official statistics after pulling a moment on the internet.
According to data from the company EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the entire region of South Moravia.
Paroubek’s budget has removed Argentine retirees and sick leave
After the left has increased, despite the government's opinion, farmers or officials may be lacking money for pensions, sick leave or housing savings.
But also for interest on state debt or international judicial proceedings.
This will increase the problems of those who are going to rule in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the social democrats and communists imposed the increase for certain classes, they relied on the fact that the government would make loans for sensitive spending, retirement or sick leave. "It's just putting the problems back later, mining the ground," Janota said.
It should be noted that on the money borrowed the interest to be paid is increasing and that it will have to be returned sooner or later.
The state doesn’t really have the choice to know where to get money.
If it does not reduce social aid or its expenses, it will have to increase taxes.
To all those that the left has now increased: the firefighters, the teachers, the farmers.
And then, to their children.
People will touch them and should not be afraid for their pensions or health insurance, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of a greater debt of the state - next year it will not be missing 163 billion in cash, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will thus grow faster and with it, interest-related expenditures.
The state will need money to repay it and it will no longer be enough to slightly increase VAT or decrease maternity leave as the government did in its anti-deficit package.
There will also be <0x24>5 billion to complete the construction of roads and railways due to the transfer of money to a few groups of voters.
These are mainly already determined and initiated sections where it is not possible to modify projects in order to potentially reduce costs.
At least keep them, which is not free either.
This means delaying or stopping thirty major construction sites, and the withdrawal of European funds is also at risk, according to Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD has proposed to solve the financial deficit very properly - it will put in the dividends of the <0xC4><0x8C>EZ (electric power supplier and distributor), which the state largely owns and will feed the transport fund.
The concern is that the amount of dividends is never certain and that it is in no way a bottomless pit.
Last year, 18 billion were navigated from the <0xC4><0x8C>EZ to the budget.
Each year, dividends are used to pay off environmental damage, to supplement pension accounts, or as a reserve for the pension reform that is being prepared.
In addition, this tip increases the actual budget deficit by 5.7 percent of GDP according to EU rules.
And it's far from the end of the transfer carnival.
The budget for various compensations to victims of communism and crimes, or even housing savings, has fallen by almost three billion.
It is not certain that the state can act without this money.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international procedure, we will have to pay anyway, says Janota.
The minister will then have to save on the department side or, at worst, touch the government's budget reserve.
One hundred million is also missing in the <0x24>2 billion project, which should allow online monitoring of the expenditures of each administration.
The first step will begin in January.
If the finance minister did not find any money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and sanctions would take place, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
In the future, Americans are considering a mobile phone that will allow the user to switch from one operating system to another by pressing a single button.
The projects that have been revealed seem promising.
Just a button and you switch from Windows Mobile to Android in a few seconds.
It is precisely this possibility that is the goal of the American company VMware, which mainly deals with the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles simultaneously on your mobile phone.
You can alternate between them, you can differentiate them in personnel and professional
Both will work at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware in an interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and a first demonstration was made a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones is not in any way a part of fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented a trial version to journalists, a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
This is a modified Nokia N800 with 128 MB of RAM, which simultaneously runs the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is on the rise.
VMware is now collaborating with European and American operators to test virtualization on smartphones, and customers are expected to have access to the current devices in 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains disturbs hoteliers
Desert tracks are not a problem only for bridge-lift operators.
The lack of snow discourages people from booking their ski stays in hotels and pensions.
As a result, it is always possible to locate free rooms for all dates in winter, including Christmas and New Year.
We have a lot of visits on our site.
Internet users are browsing the offers, asking for prices but do not dare to commit to booking for the moment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if there will be snow or mud at Christmas," said Martin Jandura, who operates the information portal Spindl.Info.
If you want to spend the New Year of your dreams in <0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v Ml<0xC3><0xBD>n, it is better not to hesitate to book.
If you give priority to savings and the quality of accommodation comes only afterwards, then you can try to wait a few more days.
Hoteliers in <0xC5><0xA0>pindler currently offer only one week stays for the New Year.
I think they will try to place them for another moment, but they will also give up and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will quickly decrease,” Jandura said.
The tourism agency Ingtours du Vrchlabí also offers free beds for all winter seasons.
We are most interested in Christmas week at the moment, it is not completely sold.
There is still, say, half of the rooms in our offer.
That’s why we’ve already prepared some cheaper last-minute Christmas stays,” Ingtours director Petr Schiefert said.
The Vrchlabí tourism agency can also offer New Year in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e, but there are fewer vacancies.
The first fourteen days of February leave just as well, the remaining winter stays are sold on average.
This year, the interest in winter stays was negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e.
People are waiting for her to fall.
No one wants to spend the winter in the mountains without snow.
If the tracks are covered during the week, Christmas will also be complete,” says Schiefert.
Conversely, the occupancy of Hotel Horizont in Pec pod Sn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>kou is slightly higher than last year.
We have an improvement of about 5%.
We have a few more places for the New Year as well as for Christmas.
There is a great interest during the January holidays of the Polish people and February also sells well," said Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
The Hotel Omnia near the central parking of Jánské Lázn<0xC4><0x9B> is also complete at eighty percent during the New Year period.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain empty at Christmas in Jánské Lázn<0xC4><0x9B>’s most recent hotel.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we already have sixty percent of occupancy at the moment.
February is a bit weaker for the moment but as soon as the snow is going to fall, the interest for stays in the Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e will certainly continue to grow, said Hotel Omnia director Erik Sporysch.
However, hoteliers in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e should not expect more snow.
Thursday it will be cooler and if there is rain, they should be snowy in the mountains.
But later, the weather is expected to warm up, reports Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Jakubsk<0xC3><0xBD> from the Hradec station of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
U.S.: Rehearsal is the Mother of Wisdom
It even becomes comedic, the assidue effort with which Barack Obama, the wisely-reputed president, reproduces his predecessor’s strategy on the Afghan issue, which he considered himself to be quite simple.
When he ended up letting his so eagerly awaited doctrine sweat, it turned out that he had collected it on carbon paper since Bush’s Iraqi scenario three years ago.
Not content to use in the text even several times the phrase "as in Iraq", he did not hesitate, which is more, to use the title of Bush's January 2007 speech as the title of his own speech: "A new road ahead"
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush’s idea of sending new reinforcements into an Iraq consumed by the civil war as being “irresponsible and a catastrophic decision in its consequences.”
However, the following months showed that Bush’s strategy, which was based on recommendations from campaign commanders, was the only one that was possible and likely to succeed to such an extent that the current newspapers do not speak at all of Iraq.
This did not improve Bush’s reputation, he said, objectively speaking, he left his successor a much more favorable final situation than one could expect.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle will repeat itself
It was once again the campaign commanders who asked him for an increase in the military contingent, including the commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even severely criticized the White House’s reluctance despite the habits of subordination.
He asked 40,000 men to make the situation more favorable.
The president hesitated for three months but in the absence of a better option, he at least scammed the general of 10,000 soldiers.
It has succeeded in removing the promise of an additional 5,000 from Europe, even though it was originally 10,000.
What brings the most problems in Obama's entire strategy seems to be his intention to withdraw the armies of Afghanistan within 18 months and to complete this whole process within three years. The whole of Obama's doctrine brings more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that an increase of half will bear the same fruit as the progress in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders honor the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is marked by the exact opposite - no one can count on and no treaty is respected.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, accustomed to changing their day-to-day leadership according to their arrangement.
Political institutions, although officially founded, will only remain the dust in the eyes behind which patriarchal ethnic relations will proliferate.
It is uniquely complex to balance the interests of the various ethnic groups, given the lack of clarity in relation to the reports, which are still complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "state prompt to act", which is the basic purpose of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The time horizon of Obama’s strategy makes it perplexing by his volunteerism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is currently on the brink of chaos.
Only a purely romantic and out-of-reality heart can be convinced that the little soldiers sent into the turmoil of the war with a view to their "immediate return home" will bring there a real miracle.
From a political point of view, setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible since the Taliban will see it as the indirect sign of American defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that Europeans’ willingness to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is facing the negative.
European politicians do not know or want to explain to their voters what security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the mountains of the Hindu Kush.
Another factor capable of radically altering the situation is the evolution of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, the Americans will face the very difficult issue of solving the problem through military force.
For example, it will be necessary to respond at a time when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of Afghan troops.
However, each solution of this type will result in a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only shame for Obama is the fact that there are three years left until the presidential election and therefore there is still enough time for him to board a new strategy, in case it turns out to be a total fiasco.
Goldman Sachs Bank Managers Will No longer Receive Cash Bonuses
U.S. bank Goldman Sachs senior executives will no longer receive cash premiums this year.
The company announced it was responding to strong criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 major executives will receive shares instead of money, which they will not be able to resell until five years.
Actions can be withdrawn from leaders in case they take too much risk.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is at the forefront of the effort to link salaries with long-term performance at Wall Street.
I suppose Wall Street is well aware of the overall meaning to take, said former investment banker Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan.
The concern lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs has become the target of criticism after setting aside nearly <0x24>17 billion for premiums in the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of premiums will likely exceed <0x24>20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
With the advent of the financial crisis, the high premiums in the banking sector have become a sensitive political issue in many countries.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it would affect a single 50 percent tax on bankers’ bonuses exceeding 25,000 pounds.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year women have won Nobel Prizes in all fields except physics.
These are five women, a record number, who received today in Stockholm the Nobel Prizes in technical disciplines and literature from the hands of King Charles XVI Gustave of Sweden.
In addition to the four scientists there was also the German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, have been awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine with their compatriot Jack Szostak for their research on chromosomes.
The Chemistry Prize was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonathan with Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for illuminating the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last laureate received the Nobel Prize in Economics, the American Elinor Ostrom with her compatriot Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that did not win this year was physics.
This award was awarded today to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibers and George Smith with Willird Boyle for their invention of CCD chips, which are currently the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical glasses.
Each winner has received the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of acquisition of the cash prize.
It reaches 10 million Swedish krona in each category. (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.1 million)
If one of them has multiple winners, they will share the reward among them.
The long-awaited Nobel Peace Prize was handed over this afternoon to US President Barack Obama in Oslo, Norway.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversial nature of his reward as it is only at the beginning of his journey and is also at the head of a country engaged in two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
At the discharge of his policy, he added that in some situations war is essential to achieving peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota plans to resign. Klaus invited him to the Château
President Václav Klaus will receive Friday morning Finance Minister Eduard Janota, who will postpone his stay in the government due to his disagreement with the state budget for next year as voted by the House of Deputies.
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps also the position of Janota in the office will be on the agenda of their Friday meeting.
Klaus also criticized the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which deepens the public finance crisis.
It was Presidential spokesman Radim Ochvat who informed the meeting.
Janota then wants to discuss his position on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the legislation on the budget that will be subject to Klaus's signature, it is a deficit of 163 billion kroner that the Czech Republic should manage.
However, the House of Representatives on Wednesday validated proposals from the left on money transfers and increased salaries for officials, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed the proposals of the Social Democrats for indirectly increasing the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement arose between the left on the one hand, the government, Klaus, and the right on the other, which questioned the future of Fischer’s cabinet, which had been formed by agreement between the ODS, the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and the Green Party.
Critics claim that the budget, as voted by MEPs, removes the savings package passed by the Fischer government and which he believes must end the state's debt.
Klaus, who can ratify the state budget law but does not force it, said today at a breakfast of discussions with entrepreneurs that policies have long neglected the "serious problem" of the "unspeakable deficit" of public finances.
Now, he says, there is no favourable solution.
Only a strong government could make an improvement, if it could rely on a broader consensus of political parties, according to the president.
ODS President Mirek Topolánek said the budget is scary and that the government should question its future existence.
ODS Vice President Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as told the <0xC4><0x8C>TK that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, the ODS and the Greens obviously no longer works.
In his reaction, Prime Minister Fischer called such words "drastic verdicts".
<0xC4><0x8C>SSD head Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Paroubek reacted to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former Topolánek government is scary and that it will exceed 200 billion crowns.
Already on Wednesday, the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD successfully called the ratification of the state budget for next year.
The People's Party was also pleased.
Morgan Freeman Will Play Mandela in Clint Eastwood’s New Movie
Despite criticism that the main roles are played by American actors, South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus - Invaincu will expose the world many things about the country, its fights and its victories.
The story is about sports, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, an Oscar-winning American actor, portrays the film on the life of Nelson Mandela, tirelessly fighting the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and first black president.
Freeman said it was a nineteen-year-old Mandela who asked him to embody it in the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I said, "If I have to incarnate you, I should be able to see you personally.
The sixty-two-year-old actor who was awarded a prize for his role in Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby drama in the middle of boxing has, for example, incarnated the leader of a movement against slavery, becoming the slave himself, but one of the most important presidents ever in the same movie, as the American filmmaker.
The former South African statesman has been imprisoned for 27 years for his hard work to end apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning invincible and is the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the true story of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and the captain of the South African rugby team François to unite the country. President-elect Mandela knows that his country remains still racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He is convinced to be able to unite his people through sport and decides to unite rugby players who are among the outsiders in the world.
The South African team will eventually make progress in the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for a few years to bring Mandela’s story to the big screen.
“I had no other purpose but to play this role in a way that brings it closer to reality,” Freeman said.
The biggest challenge for me was to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the international politician were in the same area, he would have tried to meet Mandela, to dine with him, to be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to hold his hand.
I realized that when I tighten your hand, I recover your energy, it is transmitted and I had the impression of knowing how you feel, he said.
It’s important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there are a majority of white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the tough middle of rugby.
For him, his first encounter with Pienaar at his home was a big surprise.
I remember when I knocked on the door of the house, he opened me up and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was, 'I look much bigger in the movie.'
Despite the differences between actors and real models, Invictus under the direction of director Eastwood received positive reviews and ambitions for the Oscars are even mentioned.
The film critic Todd McCarthy of the Daily Variety summarized his appreciation in these words: "It's a very good story, a very well made film."
In movie reviews on rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent of positive reviews.
The mystery of the aura in Norway is solved: the Russians tested a rocket
A strange luminous phenomenon of unknown origin has been observed above Norway.
The Russian Defense Ministry acknowledged only yesterday that it had tested an intercontinental ballistic missile not far from the Norwegian borders.
The launch, however, was still a failure and the "Bulava" type missile that was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army gradually becomes the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Its repeated presence in missile tests did not have the expected effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava did not fly, or she was damaged in full flight.
Russian newspapers talk about “Bulava” as “missile that does not fly”
A missile that does not fly but shines
The 13th test was done at the beginning normally.
It was only at the end of the flight that there was damage to the aircraft again.
Apparently it was the third-floor engine of the rocket that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" flew from the nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donsky, which was sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can precisely be fired from a moving and submerged ship
That's why the mysterious light above Norway caused by an unidentified flying object was probably caused by a defective "Bulava".
The Norwegians did not doubt for a moment that it was a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time, we can’t talk about failure at all.
The first two stages of the rocket resisted and the avarice hit only the third.
In the previous cases, the engines had flaws on the first floor.
Even though none of the trial launches were without hooks, the Department of Defense’s management considers that only six out of thirteen were failures.
This success rate of almost fifty percent therefore fills the generals with optimism and they always say that one day "Bulava" will fly smoothly and that it will carry even ten hypersonic nuclear nuclei with a total weight of 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetissov signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow at age 51
The legendary defender Viatcheslav Fetissov will appear again in a professional game at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and holder of the Stanley Cup will lend his team to CSKA Moscow in need and will probably make his entry already during Friday's game against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who ended his career at the age of forty in 1998, is currently the president of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuliash's injury, we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov trains regularly and agrees to help the team.
We still need to settle some details about the form, says club coach Sergey Nyemtchinov, quoted by the AP agency.
It has not been specified whether the legendary hockey player's comeback will concern only one match.
I think Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the minds of other players, Nyemtchinov said.
According to AP, in the case of his return on the ice, Fetissov thus becomes the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In the NHL, legendary striker Gordie Howe played a season for Hartford and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous Quintet Fetisov, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best hockey players and among those with the most success.
Under the colours of the Soviet Union he won twice gold at the Olympics, seven world champion titles, he won the Canada Cup as well as the junior world championship.
In the second part of his career, he also garnered tributes in the NHL where he held the Stanley Cup twice.
He has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 2001.
Hyundai listens to trade unions and cancels all overtime
The management of the Hyundai plant in No<0xC5><0xA1>ovice agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It was precisely because of the frequent overtime that unions declared a state of emergency strike on Monday.
The spokesman for the Hyundai plant, Petr Van<0xC4><0x9B>k, has confirmed it.
The management, however, still wants to agree with the unions on a Saturday working again this year.
We can’t give up our production plan, it’s essential, which is why additional volunteer hours were offered on Saturday 19 December knowing that there would be two teams, Vanek said.
The website Sedmi<0xC4><0x8D>ka.cz said the company offered a bonus of 400 Czech crowns to employees who would be part of the team on Saturday.
It will also be awarded a posteriori for the working day on 28 November.
The company, according to Van<0xC4><0x9B>k, has decided to change the way to motivate its employees in exchange for extra hours.
Either they receive the supplement for the extra hours, or they can post a replacement leave on December 28 and thus extend their holidays indicated by Van<0xC4><0x9B>k.
In addition, all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for the transportation costs and for their lunch.
Given that overtime was the most urgent and hottest point in trade union comments and claims as employees who spontaneously stopped production last week, the management made the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for the month of December, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
Until last week, employees at the automotive factory were forced to work almost daily two extra hours in addition to their eight hours.
Trade unions plan to cancel the state of strike after signing the agreement.
The next negotiation between the automotive factory management and the unions is due to take place on Friday afternoon.
Trade union leader Petr Kucha<0xC5><0x99> said on Wednesday that they were ready to end the state of strike if they agreed on their claims and signed a joint document.
The situation at the plant peaked last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees spontaneously went on strike due to uninterrupted overtime.
They also protested against poor wage conditions and alleged bribery.
The management defended itself with the fact that employees had to work in addition to meet the car production requirements.
In the announcement of the strike on Monday, the unions also demanded that employees who have stopped production be subjected to no sanctions.
Trade unions ask the company to reduce the time spent in overtime to a minimum.
In addition, they want this year a remuneration of 5,000 crowns (about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>209) for these.
The Hyundai car factory in No<0xC5><0xA1>ovice currently employs 2,000 people.
It started mass production last year in November.
It manufactured about 80,000 vehicles by September of this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works on "persistent" HIV viruses also
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new combinations that can slow the spread of the HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of the enhanced substance is that it also acts on viruses that have already developed immunity to drugs.
This reality, in some cases, takes over the fact that the combination does not act as intensely on the common variants of the virus as well as some drugs already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at this time.
However, it is possible to radically extend the life of patients through a mixture of drugs that prevent the spread of the HIV virus in the body.
However, their consumption has a number of side effects.
In addition, the suppression of this multiplication results in the development of so-called resistant viruses on which drugs no longer have an effect.
The work of experts from three institutions, the Czech Academy of Sciences, the V<0xC5><0xA0>CHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way for a way to cope with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called metalocarbons act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
Metalocarbons are an assembly of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way than all the drugs used so far and that’s why they could overcome the resistance problem.
The researchers’ work leads them to discover new “enhanced” substances, based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their bindings to the virus proteins.
The metallocarbons have a single three-dimensional structure: two cages with multiple walls are formed by bore, hydrogen and carbon atoms and connected by a metal atom, in this case the cobalt.
A traitorous and resistant virus.
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential to the virus's life cycle.
Without the division of the HIV virus caused by HIV protease, there would be no birth of mature infectious particles of the virus.
If HIV protease is stopped, the spread of the virus will also be stopped in the patient’s body, the researchers explained in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their paper published in the Journal of Medical Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified.
A little weaker but more reliable.
The efficacy of this series of substances on HIV proteases was tested in test tubes as well as on its resistant variants, obtained from HIV-contaminated patients.
On the common version of the enzyme, the effect of metalocarbons is not as strong as on clinical drugs, however, it does not weaken on the resistant versions against which the common drugs are often ineffective.
Metalocarbons, with their unique mechanism of action and other properties such as their biological and chemical stability, their low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications are therefore interesting combinations to examine more in order to be directed towards the development of effective drugs against HIV, the bioenergy of the biotechnology, the biotechnology of the laboratory, says Pavlína <0xC5><0x98>ri<0xC4><0x87>a.
The ODS addresses this issue to Fischer, who defends himself
The president of the ODS (Democratic Civic Party), Mirek Topolánek, has described the ratified budget for the following year as “awesome” and according to him, the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should question its existence.
The Prime Minister called the statements of the ODS a drastic verdict.
He says it takes time to analyze.
ODS spokesman Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as said that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, the ODS and the Green Party was obviously no longer working.
According to Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as, the head of government should decide whether the House of Representatives supports the minority concerned with fighting the growing deficit, or whether it is concerned to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as warned that ODS and social democrats’ positions on the issue of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The House of Representatives on Wednesday ratified the budget for 2010, with proposals for amendments amounting to 12 billion crowns included by the left.
The House increased the money for the salaries of officials, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government’s grievance against the Social Democrats’ proposals was that they indirectly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to manage a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS left the room before the vote, thus obeying the wishes of the government as what a modified budget is a less bad variant than an interim budget.
Disappointment and uselessness
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of futility, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said the government will still reflect on the current situation.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as is convinced that if Janota threatened to resign in the event of the ratification of the amendments, the situation could be different.
According to Czech Television, Janota made an appointment with the Prime Minister on Monday after his transition to the government:
At the same time, he said that he was wondering if he would remain in his position.
His disappointment in the negotiations around the budget is the reason for this.
If Fischer decides to continue to fight the budget deficit, Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as believes that the representatives of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, who imposed the budget changes, have no place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also say clearly that he will resign if the House ratifies other deficit-increasing laws such as those concerning health insurance, pensions, or the reform of the Services Act.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed by the ODS are not in question.
This is the case of the head of the Fischer government and the whole government.
Ministers appointed by the ODS have done nothing detrimental, Topolánek said in a text message from the United States.
He recalled that the deputy ministers of some ministries are claiming TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as stressed that if Fischer decides to resign in the face of a fight against the amount of the public finance deficit, "it is quite logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing majority that is currently in the House."
That said, he should not expect the support and tolerance of the Democrats.
I didn’t think about it and once it’s on the agenda then I’ll dedicate myself to it,” said Defence Minister Martin Barták, elected to the government by the Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer flew in the afternoon for a debate at the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS retreated at the request of the Prime Minister.
At the same time, Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as stressed that the ODS would probably have voted against the amended budget on Wednesday if it had not explicitly asked Democrats to allow the budget to vote.
We don't feel like orphans, we don't have small children, he responded to the question of whether the ODS had not been blamed by the Party president in the House or in the country during the budget negotiations.
I did not notice that my vote would have failed.
I already knew at the time I resigned from my mandate that what would follow in the following months would be a bolchevization of the House and the destruction of everything that was positive, Topolánek responded in person.
According to the new schedules of the <0xC4><0x8C>D, there will be fewer trains for identical rates.
The Czech Railways will remove or limit from 13 December some less-charged express or regional trains and will reinforce some others.
The total coverage of transport will decrease by 2% on the day of entry into force of the new schedules compared to today.
Most fares will not change, including basic fares and reduced fares.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava region will have more connections to the capital, the Railways will add a pendulum copper.
On the contrary, an express will stop serving Bratislava.
There will also be fewer high-speed trains on the Prague - Písek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice line, the direct line Prague - Letohrad will be radically reduced.
At the regional level, the largest decrease in transport affects the Hradec Králové region of eight per cent in total, while Prague and its surroundings can enjoy an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice line are also cancelled and the circulation of a few express trains on the Prague - Písek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice line will be reduced to just a few days a week.
One of the biggest transformations is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague: for now, the inhabitants of Milovice must change to Lysá nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the Esko suburban system, the opening of which is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
Distances to the capital will have their final destination at Prague main station (Prague Hlavní nádra<0xC5><0xBE>í).
<0xC4><0x8C>D will introduce more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and trains to <0xC5><0xA0>umperk/Jeseník will depart at intervals of two hours.
Travellers will no longer be able to take the Pendolino to Bratislava from December 13.
The invoice this year for regional railways: 200 million additional crowns.
The express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport and will pay to the Railways next year in a total of four billion crowns to settle the visible losses, the same amount as this year. Regional trains are ordered by the regions that will pay for them by a total of eight billion in the next year.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The Railways have recently signed a ten-year contract, so far the duration was still one year.
The railways appreciate the system, which also explains that they did not resort to a price increase of the vast majority of transport securities.
Changes will only affect one-day <0xC4><0x8C>D Net tickets and reduced eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka internet tickets.
For travelers without a discount card, the price of <0xC4><0x8C>D Net will increase from 450 to 600 crowns.
The price of eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka will again depend on the route it took, while so far it was valid between cities of a region of the choice and was at a single price of 160 CZK.
Filipino rebels still detain more than 50 people, children released
Rebels have kidnapped 75 people in the southern Philippines, including a few primary school students and their teachers.
It was the AFP agency that informed, but it only spoke about 65 hostages.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, as well as one of the teachers.
Hostage took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
It is reported that about 19 rebels used the hostages as human shields while fleeing to the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to find an agreement for the release of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the rebels belong to the New People’s Army (NPA), which is the armed branch of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AFP, police first prosecuted the kidnappers after violence caused during a settlement of accounts between two family clans.
The martial law was declared in the southern province of Maguindanao due to a recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre linked to the governor’s administration election were 30 journalists.
The governor of this southern Philippine province was arrested on suspicion of involvement in the massacre, as well as his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan lineage.
The island of Mindanao also includes active Muslim separatists.
However, they resumed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The history of South Africa concerns everyone, according to Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
Clint Eastwood's new Hollywood film arrives in the US rooms in the coming days, the title is Invictus (the official Czech title is Invictus: Nepora<0xC5><0xBE>en<0xC3><0xBD>), and narrates a part of the life of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-renowned apartheid fighter came back to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to incarnate him.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion was attributed to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in the rooms, the feedback of critics and the public is heard.
Nelson Mandela
Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on June 18, 1918 in Mvezu, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sakharov Prize for his freedom of mind, and in 1993 he later received the Nobel Peace Prize alongside Klerk.
He served as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great hopes as it is presented at a time when, on the one hand, South Africa is fully preparing for the World Cup, and on the other hand, because the media is agitated by worrying news about the increase in racial conflicts and the non-discrimination of the major population.
According to the AP, the reactions to the new film are currently quite positive in South Africa, despite frequent reservations about the main roles where Hollywood stars "pawn".
Morgan Freeman, however, is proud of the film in his own words.
I've dreamed of this role for many years and I've been well prepared.
I have also met Nelson Mandela several times in person to be able – as they say – to regain his energy, he said at the film’s first official film in Los Angeles.
I think it’s a good thing if you have the opportunity to remember through the film Mandela’s personality and message.
This is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but it concerns each individual, he added.
Wearing the national rugby team shirt
The film is based on the story of the novel by British writer John Carlin, the title being freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the piece that gave its creation to the people portrays the South African human rights defender during his tenure as president.
Morgan Freeman attempts to collect two racial groups from a long-divised population and, like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he dressed in the South African team's national shirt on the grass at the World Cup, which South Africa had won at the time.
To showcase on the shirt lawn, which is considered something sacred in South Africa, Mandela had long been ovationed fourteen years ago mainly from the white public and was recognized by the white population.
Let’s hope that the football championship will succeed in bringing people back into one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only “black” of the national team in 1995.
It remains to be seen whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve.
The South African whites, however, are skeptical as he recently confided in an interview with LN Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled to Britain.
The championship began on June 11, 2010.
A transformer worth tens of millions of crowns in flames in the Louny region
A fire engulfed a <0xC4><0x8C>eps company transformer from the distribution centre near the municipality of Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kov in Lounsk in the morning.
According to Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Marvan, a spokesman for the <0xC3><0x9A>stí fire department, there are six units operating on the fire.
They originally intended to allow the transformer to be consumed, but they revised their opinion and extinguished the fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special substance.
The cause is a technical defect, an internal short circuit of the transformer.
No one was injured and according to company spokeswoman Pavla Mandatova, the incident did not jeopardize the safe operation of the entire transmission.
Damage is estimated at a few tens of millions of crowns, the exact figure may be known once the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandatova, the destroyed transformer will have to be replaced by a new one.
She adds that in ten years of activity, the company <0xC4><0x8C>eps has not known anything similar and that incidents of this type are isolated.
The power supply has not been interrupted, says <0xC4><0x8C>EZ spokeswoman for the North Bohemian So<0xC5><0x88>a Holingerova Hendrychova, the operation of homes, administrations and industries has not been influenced by the fire of the transforming station.
A.s. <0xC4><0x8C>eps is the exclusive operator of 400 kV and 220 kV power lines in the Czech Republic.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 distribution stations with 67 transformers transferring electricity from the transport units to the distribution units and line tracks with a length of 4,339 kilometers.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura will file a complaint for defamation against three prefects of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD
Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, owner of Student Agency, will file a complaint today for defamation against three Social Democratic prefects.
And specifically against Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek of the South Moravia region, against Radko Martínka of the Pardubice region and against the Prefect of the Olomouc region Martin Tesa<0xC5><0x99>ík.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura indicated it in Twenty Minutes of Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál.
The complaint relates to the company's attempt to exploit regional railways in certain regions.
However, all regions ended up signing long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three of us attacked and claimed that the fine mouths were made, while we only made an offer for what they wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways which is not true because we know the prices of the Czech Railways that were signed last week.
So we have nothing but to defend ourselves.
It is in exchange for slanders on the company Student Agency, Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál.
Similarly, he said he had evidence that no region has proceeded in accordance with European law.
We are preparing a complaint to the European Commission for this.
Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek considers that Mr. Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura’s complaint is the follow-up to his media show, which serves as a free advertisement for his company and for his person.
I am of course willing to defend my name and the name of my region and I call on the other prefects to do the same.
I suppose this will be an opportunity to show clearly that it is Mr Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura who manipulates public opinion and uses false and false arguments on regional rail transport, says Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura has already announced last week that it will invest a few million crowns in an advertisement that will mention the unfavorable actions of the regions.
He told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál that he stopped the campaign after Christmas and plans to resume it after the New Year.
He said the campaign will target corruption in the broader sense.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura began his campaign after the regions agreed to entrust the Czech Railways with the operation of the railway connections for an order of about 150 billion kroner, without issuing tenders.
According to Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, such an action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions even brought to Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura threats from a member of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He appeared as a member of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, I do not know who he is, but I will not say his name, Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál today.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
Pneumococcal vaccination will revert old habits as of January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
There are already voices, saying that compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against peak pneumococcus.
The Pharmaceutical Institute already defines for vaccines the maximum prices that health insurance will pay.
Specialists also see clearly in the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for children of August.
Since January, children born last year from 2 August can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcus.
The condition is that they have not been vaccinated yet.
If you started vaccination last year or earlier, you will have to pay for the following vaccinations yourself.
The first dose of the vaccine should be administered between the 3rd and 5th month of the child.
Last year, a quarter of families have voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococcus.
However, parents paid 1,600 crowns or even more for a dose.
Vaccination of the youngest requires four doses.
Experts estimate that every year health insurance spends 300 to 450,000 crowns on vaccine doses.
However, they save on the medical care that unvaccinated children would need.
To date, the state spent about 500,000 crowns a year on all children’s vaccinations.
The refunded vaccination was introduced with the "Janota package".
Pneumococcals are the cause of inflammation of the middle ear but also of serious infections including inflammation of the meninges and blood poisoning.
According to hospital surveys, up to 28 children under the age of 10 died from pneumococcal infections.
Apart from the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries have introduced refunded vaccination.
Is vaccination mandatory?
There are opinions on a possible future vaccination obligation.
Starting in January, it must be covered by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of the Nahlas association Rudolf Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD> indicated that compulsory vaccination would be more positive.
His association has long been promoting pneumococcal vaccination.
At an international conference at which our association participated, the specialists were not really satisfied that we had an optional vaccination.
It's not perfect.
On the other hand, we are happy to have been able to impose at least this.
I think this is a direction we need to follow now," Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD> said.
But the Ministry of Health does not want to change the pneumococcal vaccination process.
We are not considering it at all for the moment, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88>.
Optional vaccination has its drawbacks, doctors say.
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Paediatric Society, acknowledges that a vaccination based on volunteerism is flawed.
If all children were vaccinated, a reduction in vaccination renewals could be considered “In the situation where the vaccine costs such a sum I understand the decision making vaccination optional,” Cabrnochová says.
Experts predict that by next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will have their babies vaccinated.
Pneumococcal vaccination also marks a break because it is the first vaccination of children that is funded by insurance and not the state.
Cabrnochová explains that insurance should release funds for prevention, thereby saving on possible future medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their own products.
However, this is related to the concerns of pediatric practitioners, who are concerned with the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to buy the vaccines by insurance, the doctors receiving them in the same way as other vaccine products provided by the state.
However, some MEPs feared that this would allow insurance companies to "deduct the amounts of health insurance."
Thus, doctors will have to buy the products and wait for insurance to pay them back.
According to estimates, pediatricians will have to individually invest nearly 40,000 crowns per month in vaccines, which is an important sum.
It will be far from easy, according to Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in a "Museum Flight"
Frank Frazetta’s son, a recognized illustrator, was accused of attempting to steal paintings worth <0x24>20 million (<0xC2><0xA3>12 million) in his father’s museum.
In Pennsylvania, police said Alfonso Frank Frazetta had been arrested while loading 90 paintings in his vehicle and in a trailer.
According to her, Mr. Frazetta and another man used a mechanical shell to force the entrance to the museum, in the Pocono Mountains region.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, 81, is famous for his drawings of characters such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, the Associated Press (AP) news agency reported.
AP quoted a police official as saying that the young Mr. Frazetta may have been motivated by a family dispute.
According to a police statement, Mr. Frazetta Jr, 52, claims to have been allowed by his father to “enter the museum, by any means, to transport the paintings into a storage facility,” the agency reported.
Mr. Frazetta Senior denied having given such an authorization, the agency said.
Labour advocates an increase in the budgetary tax.
Ministers have defended the increase in taxes and the cuts in spending announced in the pre-budget report, despite criticism from the opposition, companies and unions.
The Tories claimed that Alistair Darling "lacked" an opportunity to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by postponing his decisions until after the election.
The Chancellor also attracted the scoundrels by attacking low and middle wages.
Among its main proposals are a 0.5% increase in Social Security and a 1% ceiling on public wages from 2011 onwards.
The Anger of Social Security
The unions protested that low wages are penalized by a recession of which they are not responsible and warned that “problems” were being announced.
The decline in social insurance - which will bring about <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion a year - has angered the world of businesses because, according to him, it is a job tax while the goal should be a relaunch of the economy.
The increase, reserved for those who earn more than <0xC2><0xA3>20,000 a year, will affect about 10 million workers.
PRINCIPLES OF THE PRE-BUDGET REPORT
Social Security will increase again by 0.5% from April 2011
The economy will fall even more than 4.75% expected this year
New 50% tax on bankers bonuses
Increased corporate income tax for small companies has been abandoned
E-cars and wind turbines tax discounts
Increase in pensions by 2.5%
According to Treasury estimates, a person who wins <0xC2><0xA3>30,000 will lose <0xC2><0xA3>90 per year and a person who wins <0xC2><0xA3>40,000 will lose <0xC2><0xA3>190, while a person who wins <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 per year will gain <0xC2><0xA3>110 extra.
The ministers said their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 led to "difficult decisions", but insisted that 60% of the additional tax burden would be on the top 5% of employees.
Stephen Timms, the Treasury Secretary, refuted an increase in the tax and stressed that a decrease in spending was a "goat of water in the ocean" compared to what was needed.
"These figures are important, and they will allow us to divide the deficit by two, which will be absolutely essential in the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he was confident and that the economic growth would resume at the end of the year.
However, Labour's forecasts of economic growth - which will influence the amount it will have to borrow and the speed at which the deficit will be met - were questioned after the Chancellor was forced to revise his first figures.
In his speech, he said that the economy would likely fall by 4.75% this year – far worse than the 3.5% decline predicted in April – while the loan would be 3 billion GDP higher than the previous estimate.
"Lost Opportunity"
The Conservatives, which will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn of Labour’s “debt crisis,” said the project to borrow <0xC2><0xA3>789 billion over the next six years was not viable.
The ministers failed to present a credible plan on how to reimburse, they added, eluding "cynically" difficult choices until after the election - which is due to take place in June 2010.
"They didn't present anything significant about what they were going to do," said Philip Hammond, Chief Secretary at the Ghost Cabinet Treasury. "They had the opportunity to do it and they missed it."
"The important announcements will be made after the election, regardless of the winner."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from upcoming reductions, as opposed to the Tory proposals that would lead to a faster and more significant reduction in the deficit.
But the Lib Dems claimed that the money raised thanks to the increase in taxes and the decrease in spending would be used to support spending next year and not to reduce the deficit, claiming that the plans were "built on the wind".
Nick Robinson, the BBC’s political editor, stated that the schedule of announcements – such as the increase in inflation for some disability benefits in April next year, mentioned above – would leave the Chancellor facing charges of propaganda, the money being simply recovered the following year.
However, Labour insists that additional assistance is being provided while people need it most and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"False budget"
Although the ministers did not publish the details of spending beyond 2011, economists said it was clear that restrictions on public spending would only begin to be felt in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies has stated that the Chancellor's figures will in the future involve substantial reductions in many areas, including potentially transport, higher education, science and defense.
“The pain is actually just postponed,” said its director, Robert Chote.
“The most important announcements will be made after the election, regardless of the winner,” said Roger Bootle, Deloitte’s Economic Advisor to Accountants.
"This was a false pre-budget report. Markets are well aware of it."
FBI Investigates 'Arrests of Americans in Pakistan'
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five U.S. reporters suspected of extremist links.
The men were arrested during a raid on a house in Sarghada in eastern Punjab province, the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it was investigating whether the same men had been reported missing from their home in the U.S. state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. Department of State said it was also looking for information about these people.
Three of them are of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
If they are American citizens, of course, we would like to know what the charges against them are and under what conditions they are detained,” said spokesman Ian Kelly.
Katherine Schwait, an FBI spokeswoman, said the agency had been aware of the arrests and that she was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their activities there, and if it really is the students who are being carried away," she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men had been arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of them.
She said the house had already been monitored by local police and that no charges had yet been brought against the arrested men.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined any comments on the arrests, Reuters reported, but said the United States should “cooperate more with Afghanistan and Pakistan in an attempt to derail the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to enforce terrorists.”
The five students had been taken missing from their homes by their families in northern Virginia in late November.
Amnesty condemns Iran’s “abuse”
In the past 20 years, human rights have been less respected than ever, according to the Amnesty International report.
The report presents "repetitions of violations" by the regime, before and after the June presidential election campaign.
One man quoted in the report claimed that he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he had been threatened with rape.
Iran has denied previous criticism of its non-respect for human rights.
Authorities have claimed that such criticism is politically motivated.
Thousands of people were arrested and dozens were killed in Iran after the contested election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad led to the largest public demonstrations since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens have been sentenced to prison and prosecutors say at least five people have been sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, a BBC correspondent in Tehran, now in London, claims that at the beginning of the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention center.
But since then, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, our correspondent says.
"False Confession"
Amnesty International reported the case of a 26-year-old computer student, Ebrahim Mehtari, who claimed to have been accused of "working with Facebook networks" and protesting against the election results.
“They often hit me in the face,” he was quoted as saying.
“I was burned with cigarettes, under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... They threatened to execute me and humiliated me.”
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left in the street, still bloody and half-conscious, Amnesty said.
In August, the losing candidate, Mehdi Karroubi, claimed that protesters detained after the election were tortured to death in prison and others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the rape allegations, but admitted that abuses had taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee who said he had been locked in a container with 75 other people, for more than eight weeks, in a detention center in Kahrizak.
Amnesty agreed that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary set up a committee to investigate post-election disturbances and the government's response, but said the mandate and powers of these bodies were unclear and that the results of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people had been arrested over the past three weeks in order to prevent further protests.
Ski slopes built in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow has been used to turn the Bristol site into a race track.
The eventPiste in the Park attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders to compete for cash prizes.
At the top of the Brandon Hill Park track, a small tremplin preceded a 100m long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said the view from the top of the track was magnificent but it was quite intimidating.
It is a magnificent view, with all the lights of the city sparkling downstairs.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country - real talents," he added.
Awards have rewarded the best volts – or figures made on the track.
After Thursday night’s party, the snow will be abandoned to the melt.

Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the author's latest book, "Why French people don't like the scarf" (2006), an elegant and well-documented study of a problem that has divided and concerned the country for fifteen years and the effects of which are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen’s latest book presents a much broader and more ambitious frame.
A good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is currently happening in the country.
He spent many months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide in France what Mr. Bozen calls "Muslim spaces" for the 5m-6m Muslims.
He is very good at listening to and reproducing the discussions between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in the town hall (or both)?
Should the evolution and rights of homosexuals be taught to young Muslims?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use an interest-based banking system to obtain a loan?
It is these practical problems, he says, that are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas that worry the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They don’t push the debate to the end.
Conservatives do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists interviewed by Mr. Bowen are generally in agreement with their counterparts advocates of a purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, which now constitute a small part of Europe’s Muslims.
Mr. Bowen believes that the values of the Muslims and the secularism of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can only be achieved with the efforts of each camp.
He wonders how much the French politicians (and the intellectual elite guarding so virulent secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims were not spoiled, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make historic compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than growing pragmatism, it detects a “strictness of key values.”
After reading this book, one is tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The darkest view in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other place on the planet.
The ice that composes it is melting at an alarming speed, bringing with it a life that cannot survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, expeditions and fishing navigate in new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their tracks.
In "On a thin layer of ice", Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, paints a natural history of the symbol of the Great North, the polar bear.
Knowing the history and complicated policies of whale fishing, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who proved themselves by hunting the white bear.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, then courageous 14-year-old aspirant who had only to fight the tip of his mosque, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young bears, captured while swimming next to their mother, just killed, were caught and sent to zoos and cirques.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a famous show gathered 75 bears at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are still usually one millionth of the surface needed for a free adult. the climate is rarely indicated: a polar bear living in Singapore has become green due to the algae growing in its thick fur.

Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and often refers to the threat that hunters pose to species survival.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, killings continue in Greenland and Canada where helicopter hunters and Inuit Indians use powerful assault rifles to hunt their game.
Ironically, it is in the most northern waters of these two nations that the ice will remain the longest.
In his new book, "After the Ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor-in-chief of New Scientist, offers a clear and frightening overview of the Arctic science and a captivating overview of what the future may be there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric nor oceanographers can accurately relate the speed of change.
It's not wrong to try.
In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Fridtjof Nansen’s pioneering journeys provided the first information on the melting of the ice cap.
The Cold War submarines then mapped the sub-cell relief changes.
Satellite surveillance and probes placed on the icebergs are of great help, but most of the work is done by hardened men, camping in the cold.
Mr. Anderson contemplates the extraordinary and tiny world of the dependency system of Arctic ice, formed by pressed salt water grids by freezing.
But from the above-mentioned bear to the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of summer ice, scheduled between 2013 and 2050.
“In a few months, it might be our turn.”
Marines, among the 6,000 people who deposited crowns on the tombs in Arlington
First-class De'Angelo Robinson, 19, made a seven-hour bus ride to deposit a single crown on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and for the other Marines who made the trip from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina to the Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the tombs, this day was dedicated to greeting men and women who, one day, were in their place.
“In a few months, from where we will be sent, we risk being in their place,” Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If this were to happen to me, I would like someone to do the same for me, which is why I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of the 6,000 volunteers who gathered on Saturday morning to deposit crowns on the tombs of the veterans, in different sections of the Arlington Ceremony Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the commemoration and other people decided to decorate several hundred tombs in the Arlington Ceremony Cemetery.
Now, to continue an 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen travel every year, stopping in different cities on their way, to organize commemorations in honor of the military and the victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America, which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, the volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the tombs of Arlington Cemetery, around the Pentagon, on the tombs of Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in Battery Park in New York City, and on the site of the memorial for the victims of the Flight 93 of Unitedville Airlines, Penyvaks.
For the second consecutive year, the Walmart Foundation has donated more than <0x24>150,000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she had traveled to Arlington in honor of her husband, a deceased career soldier.
Although her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way to thank those who sacrificed themselves.
It is a small gesture that civilians can do to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Emmitted in several layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked between the lawns and the extended hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers chose ancient tombs dating from the First and Second World Wars, as well as the Vietnam War, as these are not as often visited as the new tombs, the organizers said.
The mood was optimistic, while the children were playing and the couples were holding hands, wearing fresh pine crowns on the gray graves.
Each round crown had a dark green color, with a small red butterfly node on top.
Nearby, silence was planned on Section 60, where most of the war veterans in Iraq and Afghanistan are inhumed.
The United Service Organizations gave 1,000 crowns to decorate the section but the dark mood of the current wars filled the area.
People were crying without hiding, others were praying and families and friends were standing in the cold air.
Some read the names engraved in the stone aloud, while others bowed to see the small black and white information cards, pushed into the wetland for those whose grave had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers in tears on her son’s grave.
She was from Zanesfield, Ohio, and had driven eight hours to come gather at the tomb of Marine Sergeant GunneryDavid Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget what we are free thanks to... my son paid for it, she said.
“A long time after I disappeared, I want someone to remember him.”
A U.S. citizen arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. citizen who was distributing mobile phones and laptops in the country, U.S. Department of State services said.
The citizen, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular authorities as well as the U.S. Interest Section in Havana are trying to access the detainee who was arrested on December 5.
The exact allegations have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or foreign visitor may be arrested under the pretext of being "dangerous".
All so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writings, lead to the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, led by Yoani Sánchez, a popular commentator who often writes about how they are married and is being followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive rewards, but his permissions have always been denied.
The detention of a U.S. citizen may increase tensions between the Communist Brotherhood government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which is pursuing a "soft" approach to improving relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday evening.
The new U.S. policy insists that the Cuban government move forward in concrete steps, such as freeing political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, so that the U.S. can do the same.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although it is new and desired consumer goods in a country or the average salary of an official is <0x24>15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for texts or for a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a salary day.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who wish to connect often must communicate their name to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few Americans imprisoned in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, a press office at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are a big mistake.
An activity that, in any other open society, would be allowed -- to distribute mobile phones for free -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas program of the Human Rights Watch group, who recently published a severe report on freedoms in Cuba, called "The New Place of Castro, even in the case of Castro's re-installation of the country."
According to Vivanco, a defendant is often arrested, prosecuted and imprisoned the same day.
He said any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, at a time when the two countries are starting to start a better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities prevent conspiracy to send men to Afghanistan <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities spotted an organization supposed to prepare a plot to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan in order to kill American troops, saying they hoped that this case would dismantle an important network of recruiters of terrorists who document Internet raped young men in search of the Internet.
Investigators claimed they were chasing a hidden insurgent personality, known as Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after discovering them when one of them made comments endorsing the terrorist waves on the YouTube video site on the Internet.
Arriving in Pakistan, these men were guided by Saifullah, who tried to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan’s tribal belt, the home of al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who was informed on Saturday said Saifullah had failed to convince al-Qaeda commanders that these men were not involved in the CIA’s plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they have been isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the forbidden mountains of the northeast, which have become a refuge for terrorism.
They were seen as infiltrated agents.
That is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who expressed condition of anonymity due to the confidentiality of the case.
The representative of the authorities claimed that the men were determined and were still trying to obtain the necessary permissions to enter the al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and are being interrogated by the FBI -- insists on the crucial role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and perhaps more importantly, in determining who to trust.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the U.S. intelligence services have been prioritizing the infiltration of men into the al-Qaeda network.
The organization's recruiters play the role of barrier guards, refusing entry to those who do not show serious commitment and those who may prove to be spies.
According to analysts, potential U.S. recruits are closely studied by al-Qaeda.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to US targets and their propaganda value.
However, Evan Kohlmann, an expert from the US-based NEFA Foundation, said that terrorist groups must also pay more and more attention in recent years in the choice of people they accept as U.S. intelligence services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you’re trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way to follow their recruitment model than so many other people have already followed?” said Kohlmann.
The model is the one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of Protesters in Copenhagen Call for Climate Action
Tens of thousands of protesters marched in the streets here on Saturday, calling for greater climate action from negotiators working in the city’s Bella Convention Center.
The number of protesters was estimated to be 100,000, but the police estimates to be 25,000.
The event took place relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists lit a few explosives near a set of government buildings in the city centre.
On this day when nothing happened during UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists marched around the city, deploying English-language posters saying "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish, declaring "Earth says it has enough."
Several celebrities joined the protests, including top Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said traveling to her mother’s home country, Peru, opened her eyes to the devastating problems that the country is facing due to the impact of climate change already taking place.”
That's one of the reasons I decided to join the big march -- to give the floor and to call on leaders around the world to make fair, ambitious and committed decisions," she said.
This is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
Police prevented protesters from getting too close to Bella and said they had arrested 19 people for wearing a mask or holding pocket knives.
Police prevented protesters from getting too close to Bella and said they had arrested 19 people for wearing a mask or holding pocket knives.
According to a passerby who asked to remain anonymous because of his involvement in climate talks, activists wearing black masks and clothing lighted several explosives near the main Copenhagen canal that is surrounded by a few ministries.
They were launching them near the buildings, he said, adding that they were first rockets, followed by "some major explosions".
Inside the Palais des Congrès, people were gathered around television screens to follow the walk, throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that the protesters have failed to awaken the awareness of key authorities such as Su Wei, China’s climate representative.
When asked if he thought a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, "In fact, it's something I wasn't aware of.
He then continued in Mandarin, declaring "Since the event is important, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He noted that walking may seem harmful or useful depending on the perspective.
It shows the interest of the general public and different sectors on the topic of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, “you can also say that they disrupt negotiations or that they harm the freedom of others.”
Test Results Reveal Tense Differences Between Races
Last week's federal report on mathematics results brought good news for Washington D.C. public schools.
Although the District is still far behind the head offices, the report shows that Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) have made much greater progress in the previous two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what emerges from the latest figures in the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent discrepancy between African-Americans and whites, both locally and nationally.
The average scores of Grade 4 (cm1) white children in Washington D.C. in the last two years have increased from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their African-American classmates have only increased by three points, from 209 to 212.
The success gap actually increased between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African Americans in Grade 8 (4th) remains generally constant, falling only by one point, from 245 to 244.
The average white result was not included in the test results because the sample was not sufficiently important.
The overview over a six-year period is no longer encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in Grade 4 (cm1) class, when the District's first NAEP report was published, was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results obtained by children in both groups increased during this period, the difference was only reduced to 58 points.
Last week, some advocates in the District expressed concern that the rise celebrated by school group director Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were driven by white students who were already good elements.
This would mean that we raised the aggregate by considering the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and annoying, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that advocates equality in District education.
“I don’t jump with joy for one or two points,” Kwame R. Brown, a D.C. board member whose daughter is in Grade 4, told Eaton Elementary.
Often critical of Rhee’s management style, Brown stated that the message of the test results is that the city’s middle schools desperately need attention.
Really, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect them.
But what is frightening is that we don’t devote enough time and energy to our middle schools.
Rhee said the District should continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This autumn, for example, some teachers have been trained to use a new reading method, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at schoolchildren in elementary and early school end classes who have not incorporated the basics of reading earlier in their school courses and who are quite related to their courses.
Every day, the mathematics program, for kindergarten classes at Grade 6 (6th) focuses on real-life games and experiences, as they were put in place in the District by former manager Clifford Janey, who must also be credited for the latest NAEP progress report.
I just think we need to keep working to offer better interventions to these students at a lower level than the class,” Rhee said.
Others believe that the results of NAEP raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise the overall results of the system while providing money and resources for schools with less good results to reduce the gap.
This is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a teaching trainer at the University of Berkeley, California, who is studying the results of the city tests.
The conventional political solution is to devote your resources and management reforms to schools located in the poorest neighborhoods of Washington.
This targeting can also have political repercussions that interfere with this important programme.
But the problem, of course, is that like the other Superintendent of Schools, she tries to use the middle class of whites and blacks.
We focus on ensuring the development of a system of good schools.
We need to strengthen our neighbourhood schools so that all families, wherever they come from, can be assured that their children will be able to receive excellent public education.
Janey, now the Superintendent of Newark Schools, said in an interview this week that one of the key elements to reducing the gap in success was the length of the traditional public school, now 180 days in the Washington District, to compete with the Charter Schools.
It takes about 200 days to have the strength to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with his teachers' union last year to get 185 days, that he considers a "start point" to get another increase in the upcoming contract.
Making Higher Education a Promise of the Future
The bus stopped at Gettysburg College with a long sigh.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, descends and blinks a moment of her eyes at the sight of white columns, brick façades and green grasses.
Graciela’s parents had only been able to finish high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Also, while she and other Grade 8 (4th) students from the group explored Gettysburg where tuition fees are <0x24>38,690 per year, her attitude was less that of a new student impressed than enthusiastic.
That’s where I’m going to study! exclamated Graciela who would like to study medicine, while the guide guide guided them to the entrance of the building of the sciences.
Youpi, really? she said shy, when she was told the low ratio of law professor-student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh children visited during their three-day discovery trip and now they had completely integrated the message: The question is not whether you are going to university:
The question is where.
Although this question still raises a great deal for the large number of American children born to Hispanic immigrant parents who left high school where they became parents at adolescence, they are also hundreds of thousands to benefit from university education that will allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "one in five Hispanics of the "second generation" went to high school - a notable success considering that so many of their immigrant parents, most of Mexico or Central America, entered the United States without graduating from high school.
Their success is important, the researchers say, they are paving the way for future generations who will play an important role in the country's workforce.
Researchers who study battants claim that they have a natural affinity with the school and an innate need for success.
Many are also those whose parents set high goals for their children and who find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
Mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to university -- especially if her efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at the children of low-income families with parents who don't have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, won't help them, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at Davis, California University of California, who has
We need to think about offering a network of support to these children, from parenting to high school.
The federal program that funded the visit of Graciela universities is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP (prepare yourself), it provides more than <0x24>300 million a year to local school systems to organize university preparatory programs that start when students from low-income families are in middle school (college) and continue until the end of high school years.
Since 1999, the program has been followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent entering the university, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
The Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum Gets Agreements with 10 Foreign Oil Companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its difficult infrastructure during two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements obtained by the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum with foreign oil companies suggest that the oil companies of China, Russia and Europe are about to play a major role in the restoration of Iraq's oil industry, invalidated by decades of invalidation.
U.S. companies have split in just two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven U.S. companies had paid to participate in the second auction that began on Friday.
The only one who had put an auction was lost.
Two U.S. companies have obtained contracts for the auctioned fields in June.
The low representation of U.S. oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, Asian and European companies are paving the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news site.
It will take a long time for another offer to be made in Iraq.
Security concerns, corroborated by mass coordinated bombings, Tuesday, and political instability as U.S. military troops retreated, hampered U.S. oil companies, preventing them from entering more forcefully Iraq, which holds the largest reserve of the world.
American companies were, in some cases, disadvantaged because of their rivals, in particular Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, whose labor costs were considerably lower and who were more willing to take risks because they did not have to account for them.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to obtain contracts with the Department.
Major U.S. companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who have maintained strong ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum and provided technical advice, have left their hands empty.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
Chinese National Petroleum Corp., owned by the state, has more bids on contracts than other companies and is distributed with significant stakes in contracts for two major fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power, said Assam Jihad, a spokesman for the Ministry of Petroleum.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be equal with its competitors and will fulfill its commitments in Iraq.
Pre-selected auction companies made bids which were then compared to the barrel tariff that the department agreed to pay to motivate production above the current levels for each field.
One of al-Qaeda’s leading organizers has been killed in Pakistan
It appears that a U.S. missile, having hit along the border with Afghanistan, killed one of the organizers of al-Qaeda operations this week, U.S. counter-espionage authorities said Friday.
If the information is confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on one of the terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men suspected of being killed by a pair of missiles fired in their car on Tuesday near the city of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities said the missiles had been fired by an unmanned aircraft of the type used by the CIA, inside Pakistan’s anarchist tribal border.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, a Pakistani civilian intelligence service member said, speaking on the phone of Miran Shah.
Authorities said the suspected local activists rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what remained of the "totally shattered bodies".
It was totally impossible for local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two U.S. anti-terrorist representatives provided unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as one of al-Qaeda's military organizers leading the group's terrorist operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
His role was to organize conspiracies around the world, said one of the authorities who wanted to remain anonymous, citing the sensitive nature of airstrikes within Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracies for attacks on the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic directions of al-Qaeda leaders and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second U.S. official said that Somalia had progressed rapidly in the ranks of al-Qaeda and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be known to the American public, but it does not diminish the threat it poses to us and our allies, the second official said.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second major al-Qaeda figure or the second Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a tribal-belt militant faction, as well as three other operatives.
The pace of attacks by CIA drones has decreased since the summer, from about six operations per month to two, according to figures advanced by the Long War Journal, a website moderated by a non-profit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics of terrorist groups that have progressed to reduce their vulnerability while also ruthlessly killing suspected informants, the site says.
UN Special Envoy to Kabul withdraws
U.N. Special Envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday that he would resign in March following a tumultuous term ensued with widespread corruption allegations during the U.N.-backed presidential election.
Eide's departure comes as the Obama administration has decided to send another 30,000 troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supported the increase but expressed concern over the U.S. schedule for a withdrawal of troops that would begin in 18 months and would force other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to the Afghans and remind them that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview in Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international officials assisting the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said he would not resign but would simply respect the commitment he had made to his family in March to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to warn the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows he has time to find a replacement.
I just said it was better to start looking for my replacement, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month gap between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban has already begun to seek a replacement.
Representatives claim that the name Staffan di Mistura has been cited; this is an Italian-Swiss citizen who recently presided over a UN mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led UN peacekeeping operations.
Eide's reputation in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai during the presidential election and concealing evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied these allegations but said that Galbraith’s accusations — who were thanked — “have been detrimental to the mission because there was already a good dose of skepticism with regard to international election observation.”
Eide said that he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the assistance of U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged UN officials to authorize his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries than he was assigned to the mission in Afghanistan, saying that this would give them more confidence in how their money is spent.
Eide expressed frustration about the limits of his powers in Afghanistan, saying that the heavy UN hiring regulations were hampering his ability to bring new talents.
The UN rules are such that I have been able to recruit only one person since May, he said.
It's catastrophic and it can't last.
Gates: Iran should be subject to additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world’s major powers would soon impose “significant additional sanctions” on Iran due to its inability to engage in talks on nuclear ambitions.
Speaking in front of a departure of 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq, during a week-long visit to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, Gates de-dramatized the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier’s question about the possibility of such a detachment.”
One of the things that weighs the most on me is that if I have learned something in Iraq over the last six years, it is the unpredictable side inherent in the war.
The Obama administration considers a set of sanctions targeting Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates said some of these sanctions could also affect Iranians on the streets.
He said a "set of motivations and penalties" could be needed to persuade the Iranian government that it would actually be less secure with nuclear weapons" because "their people would suffer enormously" from these sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined the European leaders in a warning that Iran will face "probable" consequences if it does not bring its nuclear program back in full compliance with the UN Security Council, the United Nations and its agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop its nuclear experience only for a peaceful purpose.
In talks in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he would resume the dialogue on the reduction of his nuclear program and agreed to abandon a significant portion of his enriched uranium storage, in exchange for fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration pushed for such an agreement, a means of developing trust on both sides and saving time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran has appeared to have distanced itself from attempts to agree – in part, experts say, because Iranian leadership is divided on whether or not to engage with the United States.
In my opinion, Iran's stiffening against some of the international community's proposals, for which they had actually agreed in early October, has prompted the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to join what they had not stated, in terms of major counter-sanctions, Iran's Ghats added.
President Obama set December 31 as a deadline for Iran to respond to proposals, before turning to other options, including pursuing what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “increased sanctions.”
In a statement in New York on Thursday, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it calls "unfounded allegations" by some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities and said it agreed to continue negotiations with the United States in a long-term, globally satisfactory and then five other major countries.
Gates, who was due to return to Washington late Friday, met Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning before taking the plane to the Kurdish oil-rich region to meet with troops in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tensions continue between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and income sharing.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid any delays in U.S. plans to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
The U.S. authorities have quoted Mr. Gates, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government, as saying: "We will preserve your security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq."
We will not abandon you.”
In aging China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters saying, "Mother Earth is too tired to welcome more children" and "An extra baby is a plus grave".
They learned so well from the lesson that the government of Shanghai, alarmed by the insufficient rate of natality of their city and the aging of the population, radically changed direction this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child; their reaction was never instantaneous and ironic.
We have already given all our time and all our energy to one child.
There is no second left for us,” said Wang, 31, Human Resources Director, who has an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the single child policy in China, creating two generations of unique children notably with good plays and spoiled, nicknamed the "little emperors", a population crisis threatens the country.
According to the United Nations, the average birth rate fell by 1.8 children per couple compared to six when the policy was implemented.
The population distribution, while it is projected that the number of residents aged 60 and over will explode, from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent in 2050. This figure is well above the overall average of about 20 per cent.
This imbalance is even worse in rich coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of the population of registered residents in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission (Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission) said that fertile couples should have babies in order to "help to reduce the proportion of the aging population and prevent a shortage of hands in the future".
Shanghai is about to become "as old - but not as rich, however - as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
Progressive mitigation
Written in the country's constitution in 1978, the Chinese policy of the single child is, to this day, undoubtedly the most controversial obligation introduced by the communist government.
Couples who violate this policy may have to pay colossal fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and be discriminated against in the workplace.
The Chinese authorities have attributed the duty to the police to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while human rights lawyers have denounced abuses in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some representatives of the authority forced pregnant women of a second child to abort.
In addition, many couples have resorted to selective abortions leading to an abnormally high boy-girl ratio.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually softened their position on the policy of the single child.
In 2004, they granted more exceptions to the rule -- including for urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which men and women are already single children -- and in 2007, they softened many of their harsh slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at Beijing University, said central government authorities have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters encouraging families to have only one child have been replaced by copies of detailed regulations that have the right to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city’s government has sent family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples at home, and slide prospectus under their door.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child.
According to the head of family planning, the response was disappointing.
Disappointing response
While officials in a rural suburb of Shanghai say they have seen an increase in requests for records of couples wishing for a second child after the campaign launched, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, still receives only four to five requests per month.
Officials in Shanghai, disappointed, say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only about 165,000 -- slightly higher than 2009 but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, Head of the Family Planning Committee in Caolu Municipality of Shanghai, said financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don’t want to have more children.
They want to provide for their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and that they are legally allowed.
But like many Chinese, they only have the minimum health insurance and life insurance provided by the government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
Westerners wrongly believe that the policy of the single child is a rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant with seven months of the couple's first child.
It's true, we're being robbed of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
That's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their hesitation.
Wang, Human Resources Manager, said she wanted only a single child because she was one of her own. "We were the center of the family and we used to have everyone take care of us."
We don’t have the habit of taking care of someone else and we really don’t want to take care of others.”
Chen Zijian, 42 years old and owner of a translation company, says it more harshly.
For middle-class couples working at two, who lower the birth rate, he says, you have to be selfish in order to succeed.
People aged 20 or 30 have grown up watching their parents fight in the early days of capitalist China and don’t want to have this lifestyle on their own, he says.
Even a single child requires a lot of time from his parents, he says.
A mother must give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there's the space issues -- "You need to change your apartment" -- and the planning -- "When your child is only 9 months old, you need to write his CV to get a place in the best maternal home."
Most of his friends are ready for this experience once, Chen says, but not two.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, he says.
We don’t want to make too many sacrifices.
The United Nations Group has plans for emission reductions
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- so far characterized by disorganized assignments and mutual recriminations -- returned under the lights of the ramp on Friday, due to the publication of a document highlighting the ambitious reductions in greenhouse gas emissions over the next 40 years, with the industrialization of the next 40 years.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles, as much as it clarified the way forward.
But it was seen as a major breakthrough in the time lacking negotiations, with more than 100 leaders from around the world arriving in Copenhagen next week.
Written by a UN special working group, the text does not say how much rich countries would give to the poor to support global warming, both in the long term and in the future.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how developed economies and emerging economies could reduce their carbon production and what would be the upper limit of the global temperature rise that those responsible would be willing to tolerate.
It gives great flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, Representative in Washington of the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote six pages of the document, studied a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what UN Secretary-General Yvo de Boer described as "the full picture".
It sets out the guidelines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations would collectively reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 per cent compared to 1990 levels in 2020, while major developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 per cent during the same period.
Together, countries would reduce emissions by between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also resumed negotiations on Friday, promising to provide <0x24>3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impacts of climate change -- to endure floods and droughts or to avoid deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbal altercations occurred, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, the U.S. Climate Negotiation Representative, rejected any discussion requiring the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialized countries, compared to voluntary efforts by major emerging economies, if they were not funded by developed countries.
This change is the signal that the Obama administration is getting harder toward China than the Bush administration did two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without the efforts and actions of major developing countries, Stern said, who also regretted that the text did not insist enough to ensure that the reductions could be verified by external observers.
Stern commented an hour after China's deputy foreign minister He Yafei said the U.S. chief negotiator, either lacking "good sense" or was "extremely irresponsible" for saying earlier in the week that the U.S. would not help the climate to counter the chinese.
With the future economic trajectory of the major global powers at stake, flaws have emerged both within the Third World and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more about saving the individual economies than saving the planet, with China and the United States complaining about their respective obligations while the poorer nations insisting that the two dozen most influential countries will be ignorant of the more scientific imperatives of cogitar.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it was not surprising that the major powers are fighting to find out who should suffer the costs of reducing greenhouse gases, even though vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempts to make their big emissors accountable.
It is really a game in which a new economic hegemony is developed, said Ulate, who is also Climate Advisor for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of these countries that are more vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to put pressure on a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the major participants say the negotiations will lead to a minimum, to a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which brings together 43 members, drafted a 24-page treaty proposal early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, head of the European Commission’s climate unit, said small island states’ action “has put political pressure on the entire political process”, partly because they are now unified and they ask emerging economies such as China and India to act.
The debates became an urgent matter, while delegates focused on the fact that they had to solve most of the issues before heads of government reached an agreement.
High-level officials such as the Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister got off their plane and rushed to the Bella Center building to attend house-closed meetings and information conferences, so that they can make follow-up complaints.
The real picture of the gathering -- during which 13,000 people enter and leave the Palace of Congress every day -- of guitar-playing activists presenting nightly performances mocking countries that they believe are betraying and that proposals are drafted and distributed on paper rather than by email -- is a real challenge.
The intensity is only increasing: almost all major ministers are here and no later than Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the court of the greats," said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice President for Global Conservation International Policy.
Heavy weights are coming.
In Britain, the first train at 225 km/h will redefine Monday's syndrome
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, a whirlwind will pierce at night to signal the departure of a train that will mark a transport revolution in Britain.
The country’s first high-speed suburban train will reach 225 km/h, while it will fly from Ashford, Kent, to London St Pancras, covering the 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes on board the first suburban Javelin train outside London.
He hopes that the new service will enable Britain to integrate an international network of fast and reliable trains and connect the major cities of the Midlands, Northern and Scotland to London.
Lost small holes will become flourishing suburbs, business trips will be much shorter, and the passage from plane and car to train will reduce domestic carbon emissions while reducing road traffic bottlenecks.
In theory, the three main political parties are adhering to this project.
But the ten billion pounds needed to build a new railroad network, the inevitable planning battle and fears of environmental hazards risk slowing British high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to produce a feasibility report for the government, will return its document to Lord Adonis on December 30.
This will allow him to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next planned step for the high-speed network.
The new line connecting London to the West Midlands will be drawn within five metres of the urban area and sites where the environmental impact can be controversial.
In the countryside, the plan will be drawn up to 25 meters from the final route.
It is also expected that HS2 will have three options for a larger high-speed network heading north.
Lord Adonis will answer in the spring.
The privileged options are highlighted in a Y configuration for which a high-speed line will go to the West Midlands.
The line will split into two or near Birmingham, with a branch heading west of the Penninsula in Manchester and Scotland and another heading northeast, towards Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line will cross Scotland.
"It looks like it will be the best performance option," said a rail professional.
When this is done, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open until 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to a current one-hour journey.
The proposals will allow the train to travel at 400km/h, making the UK’s fastest network in the world.
The initial track is designed to allow trains of 400m long and able to carry 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on the London - Birmingham route.
A terminal that can accommodate 20,000 passengers per hour would be required.
Given the space constraints, it is planned that an existing station will be expanded to receive the high-speed network.
Rail industry experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this possibility.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he thinks the project should be implemented, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken before a general election.
Even if it launches the machine, the network will have to be built part by part.
Trains will first be forced to drive off high-speed lines on existing rails north of Birmingham, retaining journey durations between London and Scotland of more than three hours.
This solution seems to be the best way to ensure the passage from aircraft to trains, making it a benchmark for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers Refund <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 Loan for Tory Orangery
Alan Duncan, the top member of Tory's parliament, has paid the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year to reimburse the cost of an orangery he built in his county home.
The party official, who was retreated by David Cameron for complaining that MPs were "maintained", raised his <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 loan to build an oak extension to his second home in Rutland.
He had been allowed to pay the additional interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds per month, to the taxpayer.
The Commons authorities received the complaints at the time and were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who controls the members' expenses. Last night, Mr Duncan said that the complaints could not be "clearer or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the wealthiest members of parliament, is the owner of a two-story house in a village in his district of Rutland - Melton.
The neighboring houses were sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, a living room and a dining room, but the Emoluments Bureau claims that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a veranda to the house, describing it in his plans as an orange grove.
Neighbors describe it as a "veranda for pleasure".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to provide an explanation for the increase in borrowing during a recent investigation by the Committee on the Privileges and Standards of the Commons regarding its prior borrowing provisions.
The Committee found him innocent last month of any allegations of non-compliance with the rules, following an investigation into its expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal security of the <0xC2><0xA3>271,406 loan from his London property to the house of his constituency he bought in 1991, the year before becoming a member of parliament.
Documents published this week show that Mr. Duncan claimed about GBP 1,400 per month of borrowing interest until March last year.
In April, its demands increased by more than <0xC2><0xA3>1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr. Duncan's RBS loan was not changed at that time, suggesting that all the increases were intended to finance the loan of <0xC2><0xA3>75,000.
The RBS standard variable interest rate rose from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March this year, without moving since then.
The latest publication by the Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to request GBP 1,250 in May.
Duncan lost his position as Head of the Ghost Cabinet in September, after a covert journalist allegedly filmed him stating that members of parliament should survive "on budget" after the spending scandal.
"In fact, it's national now, you have to live "on budget" and you've been treated as "of the m...e"
He said: “I spent my money on my garden and asked for a small part, based on what was right.
I could have asked for more, but I didn’t.”
The member of parliament, a millionaire since his former position as an oil negotiator, began to have to explain his expenses in May after it appeared that he had asked thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the office of expenses that this "may be considered as ex.
An activist dug a <0xC2><0xA3>1-shaped hole in Mr Duncan’s lawn to protest after it was revealed he had demanded <0xC2><0xA3>4,000 for three years.
Asked about the increase in the loan last night, Mr. Duncan said: "It was for major improvements, approved both by the fee office and then by Legg."
He added: "There is no problem with stealing or developing or using the rules or anything.
It was quite clear, in the rules, allowed, etc.
It couldn’t be cleaner or simpler.”
Believers, come and see the calendar of the Advent of Brighton
The beach cabins in Brighton have found a new way to promote the winter months, an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cabin for each December day, using Christmas songs as a theme.
The event began on December 1, when visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 17:30 to 18:30, every day, with pasta and hot wine served for free.
The Christmas songs chosen so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas", for which the cabin presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a Hove TV marketing assistant, is an unpaid priest from the diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.
He said: “We want religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
"As a Church, why do we wait for people to enter a strange old building? It seems to me that the Church should get closer to people and celebrate in a more captivating way.
"The idea of the Advent calendar of the beach cabin came just after a conversation with a few friends, during a dinner.
Brighton is such a creative and vibrant place and we’re trying to experiment and represent it through spirituality.”
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for climate change
Tens of thousands of people protested on Saturday to call for an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against global warming, around the world and in Copenhagen, where police conducted several hundred interrogations.
At least 30,000 people, according to the police, a hundred thousand according to the organizers, marched in the cold in the Danish capital, on the sidelines of the United Nations Climate Conference, which is expected to reach an agreement to enter into force by Friday, January 1, 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the climate conference, the growing global climate mobilization, illustrated by these demonstrations, has helped make "the political price" of a very high failure in Copenhagen.
The incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the departure of the courthouse, when a group of 300 protesters, wholly dressed in black, broke windows with pavements and hammers, an AFP reporter noted.
Anti-smoke policemen immediately intervened without a home.
In total, the police announced the interview of 600 to 700 people, essentially members of the "Black Blocs", these ultra-violent clusters that had been illustrated, in particular, at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action Coalition (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of militants were intercepted "without distinction", stressing that a hundred of them "were still held in the street on Saturday night".
Parliament's party, the courthouse, rather good child, took the lead of the Bella Center, the negotiating site.
Protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building, without trying to penetrate it.
A scene had been erected to accommodate the expected speakers, before a candle-watching with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the protesters had come by car and train from major European cities, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in waterproof blue sky, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the appeal of the Friends of the Earth, who heard forming "blue tides" for "climate justice".
Today, we are going down the streets to seek ecological debt reparation for the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Philippine activist from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot continue to say: we have time, said the Benin singer Angélique Kidjo.
There are rivers drying up in Africa, rivers where you can walk like you’ve never done before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the altermondialist movement drew closer to environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure in altermondialism, explained that he had come to Copenhagen to “bind climate justice and social justice”: “Today, there is no break between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world.”
The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many islands that are particularly vulnerable to warming, was the start of the protests.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, were down the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, paraded in red, with bandanas boasting solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, but also in Canada, a few hundred protesters also called for energetic action against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the network "350" gathered a few hundred people, including in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
A few dozen people gathered in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia denounces a "farce"
Abkhazia on Saturday elected its president, just over a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia, while Tbilisi denounced a "farce".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in this first election after the 2008 Russo-Georgian War for control of South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
Voting offices closed at 17:00 GMT.
The participation rate was 58% a few hours before the closing, according to officials of the Abkhaz Electoral Commission.
The first provisional results were to be announced on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
The five running candidates, including the exit president Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemned the holding of the election.
These elections are a farce.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili "reports that Abkhazia has fallen under the total occupation of Russia," said his spokeswoman, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it as part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separating from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, which caused several thousand deaths, Abkhazia seeks to show through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
“This process is a step in our new life, our new era as an independent state,” Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, told AFP.
She was among the voters who went to the polling station in a school in Soukhoumi, the capital, in a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The issue of Russian domination is at the heart of the presidency in this region of lush landscapes, on the shores of the Black Sea.
Wide panels showing Mr. Bagapch alongside the Russian President and Prime Minister, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are installed almost everywhere in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the western part of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, reserved a warm welcome to Russian officials who came to monitor the election.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said during a small ceremony, in allusion to the support of Moscow, in particular the decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, replied Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, raising a glass of vodka.
The opposition, represented in the election by former vice-president Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticized the agreements concluded with Moscow last year, such as the one giving Russia control over the Abkhaz railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support the current power or the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is required to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: global protests, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people marched around the world on Saturday to call for an ambitious and binding deal at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where police, on whom they live, arrested nearly 700 people on the verge of an imposing demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, a hundred thousand according to the organizers, marched in the cold in the afternoon in the Danish capital, which until December 18 welcomes delegates from 193 countries, looking for an agreement to enter into force on January 1, 2013.
Parliament's party, the courthouse, overall good child, took over the direction of the Bella Center, where the negotiations take place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center, without trying to penetrate it.
A scene had been erected to accommodate the expected speakers, before a candle-watching with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the departure of the courthouse, a group of a few hundred protesters, wholly dressed in black, armed with bricks and hammers, broke windows, an AFP reporter noted.
Anti-smoke police immediately surrounded them and intervened homelessly, throwing several of them to the ground.
Police announced the interview of 600 to 700 people, stating that they were mainly members of the Black Blocs, these ultra-violent clusters that had been illustrated at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, in April.
At the end of the afternoon, a police officer was wounded in the jaw by a pavement and four cars burned near a squat during incidents that led to the interrogation of about twenty people, according to police.
We have the extremist groupuscules in sight, had warned police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the law enforcement forces were spinning in the sky.
The majority of the protesters, coming by car and train from major cities in Germany, London, Amsterdam or Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in waterproof blue sky, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the appeal of the Friends of the Earth, who heard forming "blue tides" for "climate justice".
Today, we are going down the streets to seek ecological debt reparation for the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Philippine activist from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot continue to say: we have time, said the Benin singer Angélique Kidjo.
There are rivers that dries up in Africa, there are rivers where you can walk while you’ve never done it before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the altermondialist movement drew closer to environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure in altermondialism, told AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to “bind climate justice and social justice”: “Today, there is no break between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world.”
The Oxfam organization mobilized several figures, including Danish model Helena Christensen, former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, to address the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many islands that are particularly vulnerable to warming, was the start of the protests.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, were down the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, protested, dressed in red and with bandanas boasting the solar energy in front of the Philippine capital city hall.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, a few hundred protesters also called for action against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the network "350" gathered a few hundred people, including in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
A few dozen people gathered in Geneva.
The geo-history is reinforced by the reform of the general high school, according to Chatel
National Education Minister Luc Chatel said in an interview to appear in the JDD Sunday that history and geography were “enforced” from the general high school reform, despite the abolition of their compulsory education into a scientific terminal.
From now on, the primary students will have all four hours a week and the same program for a shared culture, says Chatel.
For the minister, "it is necessary to get out of the hypocrisy" because, according to him, "the S branch is no longer a scientific branch" but "in general, it concentrates the best students".
The ES and L branches cannot remain sub-branches of the S, he continues, underlining: "I have also not heard many historians and intellectuals anger themselves at the absence of end-to-end history-geography in technological high schools."
On Saturday, a Ifop poll published in Humanity revealed that nearly seven out of ten (69 per cent) French people disagreed with the government’s plan to abolish compulsory history-geography education in terminal S. Many intellectuals and teachers have also criticized this abolition, as well as the right of left and certain people.
The Minister, on the other hand, added that it was "no question" to delete the philosophy of the terminal S program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which they believe is sacrificing the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), they will pass an eligibility test at the beginning of the year that will cover their discipline, and then at the end of the year an admission test that will cover their ability to teach, the minister explained.
They will also follow internships in position during the M2 year and then be a first year in front of students as interns.
If you add all the internships offered before the competition, you already get more attendance in front of the students, which is more than 300 hours, he continued.
Finally, the Minister says that he will propose "the individual right to education, which does not exist in national education".
He also reaffirms the plan to remove the school card "by 2012".
At Normal Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince about climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the issues of the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel of Experts on Climate Evolution (GIEC) invited by the Ulm Street Superior Normal School, raised on Saturday morning.
Jean Jouzel, also Nobel Peace Prize laureate, inaugurated the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a day consisting of a chain of expert interventions, 15 minutes each, filmed and open to the public, a journalist from AFP found.
We wanted to do something that catches people and gives them the desire to know more, explained Edouard Hannezo, 22, one of the organizers of the day that takes his name from the one given by the students to the fish in the school basin.
Twenty speakers are selected from the experts in their discipline and selected for their charismatic side, he said.
"We can talk about hours, but we can also talk about key goals in a few minutes," Jean Jouzel, who spoke without notes, but with the help of graphics, told AFP.
This is part of our role as a scientist, he stressed, hoping that the auditors will hold that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific dossier."
Videos taken from these conferences will be posted online on the school’s website from December 15.
The next day "Ernest" is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bi-monthly pace.
Delayed payments: anger of prison guards, planned actions
The prison watchdog unions called on Friday for "general mobilization" to demand the payment by the end of the year holidays of bonuses and extra hours whose payment was postponed to January for budgetary reasons.
FO-penitentiary (2nd watchdog union) asked staff who will not be in service to protest in front of prisons on Tuesday morning and "block them" to "denounce the theft of their debts".
The CGT-penitentiary (3rd trade union of the profession) calls on them to "assemble in general assemblies in the various prisons for a strong mobilization", deeming "honest and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of "overtimes, night premiums, Sundays and public holidays".
And the first watchdog union, the Federal Autonomous Union Penitentiary (UFAP/UNA), “invokes general mobilization (...) to bring back discontent and anger.”
The Department of the Penitentiary Administration and the Department of Justice explain that the extra hours have increased a lot in 2009 and not all have been budgeted, but ensure that the remaining ones will be paid in January.
The Chancellor said at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the watchdog unions guaranteeing that the payment would be made next month.
I do not ignore the efforts made by staff for the functioning and modernization of our prison system, the Minister of Justice wrote in the letter.
I have asked the Directorate of the Penitentiary Administration to implement without delay a set of measures to ensure that this situation arising from a poor assessment of the number of extra hours does not repeat itself in the future, adds Ms Alliot-Marie.
The December pay will therefore be slim, except for senior management staff who are eligible for renowned job and goals awards, Ufap/UNA regretted, for which "budget constraints have good backs".
It is a pure scandal, the FO inter-regional union in Marseille hated, announcing its decision to boycott to new order "all meetings and convocations".
Staff will not come to work on their Sundays and holidays unless those of the month of October are regularized in December, same for overtime, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when our tasks and missions are increased without increasing our staff, it is more than regrettable to dare to take care of the staff money, according to the CGT-Center of Bordeaux.
According to trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, with some being less badly affected than others.
But anyway, the account is not there, said the Ufap secretary-general, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama Says Offering “Beautiful Things” Than He Receives
U.S. President Barack Obama, who is about to spend his first Christmas with his family at the White House, confided to small screen Oprah Winfrey that he had a simple gift rule: “I give things nicer than those I get.”
As part of a special show that will be broadcast on Sunday evening on ABC, the president and his wife Michelle provide an overview of how they intend to celebrate the holidays at the end of the year in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family, will be in the party.
The Santa also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, stating that the dog would "of course" have a gift, according to extracts from the show broadcast in advance.
And Michelle Obama faked her husband’s statements about the quality of the gifts he receives: “I certainly didn’t, I offered you nice gifts last year,” she said.
Absolutely, was he forced to give up before he humbly replicated, pointing to the First Lady's pearl necklace with his finger, "Who gave you this?"
During this one-hour show, in a relaxed atmosphere, with the famous animator who was a fervent supporter of Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite gifts as children.
Barack Obama mentioned a ten-speed bike, but also a basketball that his Kenyan father rarely saw offered him at Christmas.
I remember this time when I met my dad came to see us for Christmas and where he gave me a basketball, the president said.
It was not until much later in my life that I realized that it was he who gave me this ball.
The First Lady remembered her side of her doll house.
I really didn’t know how to arrange a house so I had aligned all the furniture against the wall, rather than arranging them around the fireplace, but I loved this little doll house, said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday Reopened, RTL Says He's in Artificial Coma
Johnny Hallyday was re-opened in Los Angeles due to significant "lations" after surgery in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his surroundings, while RTL claims the singer has been placed in artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was re-operated in the night of Wednesday to Thursday at the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after U.S. doctors found "the lesions resulting from the surgery" of the discal hernia underwent in Paris on November 26, his press service said in a statement.
The singer's press service, however, wanted to reassure him that the situation was "under control", while announcing that a new medical bulletin would be communicated no later than 48 hours.
According to RTL, partner of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was, however, plunged into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
It is only within 48 hours that we will have a little more certainty about the patient’s condition when he has opened an eye, RTL adds.
Asked by AFP, the press service did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that "according to some sources" no drain would have been placed after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated on at the international clinic of Parc Monceau for this disc hernia.
The intervention, scheduled for several days, had been practiced by the neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known physician in the artistic environment.
This one was not available Thursday night to comment on RTL's information.
Following the operation he performed on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized Monday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles for a consecutive infection.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, said on RTL on Thursday that his friend was going through “a bad pass,” but assured him “no worries” about the rocker, who is “a batterer.”
“He called me just before I left for Los Angeles, and I told him it was bullshit because flying 12 hours after such an operation, it’s not playable,” Mitchell said.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, wanted to reassure himself, stating that Johnny Hallyday "reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "induced".
Mr. Camus had also said that he had interviewed Laeticia, the singer's wife, and had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer’s health problems have only increased since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to general surprise, Johnny Hallyday had revealed that he had undergone a “small colon cancer” and then a slight infection.
In late September, the singer resumed his long "Tour 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been abundantly commented. Fans and journalists have noticed the singer’s difficulties in moving on stage.
In mid-November, his surroundings even had to deny a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small basin: Bousquet’s first on its fetish distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, who won three medals at the 2009 World Cup in a large pool, won an international title on a distance he particularly likes, the 50 m free swimming, during the Euro 2009 in a small pool in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition where combinations are allowed for the last time saw only three world records beaten while awaiting a draw.
One was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto on 200 m 4 swimming and the other two by Russia in relay gentlemen 4x50 m 4 swimming.
A regret for Bousquet, who stood on the world record of the 50 m free, of which he holds the brand in the large basin (20.94).
On one of the two queen distances of swimming, the 50 m free, it was the 28-year-old Frenchman who took on in 20 sec 53 in a final where ten swimmers took off against usually eight, the first on an international level.
Bousquet advanced Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to lower the world mark (20.30) as he had planned.
One can always dream better and in the event, I would have said that if the world record was at my fingertips, I would try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were dressed in polyurethane combinations, which will be banned from January 1.
Starting with 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations ended their season in Istanbul, which had hosted the first in 1999, during the same competition.
The use of the combinations did not serve this time the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in the large basin this summer in Rome, world records at the key.
The young swimmer failed to lower the mark he holds on 400 m free swimming (3:32.77) but nevertheless imposed himself by signing the second best time of his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.8.)
I didn’t go deep on this race.
I knew I couldn’t beat a world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and I accomplished my mission.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
USA: Zola-owned sarcophagus panel awarded <0x24>1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus panel belonging to French writer Emile Zola was awarded <0x24>1.5 million on Thursday, well above his estimate, art merchant Sotheby's announced.
This two-meter-long, 63 cm-high front panel, dating from the 3rd century BC, was estimated to be between <0x24>150,000 and <0x24>250,000.
The marble "representing four Dionysian scenes in a sophisticated architectural decor, surrounded by satires and baccarats, is a rare piece, there are only four or five of them in the world," Florent Heintz, vice-president of art auctions in Sobyzenne, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold among a hundred lots.
The sale is still underway but this lot is certainly the one that buyers have the most bid on so far, Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
The discovery of the acquisition of this marble by Emile Zola dates back to a few days.
The panel remained in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous collection of the Borghese family, and then appeared successively at the French actress Cécile Sorel, who had made it an element of her bathtub in her Parisian private hotel, and at Paul Reynaud, Minister of the Pre-Republic of the French Pre-Republic in the Pre-Republic of the Pêvent.
It remained a shadowy area of about fifty years.
By scanning the Louvre database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of a "Emile Zola succession" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco of "Rougon-Macquart".
Attempting Abortion from Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico
Mexico said on Thursday that conditions were no longer met for the transfer to its territory of the deceased President of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who was refused a Putschist government-backed coup.
At the moment, after a phone conversation overnight with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that the possibilities for this transfer are not met, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
Arriving in El Salvador on Wednesday to take Zelaya back, the Mexican government’s plane returned to its place of origin, according to a source from the Directorate-General for Migration.
The Putschist government wanted to force Zelaya to "resign" and ask for political asylum abroad to grant him a bailout.
But the late president refused, because he wanted to go to Mexico as a guest head of state in the exercise.
The Putschist government “has suffered a new failure by wanting me to resign from office (...), they wanted me to resign,” Zelaya told Globo radio on Thursday, which he has often spoken about since the beginning of the five-month political crisis in Central America.
I can stay here for ten years, here I have my guitar, added by playing some chords the deceased president, who has been a refugee at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
Mexico’s embassy has filed an application for non-conduct, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an asylum application, the Interior Minister of the Putschist government, Oscar Raul Matute, told Honduran radio HRN on Wednesday.
I do not ask for asylum from any country, had answered Manuel Zelaya in an interview with Telesur, headquartered in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras will have to be made as the president of the Honduran people, he said.
Zelaya’s departure rumors mobilized on Wednesday supporters of the deceased president, who came to gather around the Brazilian embassy, where the military reinforced their headquarters.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim has criticized the position of the Putschist government.
This demonstrates the marginality of this government towards international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached Venezuelan socialist president Hugo Chavez, was overthrown on June 28, the day he held a popular consultation to prepare for his re-election, against the opinion of the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
Exiled to Costa Rica, he returned by surprise on September 21 and fled to the Brazilian embassy.
If he comes out, he will be arrested for the crime of "high treason" accused by the justice, according to the putschist government.
Putschist President Roberto Micheletti managed to hold a presidential election on November 29 to replace Mr Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected during the controversial election recognized by the United States but contested by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, Congress massively voted against the return of Mr. Zelaya to power until the end of his term on 27 January.
Wall Street rises, U.S. trade balance fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended up on Thursday, with U.S. trade balance figures showing both the U.S. and its partners resumed: the Dow Jones gained 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased from 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, and the technologically dominant Nasdaq from 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 expanded to 0.58% (6.40 points) at 1,102.35 points.
We have good news from different sectors of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But this remains anecdotal, she tempered, estimating that the market was focusing on "the half-full glass".
According to Peter Cardillo, of Avalon Partners, investors have focused primarily on U.S. trade balance figures, “which show that the business is improving in the fourth quarter.”
The U.S. trade deficit fell by 7.6% in October compared to September, to <0x24>32.9 billion.
Analysts, on the other hand, expected an increase in the deficit.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is that the growth in trade volumes, especially for goods exports, reflects the growth of the economies of the major U.S. trading partners, said Christopher Cornell, of the research firm Economy.com.
On the other hand, new U.S. unemployment registrations increased against expectations last week, reaching 474,000 applications.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers "has fallen to the lowest in a year," said Scott Marcouiller, of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bond increased to 3.482% against 3.423% on Tuesday night and that of the 30-year bond to 4.492% against 4.408% on the eve.
Cuba: Hundreds of Power Advocates Combine “White Ladies”
A few hundred Cuban power supporters on Thursday conspired against the wives of political detainees gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day, and prevented another demonstration for which a dozen dissidents were arrested.
About forty "White Ladies", wives or close relatives of political prisoners, were taken to the streets by supporters of Raul Castro's government as they marched towards the center of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, an AFP reporter said.
Downstairs the Yankees!, "mercenaries!", "the street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Live Fidel and Raul!", the supporters of the power to the dissidents shouted.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents who came "to ensure their protection".
On the eve, a similar demonstration took place against the "white ladies" in Havana, without any injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana neighborhood of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to protest on Thursday for the International Day for Human Rights were, they were intercepted by civilian police, an AFP reporter noted.
The police force force in civilian vehicles the dissidents who were conscripted by supporters of the government, according to the reporter.
The interviews of dissidents in similar circumstances generally only last a few hours.
Recipients of the Sakharov Prize in 2005 in the European Parliament, the “white ladies” had organized an unauthorized march to “demand the release of all political prisoners”, in the number of 200, according to dissent, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Mr. Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remain under lockdown.
Cuban authorities view opponents as “mercenaries” or “agents” on the balance of their declared enemy, the United States.
Very rarely, Cuban television reported Thursday's demonstration of pro-government activists against "counter-revolutionaries".
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of violating rights and freedoms, including freedoms of expression.
Forced man kills an octogenaire with a knife and wounds 5 in Clichy-la-Garenne
A gunman armed with two knives killed an octogenaire and wounded five others in downtown Clichy-la-Garenne, Hauts-de-Seine, at an hour of crawling, Thursday at the end of the day.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old allegedly hit with two knives and for indeterminate reasons, an octogenaire, in or in front of a pharmacy at 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaurès, police sources and witnesses said.
Gravely wounded, the old man, born in 1929 according to a police union official Alliance, died in the hospital as a result of his injuries.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he then took care of a couple, whose wife was pregnant.
The 30-year-old husband interposed and was injured.
The first two victims, severely wounded, were admitted to the hospital where the octopus succumbed.
The other wounded's days are in danger, with vital organs apparently affected, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman then made a discomfort and was hospitalized “in shock,” according to a police source.
The armed man, who seemed under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would then have fled to the street, still boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He would have wounded two passers-by, apparently by chance: a thirty-year-old and a square-year-old, the latter severely.
The script was confused in the evening.
He was armed with two knives that he was carrying in a cross behind his back, an Alliance official in Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé, said on the spot.
Several passers-by, including young people, according to testimonies collected by AFP, have attempted to control the forced man.
I've seen a guy in his 30s with a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They didn’t get there because the guy was costly, Alberto, the server of a nearby bar, reported.
A crowd fell on him, including a municipal policeman who broke his wrist, he added.
Already Boulevard Jean-Jaurès, at the height of No. 61, two municipal police officers, including their officers, tried to intercept the gunman and were wounded by a fist, according to police sources.
The events took place in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many shops.
Passengers came to tell me there was a person injured outside.
I came out, I saw a 70-year-old on the ground, I put him in a safe position, and I noticed a very important wound to the abdomen, Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person, aged about thirty, was injured by a knife.
These are national police officers who have arrested the man who had no identity papers.
The Nanterre prosecutor's office seized the judicial police department of Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92) from the investigation.
The detainee was hospitalized on Thursday night.
He had not yet been heard as part of his watch.
A police source did not rule out his being admitted to a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six police officers to take him to the police station in Clichy, where he was taken.
He was "in a state of overexcitation" as "all the forces of this species whose forces unfold under the effect of action."
USA: Polanski’s lawyer demands renounced prosecution
French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski on Thursday demanded again in Los Angeles (California, western U.S.) that he abandon prosecutions against his client, currently assigned to reside in Switzerland for a 30-year-old mobster case.
Chad Hummel, the director's lawyer for the "Pianist", denounced in front of three courts of the Second District Court of Appeal of California serious misconduct at the time of the events, in 1977.
I demand the resignation of the charges here and now, Mr. Hummel said, adding that the behavior of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "was getting cold in the back."
According to him, Judge Rittenband -- who has died since -- would have discussed, before rendering his sentence, with a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved jail time -- which constitutes a serious misconduct.
This discussion had been revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired" (Roman Polanski, sought and desired), from the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells had finally stated in late September that he had "lied" to the author of the documentary.
In the event that the court refused to abandon the proceedings, Mr. Hummel demanded that a trial be held, which would allow him to present the evidence of his argument.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the argument already developed in the first instance, namely that no abandonment of charges could be seriously investigated until Roman Polanski appeared before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978, before his sentence was pronounced, for "illegal sexual intercourse" with a 13-year-old girl.
He hasn’t put his feet in the United States ever since.
Los Angeles County Deputy Prosecutor Phyllis Asayama said Roman Polanski “must be there to present himself to the audience.”
In this case, do we want to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that it is possible to escape?", asked Asayama.
For her, the filmmaker "requests a favor from the court, while despicing his authority".
One of the three judges — who now have 90 days to make their decision — also stressed that “there are other alternatives to escape.”
Mr. Hummel was not the only one to ask for the renouncement of prosecutions against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, also demanded, once again, the end of the prosecution.
Recalling that her client no longer tolerates being harassed at every turn of the Polanski case, she added: "Nobody in this room can say that the procedure has been fair.
Thirty-two years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on September 26 on a U.S. arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was assigned to reside in his cottage in Gstaad, awaiting a possible extradition.
Wall Street ends without direction, slowed by dollar rise
The New York Stock Exchange ended without direction on Friday, in a tight market between better-than-expected indicators in the U.S. and the dollar’s rise: the Dow Jones won 0.63% but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the technologically dominant Nasdaq dropped 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index increased from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver, from Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in narrow margins, the volume of trade has become very low and I think this will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the publication of better-than-expected economic indicators, which "contributed to improving market opinion on the solidity of economic recovery," Charles Schwab's analysts summarized.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November for the second consecutive month and much more than expected.
U.S. consumer confidence also sharply improved in December, at 73.4 against 67.4 in the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indices have been slowed down by a further increase in the dollar, at a two-month high against the euro, which “pusses down sectors sensitive to the economic situation,” explained Owen Fitzpatrick, of Deutsche Bank.
Technological values have thus lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bond increased to 3.540% against 3.482% on Wednesday night and that of the 30-year bond to 4.497% against 4.492% on the eve.
The election of Miss World once again in South Africa
After a month of travelling across South Africa, the 112 Miss Monde candidates are preparing to cross the last straight line on Saturday to realize their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
During this great fair of beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already won their ticket for the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma of Canada have been selected Miss sportive or Miss top model during their African stay.
It was a real turbulence.
Visiting beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town was extraordinary.
I’ve seen a lot of things and experienced so many experiences!”, exclaims Miss Sierra Leone.
The competition, which will be held for the ninth time in South Africa, will be broadcast live on Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, starting at 17H00 (15H00 GMT).
I couldn't dream of a better country to put my crown back.
This experience was fascinating.
I am happy to have lived it twice, emphasizes Miss Monde Ksenia Sukhinova in the warmth of the southern summer.
For the young Russian woman, her second stay in South Africa was marked by many exchanges with the candidates and the rediscovery of "breathing landscapes in this country".
After a month of gala, rehearsals, press meetings and safari, the Miss are now focusing on the competition.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000 and present to this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both of whom became Bollywood stars.
It’s the dream of every woman to be crowned the most beautiful in the world, but it’s not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries and I want to go home with the crown, she launches Miss India with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will score this 59th edition.
The candidates will wear a traditional costume and of course a swimsuit.
The show will be animated by television presenter Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and Miss Monde committee manager Steve Douglas.
“South Africa has shown that it knows how to welcome the world with warmth and pride that it is hard to match,” said Julia Morley, president of Miss Monde.
Candidates like last year did a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bike, and tasted local cuisine.
Exceptionally, they also met South African President Jacob Zuma who tightened their hands.
Not common for a head of state, notes Miss Sierra Leone.
Their most beautiful memory will probably remain the draw in Cape Town (southwest) for the June 2010 World Cup, a way for the country to promote the event a little more.
I've met people I never thought I'd be able to approach.
I’m definitely going to be back for the 2010 World Cup, enthusiastically Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday’s news is “very positive,” according to his son David
Johnny Hallyday’s news is “very positive,” his son David said on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles Airport where he was due to head to his father’s bed hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
It’s very strong, it’s going very well, David Hallyday told the press when he left the plane that took him from Paris shortly after 13:00 local time (21:00 GMT).
The singer's son, who seemed to be relaxed, said he was going "very quickly" to Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for a consecutive infection following a disc surgery on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was “placed in artificial coma this night in Los Angeles for a reason of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and to be able to administer his treatment,” the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in artificial coma by doctors at the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where he had been admitted Monday for a consecutive infection following the operation of a discal hernia on November 26 in Paris.
The singer had to be reopened in the evening of Wednesday to Thursday due to major injuries resulting from this intervention.
His wife, Laeticia, went to French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning, where her daughter Jade is schooled, to attend a school show, an AFP photographer said.
The head of orthopedic and traumatic surgery at the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he will visit the singer on Monday in Los Angeles.
The producer violently questioned Dr Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated the singer on November 26 at the Monceau International Clinic in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were outcasts, Camus said.
“I’ve heard about a possible judicial process coming,” he said.
Jean-Claude Camus felt that Johnny Hallyday had “departed too quickly for Los Angeles, with the permission of the Parisian surgeon.”
I had this doctor in person online who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and it surprised me, since I myself had two disc hernias, he added.
Shortly before on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently "going without drain, nothing," after his Paris operation.
Dr Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
He had operated on the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he was practicing at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorb a hematoma following a brain haemorrhage.
But he is also a reputable sulphur doctor, repeatedly convicted by the courts, in medically responsible records, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, the lawyer of the Order of the Doctors, accused him of being "a scrupulous man" who was "regularly" prosecuted before the Council of the Order, and who is "far from being recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
The latter indicated that the intervention was "perfectly well-developed" and that the postoperative examinations were "normal".
The operation "was not hemorrhagic and therefore did not require the laying of a drain," he added.
In any case, the singer’s tour, whose health problems have multiplied since this summer, seems to be in parentheses.
Obviously, a resumption of the tour on January 8 (at Amiens, NDLR) as planned, it seems very short, Camus said.
The UDF Association raises the tone and sums the New Centre to no longer use its logo
The UDF association, controlled by François Bayrou’s MoDem, reacted on Friday to the OPA’s attempt by the president of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, in the name of the former Giscardini party, putting it on hold to no longer use it on any support, under penalty of prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to retrieve the UDF logo, saying that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political legacy after stretching his left hand.
The defense minister, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had also planned to confirm this strategy before the National Council of the NC on Saturday.
To support his approach, he received the support of MEP Hervé de Charette (ex-UMP passed to the NC) who claimed ownership of the UDF brand for being the first to deposit it in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But on Friday evening, the office of the association UDF, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou who do not want to be deposed, came out of his silence to launch a detention to the minister and the deputy, summoning them to no longer use the logo and to hand over the property to the judges.
You have multiplied, in recent days, the statements that you would propose to your political movement of <0x2B>retake<0x2B> the UDF logo, wrote the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the bureau, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez du MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis' centA.
You also thought it good to keep track of the name of this movement, the <0x2B>New Centre<0x2B>, the slogan <0x2B> Today's UDF<0x2B>, on your active material and on your website's guard page, also note the signatories of the mail.
As you do not know, you have no right to use this logo, explains the UDF office, which urges the NC to "immediately remove the mention of the name of the UDF of any media as well as from (his) website".
He also asks Hervé de Charette "to pass on the ownership of (the) mark to its legitimate owners".
If you do not, the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, warn the signatories.
In their letter, they clarify that the UDF "is a full-fledged political movement since 1978" and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends had "made the choice" to leave it in 2007 "to create a competing movement, as others did in 2002, to create the UMP."
According to them, the New Centre has no right to use the UDF (Union pour la démocratie française).
They also recall that the last UDF congress voted in 2007 to join the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office in charge of defending "the material and moral interests" of the training founded by Valery Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when he filed the mark", he was "no longer a member of the UDF for three years", but to the UMP.
He uses scandalously and fraudulently the absence of the acronym UDF to do so on his behalf.
This indelicacy is turning into a crime, they denounce, before ironizing the strategy of the NC: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name for itself than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which one is not entitled."
Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
The Nanterre court on Friday decided to judge the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt accuses him of, he took advantage of a state of weakness of the octogenaire to spoil a part of his fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photos, will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum of three years in prison and a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>375,000.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of France's richest families, in which mother and daughter broke up while holding the reins of the cosmetics empire L'Oréal.
But the 15th correctional chamber also ordered that a medical expertise of Liliane Bettencourt, 87, should be conducted collegiately by three doctors.
The heir and principal shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to submit to such an examination, at least not under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Attorney General during the investigation.
The doctors appointed on Friday will have to submit a report by March 10, 2010, indicating in particular whether Liliane Bettencourt was in a state of weakness and at what periods.
I think she'll submit to it.
I'm going to talk to him about it," Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, told the audience.
For his part, Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers’ lawyer, Me Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court’s decision.
This is excellent news (...) Expertise will show that he (Mr. Banier) manipulated this old lady that we need to protect, he said.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt’s single daughter has filed a criminal prosecution against François-Marie Banier, photographer and touch-to-all artist, who she accuses of taking advantage of her mother’s weakness for years in order to obtain a billion-dollar allowance or donations.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt has always denied having been manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers a long-time friend.
While the court had to examine the admissibility of the action undertaken by Ms Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers’ appeals sometimes turned to the great family outcry on Friday.
Liliane Bettencourt’s lawyer reported three letters sent by her client (in 1999, 2003, and 2005) to her notary, in which she said she was neglecting the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In a letter dated 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: “Could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for fifteen years?
“François, I have never been able to talk to him since his marriage.”
For its part, the Nanterre Attorney-General once again considered that the complainant was unacceptable to act, especially as a guardian judge has refused in recent days to make her request to open a judicial protection procedure for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to act in justice, she is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in his place,” said public ministry spokeswoman Marie-Chrsite Daubigny.
The court finally decided that it would decide once the trial took place on the admissibility of Ms Bettencourt-Meyers.
Management Revolution or the End of Economic Intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of the major French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence would have been futile...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies towards its employees reminds us of the position of the companies towards consumers before the marketing revolution: it is to make employees adhere to certain "values" from above, as it was used by the technicians to impose on consumers.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, the marketing revolution has put the strategies of conquering the markets in place... although the authoritarian temptation to impose disconnected products from customer preference factors regularly comes back!
Employee demobilization can lead to deadly demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the emerging part of a much more general phenomenon that affects managers in particular.
This demobilization seriously undermines the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, including R&D and, moreover, economic intelligence.
Indeed, the IE "requires from all stakeholders (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision"; it requires on the part of employees a commitment that authoritarian management revenues totally contradict.
That is why we call for a managerial revolution that would be to put employees at the center of the company’s concerns in the same way as the customer.
The Relative Use of Internal Opinion Surveys
Will internal opinion polls – such as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its employees – incite this revolution in managerial practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
- First of all, because I have been able to find that, in the face of a new situation, any structure finally arrives, after many deviations, to do priority... what she has always done.
- Then, because authoritarianism – one of the pathologies of power – grows in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
Finally, because most leaders have a simplistic view of human behavior.
From the great schools of engineers, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, by intellectual comfort, the old behaviorist theory, recently reactivated by the "neurosciences" of the United States and widely disseminated, unknowingly, by the institutes of study and the media.
Thus, suggesting that it is possible to handle the "leverages" (sic) of manager engagement, a recent survey of Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr comforts leaders in a mechanistic, unsuitable position of governance in today's world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the management revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises requires a finalist vision of human behavior.
It consists in integrating, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental conclusion: for employees, engagement with the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a way to realize part of their dreams, ambitions, and projects.
Currently, only studies from the Motion-Functional Analysis adopt this concept of employee motivations.
These studies have shown that they judge their company based on a predetermined doxa that allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to realize their life plans.
Through the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, business leaders can control, anticipate and anticipate their "social performance" and put their human resources management "in place".
They thus create a ground for the concerted development of a robust and effective economic intelligence.
Oslo’s speech: ‘just war’ deserves praise to Obama’s right hand
The U.S. right-wing party welcomed Oslo’s speech on Friday, pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize had defended the concept of “just war” against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who had scoffed at the award to Mr. Obama on October 9, applauded the presidential speech this time, like Sarah Palin, a former vice presidential candidate in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, said Palin, a right-wing member of the Republican Party, to the USA Today newspaper, adding that she had herself addressed the theme of the war "sometimes necessary" in her recently published memoirs.
War is, of course, the last thing that Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to arrest these terrorists all over there, she said.
Obama, who inherited the two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, on Thursday used Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Obama’s other opponent, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done a “very good job” in Oslo.
I found the speech to be really good, congratulated the former President of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential speech.
On some sides, I found this all-around historic speech, said Mr. Gingrich, who was interviewed during the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former presidential candidate, considered by some to be a possible candidate for the Republican presidential election in 2012, said he was pleased to see “a left-wing president” reminding members of the Nobel Committee “that they would not be free and would not be able to give back a prize of peace if they did not resort to force.”
For Michael Gerson, former George W. Bush’s pen reconverted chronicler in the Washington Post, Mr. Obama said “a very American speech.”
In addition to presenting himself as a “citizen of the world” as “he always does,” “he spoke like a U.S. president,” reminding Europeans “that they live in a security bubble that they have not created and that they do not do much to preserve it,” Gerson said.
Among the few on the right not to be convinced, a Bush-era faucon, former UN ambassador John Bolton, called the speech "terrible, blurred and without inspiration" on the National Review Online website.
On the left of the president, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When war is enveloped in the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocents, he warned.
The center-left press, however, remained commendable to the president's place.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to think that the Nobel Prize was awarded prematurely to Mr. Obama, called his speech "superproduction" even for a speaker known for his talent.
Oslo’s speech “should serve as a roadmap to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression,” the California daily said.
Obama "pronounced the speech that was necessary," the New York Times said, deeming him "both dark and uplifting."
Routers: three marathons for a deal that saves Christmas supplies
After three marathon negotiation sessions, the road trade unions and TLF, the only employers’ organization to be left behind, reached an agreement on Friday evening that put an end to the strike order and the heavy threat to Christmas supplies.
At the signing session on Friday evening, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "rejoined" the agreement, after several negotiations, which began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators had left early on Friday morning, hoping to sign the agreement early in the morning.
And even if three employer organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had knocked on the door.
But it took even more than six hours for a meeting to begin at 11 a.m. for everyone to agree and the text to be signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "would have been very damaging to businesses" and "he was afraid that it would disrupt the holidays at the end of the year," Bussereau said.
The text provides for a 4% increase in salaries for the lowest salaries (in local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
In the hourly rate, for low wages, "we're moving from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It’s not a big deal, but we’re going very far,” said Patrice Clos (FO).
Either we're going to give our militants the order that there are no blockades, no blockades of refueling centers.
But we can still have some recalcitrants that are not satisfied, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, praised "a good deal", even though it has been "difficult to grant increases on high wages in the face of international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
This is the agreement of common sense and respect for employees, Maxime Dumont (CFDT) said, while Thierry Douine (CFTC) praised "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) referred to him as "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for a revaluation of travel costs of 3%, and a general state of affairs of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will include addressing the issue of a 13th month and a modernization of the collective agreement.
Mr Bussereau recalled that "a decrease of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million in employer charges" was the subject of a government amendment to the draft amendment to the Finance Act for 2009, which was voted on the night of Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote on it "in identical terms".
The signing of TLF allows the agreement to be applied in the first place to companies that are members of this organisation, and in the second time, to the whole profession, in case of extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will be done “as soon as possible,” said Mr. Bussereau.
The opposition of employers can only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a "dump market" as the 100 million euros "were already promised to the sector to offset some of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport has forced us to negotiate in an emergency, not in the conclusion of a shared analysis, but in order not to upset the turkey eaters of the next awakening, the Unostra regretted.
For the OTHER, the agreement risks "burning the grave of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months".
RER A: disturbances this weekend, unions dissatisfied with RATP proposals
The disturbances on RER A, France’s largest urban public transport line, will continue over the weekend, while a meeting Friday on the 2nd day of strike between trade unions and RATP management left them hungry for their claim for premiums.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important shopping weekend before Christmas, there will be trains only between 10H00 and 20H00, due to one train out of two on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one train out of four outside the central section.
The interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, which will force travellers to change trains.
The Lafayette Galeries, which await 200,000 customers each day, are delighted that "RATP is making efforts to serve the big stores".
The RER A crosses from the west is the Parisian agglomeration.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains ran at peak hours, and almost no copper in hollow hours, as expected.
As of Thursday, there was no cohue on the quays, the French being organized.
Thus, early in the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less frequented than usual, especially due to the absence of college and high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he had got up “30 hours earlier, to be sure to arrive on time.”
The Saint-Lazare station did not experience saturation, the SNCF said, which had provided for the deployment of police and police officers.
The RER A operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare station to reach the metro.
New general gatherings of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results, judged "small" by trade unions, of a meeting with the management on Friday afternoon.
The RER Director proposes negotiating a protocol specific to RER A on all aspects, working time, career development, etc.
This is not what drivers want, who demand a due premium, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even puts its premium proposals between parentheses, the CGT was indignant, stressing that the management "wasn't failing to solve a problem while the roadmakers and the SNCF did."
A new meeting is scheduled Monday for "a wider review of the conditions of exercise of the profession," the RATP said.
That also told the unions that the company was “smiling at weekend users.”
In the morning, about 150 drivers had invaded an establishment committee at the headquarters in Paris.
It was then that the management, who until then refused any discussion during the strike, had suggested the meeting "in a calming concern".
The conflict threatens to expand at RER B on Tuesday, after a notice was filed by Unsa and Independents.
Trade unions demand a premium of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>120 (UNA) to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150, including <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independents) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this line to a million daily travelers.
RER drivers, all in the second part of their career, receive between 2,200 and 2,700 euros gross as well as between 600 and 650 euros of premiums, for shifted hours, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves pro-Kurdish party, heavy decision of consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court ruled on Friday the dissolution of the country’s main pro-Kurdish party, a decision which was immediately followed by protests in the Kurdish community, in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the task of the government, which has just reached out to the Kurdish community in an attempt to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was disbanded as it had become a “home of activities detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unit,” said the president of the Court, Hasim Kiliç, after four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously by the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes was required to pronounce the dissolution, Kilic said, adding that 37 of the party’s cadres, including its president Ahmet Türk and deputy Aysel Tugluk, were banned from political life for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity to Mr. Türk and Mrs. Tugluk and the confiscation by the Treasury of the Party's property.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that MPs would leave Parliament rather than sit as unlabeled MPs.
The decision follows a procedure initiated in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accuses the DTP of obeying the “directions” of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party, however, says it has "no organic ties" with the PKK but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The Court’s ruling comes as the government has just reached out to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights, to try to thwart Kurdish support for the PKK and end the conflict.
DTP leaders had claimed that a dissolution could lead to a rise in tensions in southeastern Anatolia, where many protests against the detention conditions of PKK leader Abdullah <0xC3><0x96>calan have degenerated in clashes with police in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, a thousand protesters have gathered in front of the DTP’s premises in Diyarbakir, the large city in the southeast most populous Kurds.
Police fired tear gas grenades and used water cannons, while protesters were throwing molotov cocktails or stones, with spears.
Hundreds of people also protested in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr Türk said the court’s decision would “profundize despair”.
Turkey cannot solve this issue (Kurdish, ndlr) by banning a party, he told the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
We are in principle opposed to the closure of parties.
This does not solve anything, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said.
This decision is a complete torpedoing of the government’s democratic opening, political analyst Ahmet Insel commented.
Obviously, we can expect a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the deadliest in recent months.
The first snow can fall
What Wolfgang Brauburger wants is a very rigorous winter.
But the head of the road clearing and sanding service (FES) says it is not to disturb citizens.
It is simply so that agents can test the technique of vehicles and learn how to properly control them.
And according to the meteorologist, this could be for this weekend.
More than 300 agents and 120 vehicles stand ready to attack snow and glacier.
The ESF follows a very elaborate plan here.
Mr. Brauburger explains that as soon as he starts snowing on the city of Frankfurt and temperatures drop below zero, large sanding vehicles run 20 main routes (called A routes).
This includes high-speed streets, main roads, such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
Also included are fire access, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sloping streets such as Atzelbergstraße.
FES officers begin service at three in the morning.
If necessary, the 1040 kilometres of road must be salted with a road foundation that adheres well, in a maximum of 3 hours.
This is why the FES service starts at 3 a.m. "so that roads are cleared when daily migration traffic starts".
Or it gets harder, it’s when the snow falls at 7:30 a.m.
This poses problems, says the head of the road sanding and unwinding service "because no motorist is willing to let the dirty vehicles pass".
Then, if it snows no longer, we take care of access roads and dessert roads - such as the Rat-Beil-Straße.
Secondary roads and side streets come last.
Mr Brauburger knows that this always causes some complaints.
At five o’clock in the morning, the FES pedestrian team sets out to prioritize areas and passages deemed dangerous.
As for cycling trails, the ESF services are generally unable to deal with them.
Mr. Brauburger pointed out that there is a special service in Frankfurt that monitors the condition of the bridges between 10 p.m. and 4:30 p.m.
As the glaze forms very quickly on these surfaces, sail vehicles intervene as soon as the temperature drops below 2 degrees.
It is also possible for the police to use this special service when there is a need.
The cradle of dinosaurs
The Tawa hallae resembled the other carnivore dinosaurs: this bipedal was about 2 meters long by 1.50m high, its rear limbs were powerful, its elongated skull had sharp and curved teeth, its short arms ended with clawed claws, and it had a lounge.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have had nothing exceptional.
But, as Sertling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin and his colleagues report in Thursday's Science magazine, the Tawa hallae is one of the first dinosaurs to have these morphological characteristics.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which was then part of the emerging lands of the supercontinent, the Pangaea, and was in the direction of the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt says that the discovery of the Tawa enlightens a new day the evolution of the first dinosaurs.
In fact, it informs us about the relationships, the distribution and the characteristics of the latter.
It was in 2006 that Sertling Nesbitt undertook excavations with other paleontologists on the Gohst Ranch site in northern New Mexico.
Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History and member of the excavation team tells us that sometimes they find a dozen bones in a day, which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary layer dating from the Trias.
Scientists quickly realized that some of these bones belonged to a new species.
The excavations updated the remains of five specimens.
A discovery that confirms the theories about the beginnings of dinosaur evolution.
The researchers named him Tawa after the word of the Indians Hopi for the sun god.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an exceptional discovery: dinosaur fossils from the Trias are extremely rare and limited to a few incomplete bone fragments.
Not all experts in paleontology share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn does not find this discovery to be particularly spectacular, but he notes that it confirms certain theories concerning the beginnings of dinosaur evolution.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth about 230 million years ago.
Most of the oldest fossils, however, are fragmented and incomplete, which makes it very difficult to classify all the first dinosaurs.
Experts wonder, among other things, at what time the Saurians were divided into three major evolutionary groups: the theropods (carnivores) which comprise the tyrannosaurus and the velociraptor that appeared later and whose descendants the birds, the sauropods, the quadrupeds of which the snips are long-necked, and those whose parts are the aparigots and theirs.
According to studies by S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa is one of the first theeropods.
This species presents an interesting report of both primitive and developed characteristics, says S. Nesbitt.
The researchers found clues that suggest that the Tawa hallae had small airbags in its bones at the skull level, just like the birds that are descendants of the theropods.
These small air pockets make it easier for birds to breathe compared to mammals.
It seems that in the Tawa hallae, the vertebrae were also partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, the Tawa is one of the oldest theeropods with small air bags in its bones.
Since the related lineage of huge sauropods also had airbags and a light bone, it can be thought that their common ancestor already had this beneficial innovation.
Three consecutive waves of migration to North America.
As the most primitive dinosaurs known lived in South America, researchers concluded that the Saurians had appeared there.
Therefore, the three major lines of evolution were divided and spread from South America to the rest of the world, that is, all the emerging lands that formed the Pangaean supercontinent.
This appears to be confirmed by the fact that the team of paleontologists also discovered the remains of two other theropods that are not particularly related to it.
The three species cannot descend from a common ancestor who would have migrated, the researchers say.
Alan Turner of the New York Museum of Natural History and co-author of Science Studies magazine says there would have been at least three waves of migration to North America.
There are, of course, some contradictions.
Martin Sander, a paleontologist in Bonn, says that there is an even older species, the silesaurus, that lived in present-day Poland and belongs to a group related to dinosaurs.
According to him, this could give a wrong view because there are a large number of dinosaur fossils in South America that have been preserved while practically none are found on other continents.
On the other hand, how the dinosaurs managed to become the dominant tetrapods of the secondary age as they came from a relatively rare sideline of the reptiles branch remains a mystery to this day.
At the time of the Trias, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as with the ancestors of the current crocodiles and with many other Saurians.
By the end of the Trias, dinosaurs spread across the planet, thus promoting the development of many new species, while others, who were related to them, disappeared between the Trias and the Jurassic.
Such a success, however, is not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two hypotheses.
There could have been a massive extinction at which the dinosaurs survived randomly while other reptiles had disappeared.
Or, at the time, dinosaurs were better suited and thus they were able to eliminate competition on the ground.
In any case, such a success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a meteorite favored the development of a group of animals that had also developed during the Trias and that since then was vegetated in the shadow: it was mammals.
The Solidarity of Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories from all over the world.
There are those of professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
There are courses from the University of Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police evacuation of the J.W. Goethe University’s casino in Frankfurt makes waves all over the planet.
278 professors and teachers from J.W. Goethe University, as well as other higher education institutions in Germany, Europe and North and South America, express their solidarity with the Westend Campus students.
In a statement in German and English, they condone the police intervention demanded by the University's Steering Committee.
Last week, University President Werner Müller-Estler had evacuated buildings occupied by students and teachers on strike after walls and artworks were barbed with graffiti.
Five students were injured during the evacuation.
The signatories believe that the degradation did not justify "a violent intervention on the part of the police command against students and teachers who had organized their own courses".
Evacuation represents an "unacceptable violation" of freedom of research and education.
Focusing exclusively on acts of vandalism serves only to "delegitimize and criminalize the protest" and attempts to forget the reasons for the mobilization.
The University's Steering Committee thus abstained from debates that would still be essential.
Courses require that the criminal prosecution initiated is immediately suspended.
The majority of occupants did not participate in the degradation.
Legitimation of Protests
The young people of the Verdi services union and the German Confederation of Trade Unions (DGB) show their solidarity with the students.
Protests are just a legitimate expression of growing concern for our own future, says Alexander Klein, regional youth secretary of the Verdi union.
As for the Minister of Land Sciences of Hesse, Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), she also took action undertaken by the President of the University and the police.
We thank the President of the University.
Any occupation and degradation of the places is totally unacceptable, she told the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament last Thursday during the TV show Aktuelle Stunde.
We understand the meaning of the protests but do not accept vandalism, CDU MEP Peter Beuth said.
The opposition SPD parliamentary groups, the Greens and the Left (left) did not share this opinion.
The CSU takes the pretext of a few painted walls to criminalize protests, said Janine Wissler of the Left party (Linke)
Instead of reflecting on the students’ arguments and claims, they are evacuated.
The Left Party has filed a motion that sums up the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on the conditions of police intervention.
The new “Silicon Valley”
For a long time it had the reputation of a secret city, forbidden to western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was, under the Soviet regime, a secret weapon search site, under strict surveillance.
Today, with its 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from the center of Moscow, the municipality has a reputation for being the Soviet “Silicon Valley”.
There are important production and research sites in micro and nanoelectronics.
Since September 2008, representatives of Zelenograd have established links with Riedberg, the site of the Frankfurt Sciences – with the academic institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were reciprocal meetings and last Wednesday the representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg ratified a “Protocol of close collaboration”.
The signatories were Moscow's deputy mayor Yuri Rosljak and the prefect Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz head of the project section for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of FIZ and SMEs, whose focus is scientific research, will go to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchanges
This is a lasting scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will allow FIZ companies to enter the expanding Russian market.
On the contrary, Russian scientific societies want to obtain contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of famous Soviet research institutes and companies.
It includes the Moscow Institute of Electrotechnology, the large firms Sitronics and Rossijskaja-Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist city" for arms research.
Zelenograd (literally translated “Green City”) takes its name from the wooded hills in the heart of which the research centers are located.
Project S21: a brake for Stuttgart
The scope of the Stuttgart 21 project cannot be placed high enough.
For its supporters, it is nothing less than a “new heart of Europe”.
S21 is much more than the burial of a railway station, more than a colossal construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital Baden-Württemberg, into a desperate chaos of construction sites for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born in the spirit of the 80s.
Line head stations, with tracks ending in the city, had a reputation at the time to be the relics of the 19th century transport technology that made the brake sabot effect of modern railway traffic as it once took a lot of time to pass the locomotives from the rear to the rear.
Arrival, short stop, departure – that’s what you have to do.
That’s why line-head stations have to disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And also in Stuttgart: a train station, which is located about halfway on the Trans-European Railway Magistrale between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava from which the slogan "the heart of Europe".
The realisation of the S21 project will really begin, although the visions of the 1980s have long been not compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners acknowledged that the cost of burying the station in the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavaria was exorbitant.
In fact, headline stations do not really pose entry and exit problems anymore since there are modern, reversible trains with motorways and driver car at both ends.
However, the completion of Stuttgart 21 is now being launched alongside the new route of the inter-city line to Ulm.
Regional and municipal policies have taken it.
The railway company is on the side because it is the taxpayer who carries the risk of the largest infrastructure project in the federal republic and not the public enterprise.
From an urban point of view, this project is relatively well justified.
We get an urban space that – if you believe in the graphics of computer-generated planners – will be very green.
For the rail transport system, the S21 is bad.
The crossing station and the expansion of the section are designed for a trafficking of people that was attributed - and is typical of the 1980s - to tremendous growth.
At the time, there was no competition for cheap flights.
Modern traffic policy should first focus on strengthening freight traffic because rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than trucking on the road.
But the new track, with its slopes, is not suitable for freight trains.
The S21, which is much more serious, indirectly concerns many other railway projects.
For example, six billion euros will be allocated to the Souabe project.
That's the official number.
Experts believe that 10 to 15 billion are more realistic.
One thing is certain, in the next decade this money will be lacking for other points of junction and engorgement in the network.
The list of the Department of Transportation lists a total of sixty major projects.
One of the most important is the expansion of the section through the Rhine Valley by 180 good kilometres.
Since 1987 this line has been built slowly.
It would be really urgent to fully support the mushroom here.
But the S21 project has the effect of a brake shoe.
The route of the Rhine Valley is about to become the cornerstone of international freight traffic, right in the heart of Europe.
The government is reviewing the verdict on the airport
At the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament, the Land Government has mentioned the possibility of appealing the Hesse Administrative Tribunal's ruling on the prohibition of night air flights.
Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had commissioned experts to review the judgement of the Administrative Tribunal, which is a document of more than 400 pages.
The Kassel Tribunal had justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulation on the prohibition of night flight in the event that the construction of the north-west landing track at Frankfurt Airport would be carried out.
Authorization to land 17 aircraft between 23:00 and 5:00 in the morning, as envisaged by the Government of the Land, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against night airborne hazards.
The coalition must have decided by January 4 if it wants to file a case against the verdict rendered.
The opposition criticises this timeframe and attempts to pressure the representative of the Government to make a referral to the Federal Administrative Tribunal in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD parliamentary group Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise made before the election, which consisted of banning night flight, otherwise this will be conditioned as a total failure to speak.
It is sacredly difficult to be allowed to keep his word, Greens leader Tarek Al-Wazir said, referring to the FDP’s electoral slogan “We keep our promises.”
Minister Dieter Posch refutes the allegations of Schäfer-Gümbel, who claims that the Land government is still trying to authorize night-time flights using "avocation and robbery".
It takes time to carry out a specific legal review.
The coalition does not want to make a decision on the basis of a “first quick impression”.
The decision must be legally reliable, says Stefan Müller (FDP).
The interpretation of the opposition regarding the statements of its faction on the prohibition of night flight is completely wrong.
U.S. Banks Refund Allocated Aid
The big U.S. banks, very affected by the crisis, are draining from their ties to the state.
Bank of America announced on Wednesday that it had repaid <0x24>45 billion (more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 billion) in full to the Treasury, corresponding to the aid granted under the Tarp rescue plan.
CNBC said in a report that Citigroup was also considering reimbursing the aid received.
Banking institutions seek to get rid of the restrictions imposed, which accompanied the acceptance of sums, such as the limitation of bonuses allocated to managers as well as the higher fee settlement.
The Bank of Americaa launched a capital increase through the sale of securities to investors, which reported to it <0x24>19 billion in fresh cash.
The remainder of the sum comes from the bank’s cash registers which are well filled thanks to the sale of several branches from other sectors.
Last Wednesday evening, Kenneth Lewis, the Bank of America’s CEO, expressed his gratitude to American taxpayers: the injection of capital has helped significantly to overcome a difficult period.
The banking institution had assumed its capabilities by rescuing investment bank Merrill Lynch to the strongest of the financial turmoil.
Citigroup also plans to make money on the financial markets in order to free itself from state custody.
The U.S. bank could thus launch a <0x24>20 billion capital increase from Thursday, CNBC reported citing banking circles.
The spokesperson for Citigroup did not want to comment on this information.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repaid the public funds they had benefited from.
Accelerated Election
In the end, everything went faster than expected.
Almost two weeks after the resignation of the current editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender by the Board of Directors of the German ZDF chain, the successor has already been appointed.
The committee wanted to vote last night to carry out the nomination.
Peter Frey, who is the director of the Berlin-based ZDF, was the favorite.
However, the chain did not want to confirm the vote - officially - in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it seems that there has also been a willingness not to hurt the inspector of the ZDF Markus Schächter further in the event that the proposal would not be accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who is Schachter's candidate, needed the vote of 9 members of the Commission out of 14.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the end of the drafting of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had proposed to the Board of Directors to extend Nikolaus Brender's contract for five years, but this had been rejected.
Only seven members of the Council voted in favour of Brender's re-election and seven others voted against.
Indeed, the CDU, which is a majority on the Board of Directors, had already made it clear several weeks before the vote, did not want to resubmit Brender to his post.
It was Roland Koch, the Minister-President of the Land of Hesse who organized a league against the editor-in-chief.
He had refused to extend the contract of the highly esteemed editor-in-chief by invoking the fact that the ZDF’s information broadcast listening rate had fallen under Brender.
This is why the protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, stifling the growing political influence exerted on the ZDF.
At the end, there were even 35 public law experts who had interfered in the debate and believed Koch's way of acting was unconstitutional.
But that would have served nothing.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied political science, pedagogy and Romani languages (Spanish).
He then worked at Südwestfunk (Rhineland-Palatinate radio) and Frankfurter Rundschau (national German daily).
In 1983 he became an editor in the ZDF first in the news magazine "aujourd'hui-journal" (today's newspaper).
From 1988 to 1990 he was the deputy editor-in-chief of the period; then correspondent to Washington in 1991/1992, then and until 1998 he was head and presenter of the "Morgenmagazins" (bi-monthly information broadcast presented in the morning); then he was responsible for the policy until 2001.
After Brenner’s displeasure, when he was just elected journalist of the year by the specialised magazine Medium Magazine, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional complaint.
Koch's opponent on the board of directors, Rhineland-Palatinate Minister-President Kurt Beck, said last week that the Länder should transform the ZDF Intergovernmental Treaty so that the governor's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a party political majority.
However, Beck does not consider requesting the removal of political personalities from the ZDF's supervisory committees.
Peter Frey, the likely successor of Brender, had skillfully maneuvered with the Board of Directors by criticizing the commission vehemently in his decision to clear Brender.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose it for the position of editor-in-chief without losing his face, and the Board of Directors could elect it without suspecting him of placing a political supporter in the position.
In the arithmetic representations of the parties, Frey is ranked liberal on the left.
Great cleaning in university studies
Partial success for students: after a year of educational strike the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decide to show more conciliation: in a meeting between the Ministers and the delegates of the Rectors Conference, an agreement has been drawn up stipulating that the Master's degrees are the conditions of work.
In the future, students should be able to finish their studies.
In particular, they agreed to alleviate the weight of the exams: a single exam should allow the chosen study module to be closed.
In addition, the workload will need to be reconsidered to ensure "realistic and acceptable proportions".
Political authorities and higher education institutions wish to facilitate the recognition of exams between universities and abroad.
The Länder have also committed to organising more flexible common structural requirements for the bachelor’s and master’s branches.
At the regional level, there must be no different regulation from one country to another.
Less exams
Since the beginning of the student protests in June last year, Ministers of Education of the Länder and rectors of universities have consistently spoken the expression in fashion: "studyability".
But for the first time, this expression seems to take on a concrete meaning.
The accreditation board decided to considerably reduce the number of certain exams: "Each module should normally be able to be completed by a single exam", can be read in a 30-page document on future conditions for admission to university courses.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Board of Accreditation, said that by significantly reducing the burden of exams, we should be able to stop derailments, which were significantly detrimental to studyability.
In addition, "studyability" should be the decisive criterion for the organisation of studies in the future.
The modules as well as the background should be carefully examined to see if one can not avoid this feeling of suffocation that one sometimes feels in the choice of courses.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest RAID knowledge on Kunduz, the opposition believes Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate fraud.
Students should “have the opportunity and margin of maneuvering necessary to enable and promote personal initiative.”
The new regulation will concern access to new academic cycles but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles must be "recredited" every 5 years, which means, however, that it is only in 2015 that all cycles will be reviewed.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies across the federal territory that depend on accreditation boards established by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education had exerted some pressure on the Länder to weigh on the agencies so that the programmes were not overloaded and the review regime was not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and specialized higher schools have already consulted with their regional ministries to take appropriate action.
Rhine-Palatinate is so far the only country to have given its agreement to allocate more resources to the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organize tutorial programs to strengthen pedagogical guidance offices as well as exam offices and the International Relations Service
The Länder and universities have a budget of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million.
In early 2010, the government wanted to file an amendment to the Higher Education Act in Parliament.
As a result, only one exam will be required to complete its studies.
The organisation of studies will need to be more flexible, the ability to ensure the recognition of grades from other higher education institutions and access to the Master must be simplified.
By the end of next year, the "studyability" of all academic cycles will have to be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition again debated the question of the conditions of study in the country.
The decisions were appreciated, but criticisms were heard.
The Federal President of the Union of Socialist Students said he wished that the organization of educational policy would no longer take place in the future "behind the closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the educational strike, students as interested persons should be able to express themselves a bit.
The future graduates of higher education received the support of the President of the Conference of Rectors (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "The student experience is very useful to us," she said Thursday during a joint meeting with the Ministers of Education which reworked on the KHR project with the Länder.
For the Union of Education and Sciences (GEW) decisions made in Bonn do not go far enough. It demands the right and the opportunity for each graduate Bachelor to enroll in a Master's cycle.
Andreas Keller, member of the GEW Steering Committee, also requests that the Länder assure today’s Bachelor students that tomorrow there will be enough space for Master’s degrees and as good study conditions as possible.
The Länder therefore need to hire more instructors.
On the other hand, the Ministers of Education did not mention the possibility of facilitating access to the Master.
More than a note at the bottom of the page about Herta Müller
It is with these words "Arrival in Germany and it's beautiful, almost more control..." that begins a work of the poet Werner Söllner, in which he thematizes in whimsical phrases, the experiences of a dissident arriving in Germany who has gained freedom, but lost in time.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, was first a professor of German and English in Bucharest and subsequently a collector in a youth publishing house before moving to Frankfurt.
Söllner received various literary awards; in 1993 he held the highly coveted chair of poetry at the Goethe University of Frankfurt and since 2002 he has been the director of the Hesse Literature Forum at the Musonturm Artist House in Frankfurt.
He made a lot of talk about him in non-literary circles last Tuesday, at a congress in Munich, whose theme was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the mirror deforming your Securitate files".
Visibly unstable and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged in front of his fellow German-Roman writers such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer that he had collaborated as an informant for the political police of Securitate.
Söllner received the German Language Prize in 1989 jointly with some of the participants.
The enrollment trials had started insidiously in 1971.
I am, concludes Söllner, “so someone who hasn’t had enough to resist the intimidation attempts of the Securitate.”
The poet Werner Söllner is the informant Walter (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the awarding of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and her exemplary literary demeasures with the mechanisms of dictatorship power, the literary scene is shattered, and in particular the community of German authors originating in Romania, by a case that clearly shows on the political underground and underground system.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can tell from current knowledge, not only guilty but also a victim.
In his own Securitate file, IM Walter played a role, says literature specialist Michael Markel after Söllner’s confession and refers to the positive influence of IM Walter who had intervened in his favor.
“He could have pulled him out of all the difficult situations at the time,” according to Markel.
Markel felt the moral need to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and in front of this audience was unexpected, but the blindness of a former dissident of his collaboration with the Romanian secret services is not, in fact, so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for the Securitate spies had already written Herta Müller in July in the newspaper "Die Zeit", after reading the 914 pages of her own file.
It can be assumed that the victims would have speculated and sometimes guessed what real names were last hidden the names of Sorin, Voicu and also Walter borrowers.
Unlike Germany, where the consultation of the Stasi files is a reliable process in the meantime, the attitude towards the legacy of the Securitate files is still very confusing.
Systematic clarification has been constantly counterbalanced and braked in the past years.
It was only in 1999 that a national board corresponding to the Birthler institution was created to work on the assimilation of the Securitate archives (CNSAS), but the restitution of the files has rather drag since.
Since 2005, there has been a law that defines the management of archives.
The influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is confirmed by an interview with a former manager of the Securitate of Temesvar who, following the announcement of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, expressed himself in a very disrespectful way towards the laureate.
She had a psychosis, and in the end, she was only questioned once.
The infamy of power thought it could be expressed here, without any genes, under the cover of freedom of expression.
Of course, many of the inevitable questions are associated with the Söllner case as it happens so often in a context of hidden guilt.
The weighted reaction of the auditors, in the eyes of Söllner, leaves hope that the follow-up to this chapter will be more defined by a thirst for knowledge than by accusations and a feeling of shame.
On the Genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a note at the bottom of the page.
Category: Champions League riots
We had the impression that a representative was arriving there, shot with four pins coming straight from a nice Christmas party, on which the manufacturer of sports articles had stacked his goods when the new VFB coach Christian Gross climbed less than a quarter in a class C oven, he just came from his hand oranger.
The man, whose hot skull attracted attention, let himself drive into the city that was still alien to him.
Otherwise our fifty-year-old could have taken the steering wheel himself – he hadn’t drunk alcohol and he wasn’t drunk with happiness either.
He had had a nice evening, but tomorrow we had to get back to work.
Because now it was going to start.
The words of Switzerland that we had just engaged three days earlier were clear: "We have reached the eighth of the final", that is to say in the Champions League thanks to our 3-1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania "but we must not let ourselves be blinded by a rematch".
The “great work” awaits us on Sunday.
There, it is about repeating the results of the Champions League daily in Mainz.
And we will have to overcome the weaknesses that surfaced again after the three expeditional goals of Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.)
Shooting at luck
The eighth Champions League final (match go 16./17. <0x2B> 23./24 February/match return 9./10. <0x2B> 16./17. March) will take place on 18 December in Nyon.
The joy of the coming into fulminant function of Babbel's successor was therefore moderate.
And joy was not only moderate in the one who had brought luck, who had conveyed to the unstable professionals of Stuttgart a flawless motivation and the pleasure of playing.
I went to see the players and told them that they should focus on their assets, I advised them to be more courageous, explained the “soul-plowing” – Gross – the recipe for success that sounded so much that it didn’t make any more effects with the caregiver Babbel.
He triggered a certain magic, Jens Lehmann, a supporter of Babbel, admitted, “in football, when there is a new impulse, sometimes things happen that one would never have thought possible.”
And Sami Khedira, who, after weeks of break for injury, advances to the rank of the best player thanks to his dynamism, attempts to describe the “phenomena” observed by a proverbial “fresh wind” and the new boss’ working method: “It’s someone who passes to action and demands discipline.
That’s what we need in the current situation.”
But apparently Babbel had missed it.
VfB Stuttgart has not yet crossed the cap, warned manager Horst Heldt
At the moment, VfB Stuttgart especially needs tenacity.
Like Gross, the players and the manager are careful not to overestimate the victory against a completely outstripped and weakened defense of the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before having four days later a bad awakening in Leverkusen with a 0:4, objected Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, said they had achieved one of the goals of the season but had others that were still far away.
We haven't gone through the hard way yet.
That Heldt on his 40th birthday didn’t have the heart to celebrate, even after the first home win in three months, is from the weekend’s events that a television interview of goalkeeper Jens Lehmann made rebound just before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, would counter Heldt, in response to Lehmann's harsh criticism.
He accused the leadership of style weakness and said she had decided to change coach under pressure from puberty fans.
Lehmann had also judged as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy that his day off after the matches had been deleted.
Lehmann’s statements were “marked by pure egoism” and Heldt’s enthusiasm for the goalkeeper.
They no longer risked being friends for life with these two quadrennials.
In any case, they agreed with everything else, that is, without the previous work of the group by the replaced coach, strong sporting and combative performance would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were “for the most part successful” to return Heldt and Lehmann to the choir – and even the man with the plastic bag calmed down.
World Heavyweight Championships
Warm fight in Berne: Kevin Johnson the challenger constantly provoked the world champion Vitali Klitschko verbally and gesturefully.
But after twelve difficult rounds the Ukrainian defended his title as World Heavyweight Champion according to the WBC version.
With the unanimous approval of the judges, he took the points.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko retains his title as World Heavyweight Champion.
The WBC federation announced that on Saturday night the 38-year-old champion had won a points win by unanimous judges against American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time Klitschko has defended his title with honor since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian had already won the WBO and WBC World Champion title twice.
Unfortunately, he did not succeed in the long-awaited KO.
Klitschko, who won 39 times in 41 professional fights, has to admit twice his defeat due to injuries.
The challenger Johnson had to accept his first defeat in the 24th fight.
In the Arena of Berne, in front of 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko mainly wanted to dictate the fight, from the height of 2.02 meters, against his left.
Johnson, eleven centimeters smaller, who, before the duel, had announced the end of Klitschko's era, managed to avoid the champion's kicks, thus preventing Klitschko from getting into play against his dangerous right.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, tried most of all to pass the rounds.
Although he continued to provoke Klitschko in words and gestures, his shots rarely reached the champion.
He is the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in 2000, having exceeded the twelve-round distance with Klitschko.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the Swiss capital before the fight.
He insulted Klitschko, who treated him as a “zombie villain” who “is not really capable.”
During Friday's heavyweight, the champion couldn't stop provoking Johnson by dropping his sunglasses from his nose "so he could see his eyes".
Fourth victory since Klitschko's return.
Klitschko re-imposed in his fourth fight since his comeback on October 11, 2008
After a break of almost four years, he had beaten at the time the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered "his" WBC belt that he had previously had to give up without fighting.
This year, defending his championship, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola of the USA.
“I just took a shot in this fight and I’m in perfect shape,” Klitschko said to explain his quick return to the ring.
His dream is to try to bring together the four most important titles in the family.
His brother Wladimir is champion of the WBO and IBF federations.
But it is the British David Haye who, having dethroned the great Nikolai Walujew – 2.13 metres – in November, wears the WBA belt.
This summer, The Hague had canceled a match against Vitali Klitschko that was due to take place in September.
It would seem that his promotional company is planning to make this game play now at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Opposition frontal attack: The head of the Greens parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, accused Defense Minister Guttenberg of lying in the Kunduz case.
The SPD and the Left (left) parties ask the Chancellor for explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - After reviewing the latest information on the Kunduz air strike, the opposition accused Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) of deliberately hiding some facts.
The minister deliberately "formulated a counter-truth" on the murderous attack on two tanker trucks last September, the head of the Greens group, Jürgen Trittin, said on Saturday during the information broadcast of the ARD chain "Tagesschau" (the 20h newspaper).
Clearly, that means he lied.
The killing order was given in total contempt of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is, in essence, the content of the report that NATO has and that was read by Mr Guttenberg, Trittin said.
Last Friday, according to new media revelations, the target of the raid was actually not to destroy stolen trucks, but rather to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO inquiry report, 142 people were killed or injured in the U.S. air strike that was launched at the request of German Colonel Goerg Klein, military commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left on Saturday asked Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak to the Federal Parliament as soon as possible and to reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his Greens party colleague Renate Künast are of the opinion that Ms Angela Merkel must clearly say whether the targeted massacre strategy is part of the Afghan federal government's policy if the chancellor, the army and the intelligence services have approved this new stratagem.
The Government’s spokesman categorically rejects these criticisms.
The chancellor has in no way influenced military interventions in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, more and more voices were voiced to express doubts about the true reasons for the resignation of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as presented by the ministry.
According to the SPIEGEL newspaper, the information they had given Guttenberg about the tanker truck attack was both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have concealed the existence of the NATO report and concealed some disturbing details to the Minister.
However, the two senior officials are reported to have informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein and a report by the military police.
The Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung reported that Wichert had in the meantime asked for clarification in a letter.
So far, he hasn't gotten an answer
On Saturday, the Ministry refused to comment on these allegations and referred it to the Federal Parliament's inquiry committee, which was to be formed on Wednesday to shed light on the facts in question.
The Worlds of Dreams
Some see, all awake, images and hear voices that no one else sees or hears.
It is not only among the mentally ill, or under the influence of drugs, that the boundaries between imagination and reality are confused.
As long as these phenomena manifest during sleep, everything is fine.
When we lie down in our dark rooms, we can unhinder ourselves to the craziest dreams and fantasies.
However, the one who, awake, experiences the state of dream, hears and sees things that others do not perceive, quickly has the reputation in our Western world of being crazy or drugged, or at least of being an original.
Such images and voices do not appear only in the mentally ill or under the effect of the drug.
It is our imagination that is in question: it is the same neuronal activity that allows us to design houses, paint paintings, or write novels, but that sometimes induces the boundaries between dream, madness and reality to merge.
A state of conscious awakening, taking the form of a dream, can present itself in the most diverse forms, in the best of cases it is called visions, at the worst of madness.
But even if the trigger and the effect are different, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiments of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, the second states of the shamans, psychoses and hallucinations are attributable to very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or delusions when the balance, neurotransmitter substances in the brain - first of all dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and achetylcholine - breaks down and the interaction between the different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts occur very often during schizophrenic psychosis.
The force of terrestrial attraction no longer has power over the person.
Since ancient times, philosophers and doctors have always been thinking about the relationship between madness and dream.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of awakened dream; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, observed in 1861 "a great resemblance between madness and dream", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis with all the sensory irregularities, illusions and depolus.
We are in the fall of 2001 when Henning T becomes a cartoon character.
Her body is in two dimensions with crisp colors.
The earth's attraction no longer has power over it, it flies at the top of the ceiling.
He feels a blow.
Behind him are creatures of devilish, grim, bloody mouth, showing teeth.
They pursue him, give him footsteps with heavy flamboyant boots, throw him against the walls, he feels pain throughout the body.
Toning voices, evil, screaming, coming out of the walls and the radio.
He can no longer bear those voices that insult and humiliate him.
Henning T. removes two cables from his stereo chain, making it a loop and attaching it to a hook attached to the ceiling.
He climbs on a baffle and passes the loop around the neck.
He's jumping.
The loop is unlocked.
That this is a lesson for you, screaming the voices in a choir to tear the tympan out of him. "Go to a clinic and get yourself healed!"
Today, at age 40, Henning T. has experienced six acute psychoses, the last of two years, the first of soon 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
Diagnosis: schizophrenic-affective psychosis, paranoid, in addition to being maniaco-depressive, he takes medications against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
During the psychosis I experienced terrible fears and deep despair.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
Approximately one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in their lives; in psychiatric clinics it is the most common disease after depression.
In a schizophrenia crisis, people can no longer distinguish between the inner and outer worlds, they find themselves in a state of hyper-excitation, which makes them suffer from hallucinations, megalomania, relationship madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices – voices that command, comment, or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not uncommon either.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and the insignificant, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, the conscious is drowned under the sensations.
Like the dream, psychosis opens the door to a tide of ideas and fantasies from the deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the department of psychiatry of the Heidelberger CHU (Allgemeine Psychiatry im Universitätsklinikum).
The schizophrenia is at the heart of the situation, all with a meaning centered on it.
At the same time, he finds himself in a passive role, he is like a dream, overcome by events and cannot act on them actively.
This is why schizophrenia often feels threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general, they do not have the ability to adjust reality, the illusions are a cruel reality, waking up is excluded.
To experience once in his life a hallucination.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, “the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived during psychosis is fundamentally preserved.”
The delirium thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the living takes place in a real setting.
Why our brain makes this kind of cabriolet, is always a riddle for researchers.
Exceptional situations can cause everyone to lose momentarily the perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only decisive factors.
The researchers assume that the people involved have infinite brain injuries.
It is assumed that neuronal maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development, for example, by a mother's viral infection during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But what remains unexplained is the way the neuronal system abnormality occurs and, moreover, the fact that it does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or traumatic experience can be a trigger for psychosis, if there is a predisposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychoses because they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brain warms up.
What is crazy, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck, is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive medications to get rid of them while others buy very expensive drugs to get them.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a matter of perspective.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and illusory image phenomena for ten years: last year he published his findings in a book entitled "The Unreal World in Our Head".
Hallucinations are one of the typical concomitant phenomena of psychoses but also an impressive number of many other pathologies.
These include mental disorders such as borderline or depression as well as migraine, epilepsy, platelet sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or cranial trauma.
It is surprising to find that under certain conditions even the brain of healthy people is subject to hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They take shape when the areas of the brain that process sensory perceptions are hyperactive or not cooled enough; when our brain warms up, but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as brain injury or psychosis.
But also the lack of stimuli, stress, grief of love or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, one-third of participants admit to having experienced hallucinations at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in former Mecklenburg-Pomerania and goes to high school.
A little girl to be normal to say the truth.
If there were no pictures and voices.
During the recreation, it happens that a young boy, thin, with long caste hair, addresses the word to him.
When she answers, her comrades look at her, surprised – no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think that this shy young girl is a lunatic dreamer but Sarah K is not dreaming, she is sure of it.
She is awake, hears and sees this boy as she sees and hears the girl sitting next to her on the bench.
She can even perceive her presence momentarily.
It's a nice feeling, she finds this young nice.
“Am I crazy?” she asks sometimes.
But she knows well that this young man and the other visions are not real and will disappear again.
At night, the appearances are generally scary.
Visions are often heavy.
When she’s in class, she may not be able to follow the course because the teacher is just presenting a new student in her eyes and ears while he’s invisible to others and the teacher is visibly explaining equations in the table.
At night, the appearances are generally scary.
When, in the darkness of her room, she awaits the sleep that happens too rarely and too late, she often cannot make the distinction if she is awake or already dreaming, if the pictures she sees, the grim faces or the girl with bloodthirsty thighs on her arms or legs.
Leave me alone, she cries out to these creatures.
She doesn't talk about it to her parents or friends, they'd think she's crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She had her bacon last year and she lives with her friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she's been in contact with psychologist Kasten on the internet, she knows very well that she's not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or doesn’t have enough stimuli, the likelihood is that they will have hallucinations after a certain time.
I'm guessing that the brain isn't busy enough, so make sure there's animation.
Sarah K., a single daughter, was afraid of other children when she was little and often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13 that the man she called Dad, since she was old enough to think, was not her real father.
These are the same areas of the brain that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real impressions and sounds, so it is very difficult for people like Sarah K to differentiate between illusion and reality.
Hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real.”
For Kasten, nightmares are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those in acute psychoses.
Unlike schizophrenia, a mentally healthy person is able to recognize that ghosts are not real images.
This is why Kasten advises his patients to cherish hallucinations as a particular talent.
There is only one step between the dream and the hallucination.
In our world too focused on consciousness, there is unfortunately a rapid tendency to take imaginary experiences for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief physician at the psychiatric and psychotherapy clinic at Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a serious, painful disease but also contains something positive, of creator - madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the form of the so-called oniroid experiment, a particular form of consciousness modification awakened by dream.
Onyroid experiences are very complex semi-dreams that are perceived as real by the person who lives them and that he cannot differentiate from the dream even when he is awake.
The oniroid state of consciousness manifests itself during trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies as for patients with polyradiculopathy who are fully conscious, experience motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, he replaces this real situation that impairs his life, with his own imaginary world that is dissociated from reality.
It is a state of mental boundary between dreaming and hallucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change of world takes place but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
In fact, it is an intense form of means and interpretation, in an intolerable situation in itself, an organizational capacity which is given to us, men, in order not to obscure in the neatness of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in the memories.
The Zurich historian Peter Cornelius Classen also describes his oniroid experiences in his book "Change of Heart" as a soul-saving action.
He is 49 years old, at the time his conscious departs for a several-day trip after a heart valve surgery followed by a transplant; during this time, his body is sentenced to remain immobile in reanimation.
Claussen plunges into a world he has created from all coins, visits foreign places, travels in time. He sees himself as an old man in a railway sanatorium, a robot with his beard guarding his health.
He lives in the middle ages among the nobles who make blood-based narcotics.
He is kidnapped by a Greek motorbike who takes him to his country, he surfs with his hospital bed in the snowy Alps and meets a Korean mafia.
He absorbs himself completely into this imaginary world, everything is real even later in his memories.
According to Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a completely different state, he writes by describing what he has experienced.
Unlike dreams, memories from mental journeys are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
It can even be said that they are much more distinct and intense than real life.
The intensity of this experience blows the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, oniroid delusions, psychoses, hallucinations, and psychedelic experiences show us how fragile our inner representations of external reality are even in a state of alertness.
Any change in the state of consciousness, psychologist Kasten summarizes, "can cause a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be quite enriching.
The first snow can fall
Burda
At the age of 27, the children will take over the publishing house.
The appointment of Kallen as CEO of Burda is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda wants his two children to take over the press group, he told Spiegel.
Holding must remain 100% a family business.
Hamburg - In the long run, publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children
The two children will inherit at the age of 27 and are firmly determined to integrate the company, said 69-year-old Hubert Burda at Spiegel.
All the details have been settled in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will be raised later.
It will also be necessary to see if they are capable of doing so.
You can't impose your children on 7,500 employees without knowing if they have the capacity to take care of them.
This would destroy the children as well as the company.
Burda had announced last Thursday that he would resign as President-General as early as January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, has been a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
He was first and foremost responsible for the technology sector.
Later he took care of the Treasury sector i.e. he was responsible for the company’s capital and after Jürgen Todenhöfer’s departure he also took over the marketing, foreign sector, printing and finance.
So for the first time it is not a member of the family who is at the head of the Burda editions.
The children of Burda are 19 and 17 years old, respectively, his son Felix, who would have been 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
Kallen’s appointment also serves as a link for the next 10 or 15 years.”
Burda states that the holding must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
The ruins have always occurred in families that have let themselves be driven by capital bulimia, who have made huge unhappy speculations thinking they could climb ever higher.
This has never been my strategy.
I have never dreamed of universal power, said Burda.
I absolutely don't see myself as the country's predecessor as Springer could be and I don't intend to be part of these international leagues like Time, these companies have taken too much importance.
Full-fledged beauty
Everything you can desire, in terms of beauty and well-being, at your fingertips.
This is the goal that has been set by El Corte Inglés, which has just opened in the shopping center of Callao (Madrid), a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2, dedicated to care and care for the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, is home to prestigious marks such as Hedonai, specialist in laser hair removal, Spaxion, with its relaxation and aesthetic treatments, Luis & Tachi, hairdressers, Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its cosmetics.
There is also a feeding beam, with a tea salon in particular, which offers more than 130 different varieties.
Spaxion offers you, among other things, to enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner, while contemplating the exceptional views of the capital, or to rent for two hours the relaxation area to organize your own “Beauty Party” with eight of your friends and relax with a jacuzzi session, a bumping massage all while chumping.
In total, it is 250 m2 spread over 12 rooms, where you can benefit from the most innovative facial, body care and hydrotherapy.
For example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibrating platforms.
The gym also has these devices, as well as virtual “trainers” that guide the steps of the customers, offering them a fully customized treatment.
It all starts with the introduction of your personal code on a touchscreen, located in front of the device.
Several videos then show us how to properly perform our exercise program.
Its director ensures that 15 minutes (heating and stretching included) is enough to make all the muscles of the body work.
And, if after we have made our body work, we want to go through the hair salon, the sign Luis & Tachi has a room where we propose rituals of hair repair, brightness or nutrition, all customized.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the key words of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year from 10am to 10pm.
Various Decolletes
Christmas is approaching and it is never superfluous to study the look of the stars to adapt it to our party wardrobe.
The shape of the necklace, very important for highlighting the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must take into account.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated necklace. This is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, equipped with electric car
Endesa Electricity Company, in collaboration with the Barcelona City Council, has created the "Office LIVE".
This is a project aimed at developing and promoting the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The "Office LIVE" (Logistics for the Implantation of Electric Vehicles) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the deployment of electric cars in the city and implement mobility agreements, by conducting procedures, coordinating, presenting grants, etc.
In addition, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, gather the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Ultimately, the idea is to launch what will become the transport of the future.
3 “Electrical Cities”
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the deployment of electric cars in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are joining the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government, as part of the MOVELE Plan, to launch the implementation of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat de Catalunya.
It aims to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
The latter include activities related to energy, and in particular to energy efficiency.
Endesa is not the only initiative involved in the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in standardisation groups at European level and has a set of complementary projects such as the G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT GREEN underway.
Zapatero interviews “a future of tranquility” for the motor industry
Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero said he saw “a future of tranquility” for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the country’s main export sector.
In the presentation of the 2009 President’s Economic Report, Zapatero recalled the steps taken by the executive during the year to support the automotive sector.
“Without the Competitiveness Plan for the automotive sector, we would today have a landscape of abandonment, of closure of some of our major production sites,” the government said.
“Through this plan and the decision of the brands to remain in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can consider a future of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector,” he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Comprehensive Plan for the Automotive Sector (PIA), allocated <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 subsidiaries, which mobilised an investment of more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion.
The chief executive explained that this investment was aimed at both the development of new models and the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also focused on government measures to support demand, in reference to Plan 2000E, which was put in place in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive companies.
According to the President, this plan has reduced the average emissions of new vehicles marketed in the Spanish market by 6% and has contributed to a “significant increase” in registrations, which increased by “40%” in November.
20,000 m2 of collection cars
Madrid hosts the first edition of the International Car Collection Fair, a meeting space for professionals and motor enthusiasts.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Cristal Pavilion of the Casa de Campo de Madrid.
It has an exhibition area of 20,000 m2, where more than 200 national and international exhibitors will be present.
Not only can you find motorcycles and collection cars there, but you will also find in ClassicAuto Madrid items of all kinds related to the world of the engine.
Thus, in the exhibitors of the pavilion, we will be able to find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, magazines, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the collection engine that will make collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies we will find, among others, Classicos de Mos and Good Old Times, auto sales specialists, Juan Lumbreras, restauration, Coupe-Francisco Pueche, auto sales and restoration, or Cochera Classicos, Mercedes Benz specialist.
External fitness test
But the commercial activity of this salon will also include parallel activities: gatherings, sports exhibitions, fitness tests, presentations and competitions.
Skill tests with motorcycles and collection motorcycles will also take place on a planned circuit outside the exhibition park.
Mazda3 i-Stop: A sustainable sporting spirit
Mazda wants to prove that the sporting spirit is not annoyed with respect for the environment.
For this purpose, it has just integrated on the Mazda3 the stop and start system of the engine, called i-Stop, a device which, at least for the moment, is only available on the 150 horsepower 2.0 engine.
This second generation of Mazda3 is illustrated by the good rating it has achieved as a whole.
Details, vehicle finish, habitability, behavior, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are remarkable on the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving position, it turns out that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and fastening.
The touch of the steering wheel is also particularly pleasant.
Continuing with the set formed by the dashboard and console, we see how Mazda continued in the Japanese trend of creating a futuristic interior design, with many buttons and controls, as well as bright colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic.
That is why we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more particularly with the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to surpass.
Continuing with the cabin, this compact Japanese car has more than enough habitability to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
In addition to all this, there is a large box with regular shapes.
The automatic shut-off and start system of the engine, at least for the moment, is only available on the two-liter and 150 hp petrol engine and with manual six-speed change.
This engine is a true happiness. It is illustrated by its subtlety, low noise, performance and control of its consumption.
Indeed, although the most sought after Mazda3s are diesel models, those who do not run a large number of kilometers per year should not exclude this i-Stop with gasoline engine, both for its high speed comfort and for its controlled consumption.
Regarding the level of equipment, the model chosen for the test is the Sportive, that is to say the one with the largest number of series elements.
Among the serial equipment, the route change assistant (RVM) which removes the dead angle, the traction and stability controls, the speed controller, the photosensitive interior mirror, the computer on a large screen, the lumilig pou, the parking sensors, the b'tookie, the air conditioning and the independent.
In addition, as if this equipment were not enough, this version had the Premium Pack which, for an additional <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,500, includes among other elements of adaptable bi-xenon headlights and a BOSE audio system with disc charger.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its category.
It is particularly illustrated by the quality of the materials used, its behaviour and its high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not run many kilometres per year will be able to opt for the i-Stop version associated with the gasoline engine 2.0 of 150 hp.
The only disadvantage of this model is its high price, which is between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>21,770 for the Luxury finish and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>23,270 for the tested model, the Sportive.
In return for this significant sum, the Mazda3 will offer us a large dose of satisfaction every day.
The “First” of Luxury
L.A. covers the red carpet of sensuality embodied by Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have more than ever blushed us, dressed in models as stylish as sexy for the release of Nine. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as sophisticated as usual, had opted for a dark "lady".
The Promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that only allows you to watch its email, without offering the possibility of seeing certain types of attachments or browsing the Internet.
He enjoyed his five minutes of glory in the United States, when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
In fact, it’s harder to see it on the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek offers a very low price and monthly subscription, which is less than half of what it costs, for example, an iPhone data subscription.
Given its success, the company launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free lifetime data service, six times more expensive than the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
He is just as limited as his great-grandfather, but has a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it means to give up data when crossing a border or desperately looking for a coffee shop on the Wi-Fi (or a Fon connection) to access its mail.
The idea of a fixed-price roaming is incredibly seductive and it has long been expected to work.
Indeed, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but as far as I am concerned, I would need to have done a physical thesis to understand them and good glasses to read the little characters.
The repeated reminders by the European Commission to propose affordable roaming rates across Europe have barely had a noticeable effect.
Outside of the country of origin, we hesitate to use the data, and we are not wrong.
The fact that a small device like the FonPeek (it’s still curious that it’s called Fon while it doesn’t have Wi-Fi) offers this type of tariffs means that operators start thinking differently and are studying different proposals that allow them to profit their data network.
Kindle is another good example, it includes downloading books and other research on the Internet.
No subscription and no gallery.
This is a connected device and you pay for it when you buy it and not every month.
And that’s what I hope to see someday for the FonPeek: a lifetime-access purchase option like Peek already offers it in the United States.
Not that I want to buy it.
I'm looking at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I just wish it because I think it’s a more just formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's favorite color
Yellow is probably the favorite color of the First Lady of the United States.
If she went to Barack Obama’s presidency with a dress and a coat of this color, she chose the same one to accompany him in the second moment, undoubtedly the most important of her life: the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore a very similar pattern on these two occasions: in addition to their similar color, a yellow pulling towards green with bright reflections, both times, the outfit consisted of three parts: the dress, the jacket and the coat, in the same fabric, and was decorated with a large embroidery or a collar.
So, at first glance, it would seem that the First Lady of the United States followed the footsteps of the Princess of Asturias and chose to put on the same outfits.
But the fabric in which the two sets are cut makes them very different.
If it was a thick lace to take office, on the other hand, it wore a printed veil in Oslo.
The accessories are also different: green heel shoes for the first time, and a similar model, but golden, this time.
The hairstyle has also changed: the hair is now lifted as she wore them loose the previous time.
75% of working mothers have had occupational problems because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of young generations who want to be mothers.
This is what the study “Women’s Fertility and Professional Career in Spain” carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer reveals.
The survey, which was conducted on 9,737 women aged 15 to 75, leaves no room for doubt: 75% of working mothers saw their careers limited because of maternity.
The study indicates that there are many differences regarding the beginning of couple life and the number of children, whether the woman is working or not, and the type of employment employed.
Those who have no activity outside the home, work part-time or have an unstable job, get married earlier, have their first pregnancy earlier, and have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, are pushing back into couple life and first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women between the ages of 35 and 49 with a fixed job have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after they have settled in a couple. This figure increases to 4.1 among those working in the public sector. “These data show that women with a stable job needed more time in their lives to get it together and get it back to them.
In addition, the type of employment exerted greatly influences maternity, but less the start date of common life,” explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of study is another factor that diverges between the age of marriage of women and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the more they get married and have their first child late.
The difference also persists among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49-year-old group, those who completed elementary and higher education were mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 years on average, respectively.
“Another distinction also appears among women, depending on their level of study.
While those who have completed elementary studies get married and have their first child before finding a stable job, those who have completed middle or higher education reverse this program and give priority to obtaining a stable job as a prerequisite for marriage and the arrival of a child.
Diane Kruger is well worth it.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its jealous list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress will embody the image of several products of the brand, enchanting with the universal motto “Because I am well worth it”.
The protagonist of Joyous No<0xC3><0xAB>l, one of the most elegant actresses on the international stage, comes to join other celebrities registered at L’Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter this club were the actresses Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millonaire).
In men, the cosmetics brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dre Grey, anatomy lessons) and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's companion in Lost).
The Prices of British Fashion
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
Its greatest representatives, creators and models, both yesterday and today, have gathered for the annual award ceremony, which took place in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed the appointment.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter, Georgia May Jagger, elected Best Model of the Year.
The Axe Poker by Manuel Vincent
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer de aces (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty "radiographies" of writers who have passed through his literary life (and sometimes his other life).
It does not do so according to the predictable and apprehensible genres (biographical summary, life and work), but by looking for something similar to the ignition core of the created character.
The journey is exciting and Vincent does not spare fears or illuminations.
Delicious pleasure, this book is also a moving invitation to readings and re-readings.
I'll leave you here for a few seconds.
Albert Camus: “In his pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical impulse, the same that I felt without naming it: the pleasure against funest destiny, morality without guilt, and innocence without any god.”
On Samuel Beckett: “The Nihilist, an allegorical Christian, wrote what he had in the blood, not in the head, between powerlessness and ignorance, with a stunning poetic humor, meaningless, like the knife blade that nearly killed him.”
“Our man was inspired by this woman of a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of murder, a spiritual privilege that consisted of reaching heaven through the path of loss.”
On James Joyce: "The Ulysse was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand meters summits of universal literature, which must be engraved on the north side, on which the best climbers are still and still taken."
William Faulkner: “He was a strange guy.
Of himself, he sometimes said that he was the heir to a landowner of the county and other times that he was the son of a black and a crocodile.
These two dreams were great.”
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: “This writer collects the demented cry pushed from a bridge by this character from Munch to carry his echo to the bottom of the night of the twentieth century, in his literary form, and he did so in the escape of himself and invoking posterity with a violent discourse.”
On Dorothy Parker: “One day she got on her knees and prayed, ‘Dear God, I beg you to stop writing like a woman.’
On Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were engraved the verses of Spenser: "Sleep after effort, / after storm the port, / rest after war, / after life, tired of happy death."
Virginia Wolf: “In her luggage she also carried her depressions.
Her husband accepted very normally that she told him that Edward VII was spying on him among the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
We have never seen a man so patient and in love with a neurosis whose literary talent surpassed madness.”
Sur Pío Baroja: “What would Martín-Santos do if he tried to conceal Joyce at Baroja?
What would Benet try if he didn't shoot Baroja by Faulkner?
What if it is not to seek the glory of this man, that he may serve him as a pedestal?
A cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother, who is about 70 years old, was walking in our neighborhood of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years old passed by her and our dog, a male blood, saved from the SPA and weighing no more than six kilograms, and without a word, they smashed it, they stabbed it with two hands.
Our anger is immense because we don’t see what’s fun to attack for free a defenseless little animal that, in addition, was left behind.
Add to this the indignation of a lady who was walking quietly and who, when she insulted these individuals, managed to fear for her physical integrity, since an energetic person who attacks an animal is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an elderly person, or, ultimately, more capable of doing it.
The episode took place around 5:00 p.m., on a Tuesday like any other, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog has been chewing all day.
We have of course filed a complaint with the district police department even though we doubt that it is useful for a great deal and to avoid touching the sensitivities, we just want to clarify that the cowardly killers were Spanish.
Anger has led us to denounce this fact.
We don’t understand what happens in young people so they find it fun to abuse a defenseless animal for free that gives us affection, friendship and keeps us company.
We don’t know where good education and respect for animals and people has gone.
Michelin and Fesvial, sets for helmet wear
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the wear of the helmet, mainly among the youngest motorcyclists, as the two structures have indicated today.
This initiative aims to raise awareness of the importance of helmet wear, as it is the only protective element to avoid head injuries, or even death, in the event of a two-wheeled accident.
Michelin said this campaign was part of the line of its commitment to road safety, which “beyond design and manufacturing of ever safer products” and said it was contributing to this goal through other educational and informative actions.
This new two-wheel helmet support campaign, under the slogan “To be or not to be”, will include a first phase during which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle garages, to ensure the widest distribution.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety “is a constant concern” for the company, because as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop ever safer products.
Sales of light commercial vehicles are progressing
After almost two years, the light commercial vehicle market begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6 per cent compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline, according to the figures of the employers' union of manufacturers Anfac and Ganvam, that of conceyars.
However, the good news should be highlighted, as the reference for comparison, in November 2008, was particularly poor, with a 60% decrease compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the rebound of last month, the registrations accumulated during these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, if you add all vehicles that fall into the category of light commercial vehicles (derived from tourist cars, pick-ups, vans, light trucks and light chassis trucks) 95 853 have been sold.
The large clouds that most affect their demand are not yet dispersed, for although they are also purchased by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small and medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of cases thanks to external funding.
Thus, in addition to the restrictions involved by the limitation of banking credits, other factors such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the bad economic situation need to be added.
In the face of this situation and the difference between tourism vehicles, 2000E purchase aids have served little.
In addition to individuals, independents and SMEs who wish to acquire a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emission level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre can also benefit from it, but the number of operations speaks of itself.
Yesterday, at Ganvam, we recalled again the need for the administration to pay special attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (camions and buses).
The Association of Dealers foresees a 2010 year similar to that ending, for which it calculates a 19% drop in sales (cars and 4x4).
Emergency braking assistance is now mandatory
As has been the case with the ABS anti-lock braking system and as will be the case with the ESP stability control, emergency braking assistance systems will be a mandatory element on European cars.
They are also already mandatory on newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest of the vehicles a period of deficiency has been fixed until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, although, by its mode of action, it can also help to avoid many rear shocks.
The emergency braking assistant acts by increasing the pressure on the brakes in the event of an emergency detected by the system thanks to the driver's footstep.
But the latter does not always keep the pressure up to the end.
According to a study conducted by the car manufacturer Bosch, one-third of the drivers involved in an accident had not been able to push the brake before the collision, and half of them had not benefited from its full strength.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, on the other hand, requires the maximum braking system, reducing the distance the car needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with this type of elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even more significant with the popularization of so-called emergency smart braking systems: it is estimated that one in four accidents with injured people would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that, thanks to a radar or camera, detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, he helps it by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device exerts maximum effort on the brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors postpones plan for Opel until January
While workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Saragossa) were warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva would be launched during the first week of April – probably on the 8th –, according to Javier Ortega’s plans for the time-manufactured North-April.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, agrees that each item of the plan has been approved in advance by the party concerned.
And this may imply that the final document, which will first be submitted to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where the factories are located, will be postponed until early 2010.
On the other hand, at GM, it is assured that a decision on the sale of Saab should be made in the coming days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish government has tightened pressure on the American manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with potential new buyers.
One of them might be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the nomination of the Dutch sports carmaker Skyper, supported by the Russian group Converg, takes importance.
In the event that none of them agree, GM could sell part of Saab to Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To design their latest and valuable jewelry, Porsche engineers started out of the Boxster S and managed to slim it down to just under 80 kilograms, leaving the balance to only 1,275 kilograms.
This led them to move, first of all, from the automatic roof which was replaced by a manual blinded roof, allowing to reduce by 21 kilograms, to use aluminium doors such as those of the GT3, 15 other kilograms less, to remove the air conditioner, 13 kilograms, to reduce by 7 kilograms, to 64 kilograms, to reduce the tank of my litter.
Finally, they gave up the CDR-30 audio system, winning another six kilograms and replacing the door handles with fabric handles, saving the remaining kilogram.
Although the model also exists with the double clutch PDK box, the test was carried out on a six-speed manual box model, mainly on California secondary network roads, in the mountains, with particularly turbulent turns.
His behavior can only be described as irreproachable.
The loss of weight does not prevent the car from driving on the ground with lead.
On the contrary: it was a long time ago that we had not tested such a small and lightweight model that, at the same time, guarantees as much safety in the bends, including at high speeds.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his musclesà small speed for the necessary time, until we asked him to sprint, brake, recover and push his engine again...
It's what we wanted out. Thanks to its direction, as communicative as it is, the car will do what our hands will indicate on the steering wheel.
And she will do it with surgical precision.
The sound of a motor at will
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be enhanced with the “sport” option or thanks to a system that changes the ruggedness of the engine, already used on the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether at the stop or during recovery.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The coating of the roads we traveled with the Boyxster Spyder was quite damaged, but the car handled the chicken nests well.
The electronic assistants barely attended the entire route, while on some turns we found glass in the early morning and engravings, later in the morning.
Ultimately, an ultralight car, the most fun to drive and which is much more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will be on sale in February 2010, at a price of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70,831.
" Bag Girl "
Intimate friend of Karl Lagerfeld, icon of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional star of home parades, the singer shows her face as bad girl with as much content as her Chanel bags.
More than a “Bad Girl” or “It Girl”, it’s a “Bag Girl”.
Baskonia Offers Victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral achieved a brilliant triumph at 91-82 during its visit to the hard terrain of the Maccabi Electra, despite the many absences suffered by Dusko Ivanovic's team. She thus placed herself at the head of her group, after the great show of Mirza Teletovic (who, with three points of her best score, was the best of eight basketball team).
The Vitoria team managed to fill the significant absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of commitment and collective work, even though it had to wait until the end to win the victory.
In addition, the great skill from the perimeter, with 16 baskets with three points scored, largely determined the final victory.
The game began quickly for the blues and reds, who took advantage from the start.
The fact that the first four baskets of the Vitoria team were marked from the perimeter made it a prediction that they had jumped on the Israeli field with hot wrists.
English and Teletovic were the main craftsmen of the 18-20 final of the first quarter.
The second quarter was on the same tone, but Alava's team chose Barac's inner play and Eliyahu's work, which was received by acclamations and applause back to his old home, to increase their advantage at the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to be seen as the best player of his team, with 13 points scored, although the "less six" score of Splitter already made predictions that this night would not be the best of the Brazilian.
But in this game, despite the fact that they were on the right track at the break, nothing was played, far from there, and the Avala team wanted to remind the Vitoria team that they didn't win so easily on their field, and thanks to "Elias' hand", they managed to enter the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to making the yellows take advantage of the luminous (50-49).
Other Difficulties
The Ivanovic players, wounded but far from being dead, needed to chain up some action capable of breathing, and that is when Mirza Teletovic's machine gun emerges which, with three baskets to three consecutive points, with the help of three baskets (English to 67 points) and the help of the sco-art to one point (English to 67 points) and Rimit to the end.
Avala's team went out to play everything for the last period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) warned that they were not going to let anyone take what they deserved during the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to support it from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for faults, Ivanovic’s players did not rush, defended well, and although the Israelis had approached in the last minute (80-85), the game had already been played and the victory was escaping in Tel Aviv for the first time of its season.
Injuries prevent Unicaja from delivering battle
Unicaja lost noisily in Greece against Olympiacos and gave him the head of Euroliga Group B, during a match marked by the absences of Unicaja players, especially in the domestic game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated Greek victory.
The Malaga team has not been frightened by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship Pavilion or by the size of its rival, probably one of the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game of the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to dream. An aggressive defense and three baskets with three consecutive points, two of the leader Omar Cook and one of Guillem Rubio who blew up the local team 12-18, in the ninth minute.
The Olympiacos were surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the local team's arsenal with the home game of Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, allowed to reverse the score 22-20, at the thirteenth minute, when an action, a start of a fight, between the Williams and the Beyrous managers.
The Greek team began to work by showing its superiority in both camps, while the outing for injury of English pivot Joel Freeland and Carlos Jiménez's three personal faults weighed on the Unicaja.
Internal players and Lithuanian goalkeeper Linas Kleizas, with their three-point baskets, scored an advantage of 44-32, in the nineteenth minute.
An impossible uphill
The third period was particularly offensive for the Olympiacos, who, despite the 19 losses, showed up and even managed to match the difference of the match played in Malaga 66-48, at the twenty-seventh minute, making the head of the group cancel.
The Unicaja was trying to overcome the absences and the last exit of Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the match.
Despite all these problems, the Unicaja, thanks to its organization, Cook's three-point baskets, and Lewis' support, left a little hope with 66-57, in the thirty-first minute.
But the victory was virtually impossible because the Olympiacos proved implacable when the players put pressure and showed their superiority in centimeters in the area.
Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to climb the score to 81-62, to the thirty-seventh minute, and the Unicaja surrendered, accepting the victory of the Olympiacos.
How much should you pay based on your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they deserve based on their profile, thanks to a new Trovit app, the search engine with the largest number of small real estate, jobs and vehicles in Spain.
The “How Much Should You Be Paid?” tool calculates the salary of users from more than 140,000 jobs available to Trovit in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you must register your profession, your years of experience, your age and the city you want to work in.
The search engine has detected that, as a rule, the Spanish worker “feels badly paid,” said Trovit’s product manager Albert Ribera in a statement.
According to the data available to Trovità from its search engines in the UK and France, the Spanish are the least well-paid.
A British computer programmer receives <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>45,226 gross annually and a French one, <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>31,059, while a Spanish one receives <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>24,000.
Similarly, a driver receives <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>34,247 gross annually in England, <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>25,751 in France and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the least well-paid work in Spain is server work, with 11,592 euros net annually, followed by seller work, with 14,725 euros, and worker work, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought after jobs on the Internet in the last three months are drivers, half-time jobs and social worker jobs.
Brazil sets a date for departure from Zelaya
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya’s stay at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The overthrown president must give up the diplomatic mandate no later than 27 January 2010, the date of the official end of his mandate.
Francisco Catunda, head of business at the Brazilian embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed to TV Globo that Mel knows he has to leave the embassy, where he has been a refugee since September 21, before that date.
“He is aware that he must leave on January 27, at the end of his mandate, he must seek another destination.”
The channel also quoted the former official, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the end of the deadline: “My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government,” Zelaya said on the phone.
After the November 29 election (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, the same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation ultimately failed, as Zelaya refused the political exile condition that was meant to be imposed on him by the de facto government presided over by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much
After the pink days since last spring, during which asset inflation has become the dominant value in the markets, uncertainty arises again, which is not surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment where agents make decisions about an uncertain future by nature.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilize markets was to monetize debt by direct and indirect purchases of assets by giving plenty of liquidity at close to zero rates, so that financial institutions buy assets to mobilize.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have been virtually finalized and, without questioning their non-conformist liquidity policy, they are starting to put a bit of sand in the wheels, as the ECB did, with their auction to a year next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to maintain economic recovery without heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of the reduction of risk premiums.
Exchange volatility and corporate bond discrepancies are increasing again, although they remain very far from the paranormal levels they reached earlier this year.
States have been obliged to socialize private risk, and public debt has again been affected.
There is again a flight to quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the refuges chosen by investors, causing an increase in differences between the euro area countries and Germany.
Spain was barely affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor'sa threatened with a new revision to the lower qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a bit of uncertainty is not bad to silence moral risk advocates, who were again trying to provoke a case of awareness among global economic policymakers who had stemmed the destructive effects of credit limitations on the destruction of credit, while doing so would be a detrimental day.
However, the situation in Dubai resembles a tribal struggle between the Emirates to regain power in the Emirates, and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that conceals a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the pot of roses.
Prodi did so in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be perfectly irrational for the Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a euro-area member country to fail to meet its commitments.
What is logical, on the other hand, is that Ecofin has encouraged the Greek government to be transparent and makes its citizens accountable for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are facing an episode of standardizing transitional risk premiums, after some excesses in high positions, this would be predictable.
In the case of Spain, as long as our discrepancies in public debt increase as the obligations of European companies increase, we do not have to worry.
If the European discrepancies decreased and ours continued to increase, it would be a Spanish idiosyncratic risk.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anecdote. When our forecast indicators force most of the study services to anticipate their relaunch models and to revise upwards their forecasts for 2011, in addition to the OECD and the European Commission, which have returned to much of the burden with a Japanese model for their economy.
Again, this seems to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even if for the moment “ caution is a mother of security”.
Connected sectors
The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday before the subcommittee of the Congress of MEPs, where Spain’s energy strategy for the next two decades is discussed these days.
After his speech, which was followed by that of the President of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr. Galán sketched for the press what he had mentioned before the subcommittee, at eight o'clock.
For Iberdrola’s president, Spain needs to invest <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 billion by 2020 and another <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion between that date and 2030, in case the nuclear power plants remain in operation today.
If this is not the case, the necessary investments would not amount to 60 000 million but to 95 000.
In contrast, Iberdola believes that for the next decade, investments should not be devoted to increasing production capacity, but to distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020 onwards, the issue will change, and power will need to be increased.
Its focus is on both gas and coal power plants, with mechanisms for recovering carbon dioxide and, above all, on renewable energies.
In this area, he considers that an additional 18,000 MW are needed, with other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the government’s recently approved Sustainable Economy Bill is in line with what his company demands, did not want to attack the royal decree to encourage national coal consumption, which contradicts climate warming policies.
According to him, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this sense, despite the "punctual" measures, as the president of Iberdrola called them.
In any case, Galán believes that investment decisions, although they are in the long run, must begin to be made, as they take some time before they reach maturity and that a stable remuneration framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins Aer Lingus handling market in ten airports
The Swiss company Swissport, a subsidiary of Ferrovial for airport services on the ground, will play the role of a privileged partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus, for freight services, in ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, whose economic terms have not been disclosed, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a collaborative protocol to create the Intelligent Infrastructure Innovation Centre.
The alliance envisages an investment of 20 million by 2012, 50% of which will come from Ferrovial.
One of the centre's tasks will be to conduct research on energy efficiency on highways and airports.
Acciona contests its first motorway in Australia in Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is battling for its first concession highway in Australia, a market on which it already works as an energy company and water manager.
The construction site at stake is an estimated tunnel of <0x24>1,700 million (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,047 million).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A 5-kilometre tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the East Coast, is the option to allow Acciona to establish itself in the country as a public works company and motorway dealer.
The city council wants to be able to do so by the end of 2014.
After choosing the public/private collaboration (PPP for its initials in English) to carry out the project, as part of a business plan under the auspices of Erns & Young, the local administration already has a list of finalists who will be in charge of the construction and the operation of the peage.
In anticipation of their bids in May, the planned investment amounts to <0x24>1,700 million (about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,047 million) and in the final phase three consortiums, with a significant presence of European manufacturers, are facing.
The Transcity group is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in smoothness, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian manufacturers, while the second, installed in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground works.
Against the Acciona team, the Northern Direct consortium is built, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French builder group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium to pass the test is LBRJV, the capital of which is shared between the Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German manufacturer Hochtief, which in turn has the participation of ACS), another local company, Bauderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger, the public company Railfinger Berger) and the trailloise company.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large construction sites and privatizations, but entering them is a major challenge, if not through the acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy followed by the companies Hochtief and Bilfinger, already mentioned, in addition to their Asian references, and which remains an unvalid step for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS has barely acquired a position in this market through its 30% stake in Hochtief, Leighton’s owner.
Millionaire Assets
Acciona focuses on a geographic area of greatest importance for the sector, on which it already has a wide presence through its energy supplier activity and in the desalination sector.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the grouping of companies responsible for erecting and managing the Adelaide desalinizer, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the construction and infrastructure management markets.
The underground toll road, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and said Northern Link (north link), is called to connect the Toowong western highway to the peripheral road to Kelvin Grove (see map), by 4 kilometres of tunnel. It is the largest of the existing bridge.
The schedule set by the administration indicates that the auction will take place during the summer of 2010 and that the work will begin in December next year.
Despite the fact that this road will be open to traffic at the end of 2014, it is not planned to be completed before 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include twice two tracks, an electronic charging system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland will provide <0x24>500 million (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>308 million) for funding.
Brisbane already offers jobs in Hochtief
Australia continues to largely profit Hochtief, which yesterday mentioned the obtaining of a contract with the government estimated at <0x24>154 million.
The company owned by ACS will equip, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national high-speed fiber optic network.
This intervention will allow 400,000 people to have fast internet access and provide work to the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company handed over the 27-story King George Tower construction project in the city of Brisbane. Work has not yet begun and Hochtief completed the sale for 129 million.
In the UK, specifically Manchester, she will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>75 million.
FCC to be awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
The FCC, through its Alpine subsidiary, is to be awarded the construction of a 2.1-kilometer-long tunnel for a highway in Slovenia, for an amount of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>64.5 million.
The company obtained the contract a few days after being in charge of the expansion of the Bosruck Tunnel (Austria) for a sum of 130 million.
Alpine thus consolidates its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The construction is scheduled to start in early 2010 and will take 32 months to complete.
Mrs. Rushmore is awarded Renfe's advertisement
Renfe has entrusted the advertising and marketing services of the next two years to the agency Mrs. Rushmore, for a budget of about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 million per year, the railway operator said.
The contract mentions the possibility of two 12-month extensions each. Mrs. Rushmore was selected from 16 agencies that submitted to the tender organized by Renfe, among which four were finalists, including TBWA who was responsible for creativity during the last three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
A <0x24>63 million fine to France Telecom to curb competition
The French competition regulator has imposed a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>63 million on France Telecom for its anti-competitive conduct in the country’s Caribbean region.
According to this institution, the operator has limited competition on fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive agreements, tariffs and consumer loyalty programs on the margins of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has accumulated more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>450 million in fines since 1994, due to the obstacles it puts on its competitors.
The sanction imposed yesterday has also been increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and is therefore recurrent.
A shop of apps
On the other hand, the mobile phone company of the French company has followed the footsteps of other operators and opened an Internet application store, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
Initially, the Orange app store will be active in France and the UK.
We will have to wait for 2010 to arrive in other countries such as Spain.
Their participation in the Champions League has reported 476.4 million to Real Madrid and Barça since its inception.
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since its birth in 1992.
In fact, Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have won 467.4 million, placing them in third and fifth place of the clubs that have made the most money in this competition.
Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings glory, but it is also one of the leading sources of revenue for big clubs.
In fact, the competition allocated <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5,362.5 million to 105 teams (including 12 Spaniards) who have participated in the event since the creation of the tournament, during the 1992-1993 season, according to UEFA information.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona were well served during this division.
The white club was the third on the continent to earn the most money for its participation, and the only one, with A.C. Milan, has won the trophy three times.
The Catalan club, currently holding the title and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
At the top of the list are Manchester United and Munich Bayern, the two teams who, in addition, have made the most money for their participation in the last Champions League.
And that, even though they lost to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, in terms of the money reported by the Champions League, although it has won more titles than any other (five, while Italy has won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex money allocation procedure applied by UEFA.
For this year, the organization chaired by Michel Platini plans to earn 1,090 million thanks to the Champions League.
Of this sum, UEFA will dedicate <0x24>413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the qualifying matches (including Atlético de Madrid) received <0x24>2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million only to be there, plus 550 00 euros for each match played.
There is also a bonus in case of victory (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>800,000) and equality (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400,000 for each team). Those who arrive in the eighth final receive three million each, the eight teams who arrive in the quarter-final receive 3.3 million.
The last four teams will receive <0x24>4 million each.
And the champion will win 9 million, compared to the 5.2 received by the other finalist.
For fixed payments, a club will earn at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
On the other hand, Barça raised 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But in addition, there are variable payments, to which 337.8 million are dedicated.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important, and has four squares.
The champion of the previous year earns 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid based on the number of matches played during the current year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>61 million for 29.9% of Sos.
The Nueva Rumasa Group listed the details of the share purchase offer by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9% of Sos’ capital.
A percentage that does not force it to launch a public procurement offer (OPA) for all securities.
Concretely, Nueva Rumasa offers <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,5025 per share, which will be reimbursed in 10 years and will be paid at a rate of 1% per year for this postponement.
Yesterday, Sos’ shares ended at <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.85, so Nueva Rumasa’s offer rated the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects Sos’ actual valuation.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 advisers.
The Jerez Group provides a 15-day deadline for shareholders to indicate their interest in the sale of securities.
The CNMV said it had not been informed of the offer, although the Ruiz Mateos company claimed it had contacted the regulator.
If so, the settlement would amount to 611.7 million, while Sos’ capital is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos continues the restructuring of his leadership.
In an attempt to stay out of possible purchase offers and goes and comes judiciary from her former directors, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of María Luis Jordá as Director of Internal Audit.
A decision that makes it the first woman to occupy a leading position in the food business.
This is a newly created post that will depend directly on the group chairman.
And it is not free from controversy, as the company remains immersed in the legal battle for the alleged diverting of more than 230 million Sos to Salazar companies.
In addition, the possibility that in the coming months Sos reveals new distractions of funds cannot be ruled out.
On credit to Salazars, former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and <0xC3><0x81>ngel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) said yesterday before the National Audience that they had been informed of the <0x24>212 million divertement without knowing the destination.
CNMV Authorizes Paternina Exclusion OPA Presented by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) authorised yesterday the exclusion OPA presented by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on 9 October last.
The supervisory body explained that it authorised this operation because it understood that its terms were aligned with the standards in force and that it considered the content of the explanatory leaflet submitted “sufficiency” following the amendments applied on 2 December.
The CNMV stated that the offer concerns the acquisition of 550 008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, representing 8.95 % of the share capital, consisting of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
In addition, he explained that 5,592,778 million shares were immobilized and could not be transferred in any way before the end of the offer, which he indicated was priced by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the current standards.
New tools for the expertise of cars
In these days of bad weather and accidents, car garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of cars that have been injured are brought back to a garage, where an expert has to evaluate the damage suffered and the cost of repair.
Each accident is different, and calculating the cost of parts and working time can be a long and complex work.
Calculating by hand the cost of a repair between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including the parts and the workforce can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the assistance of the latest computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
That’s why almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
Disaster Assessment and Maintenance Services and Solutions Providers are committed to collecting information provided by manufacturers, then processing it and offering it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the North American group Solera, is the leading company; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
Other companies competing in the field of assessment tools and sector information development are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with data provided by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, so over the last five years more versions, variants and engines have been launched than in the previous fifteen years.
When a new car comes out on the market, these companies get to work.
This is a very hard job, because you need to catalog each of the thousand parts of the vehicle and register its price.
In addition, a “intelligent” graphic image of each model is established on which one can click on the different parts of a tourist car.
If it is a massively sold model, the work can be done in a week if the process progresses very quickly.
If it is a small car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, they have information about the Porsche, for example, but not the Ferrari or the Lamborghini.
In the case of vehicles in circulation, the figure exceeds 99%.
To carry out the work of documentation and database development, Audatex has eight centers worldwide (in Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them specializes in certain brands.
The National Headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex invests <0x24>90 million each year to develop these databases.
Every month, 2.5 million data are recorded, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer various products.
The most common application relates to repair and maintenance, but depending on the country, there are also tools for handling broken parts or for calculating the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but it does in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support it can provide to industry professionals.
This company offers ten different tools, the flagship product being AudaPlus, the standard disaster assessment solution for experts.
There are cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it takes into account the estimated repair times by the manufacturer or the paint bars.
This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, up to ten times a month.
Then, each insurance company, which carries out thousands of expertise, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it came out of the assembly line, only thanks to its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glasses, and AudaSubastas is an open server for the professional sector on the Internet that allows you to auction on vehicles declared to be destroyed.
Its statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, conducting geo-demographic analyses or knowing common problems by brand or model.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a particular brand went to the garage for a breakdown or how many suffered serious accidents for a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
It sells, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and provides digital images, as well as access to the manufacturer’s official parts, prices and times.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971, as a provider of services and solutions for disaster assessment, failure or invoice maintenance.
The GT Assessment Guide is a historical reference product on the market.
The company works with 24,000 users in garages, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its turnover has increased by 20% per year over the past three years, making a turnover of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, she undertook her internationalization process, with the establishment of an office in Paris.
Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company’s sources, 62% of its turnover is achieved in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. It works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 garages, of which 3,000 are located in Spain.
The global turnover of the Solera Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will amount to <0x24>557 million, an increase of 3.3% compared to 2008.
In our country, the company will receive <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>19.1 million, 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was listed on <0x24>1 billion, today its shares are valued at a total of <0x24>2,400 million.
Since 2007, he has been on the New York Stock Exchange and is part of the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
Online auctions for accident cars
In October, the Solera Group purchased Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of cars, motorcycles and special vehicles that were damaged.
The operation involved a cost of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>59.5 million for 85% of the company’s capital, which could expand next year to the remaining 15%.
The aim of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This estimate and sales service is intended exclusively for industry professionals, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, garages, cash registers and professional sellers who must be registered before they begin to carry out operations.
Established in 1996 in Germany, this platform manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, including 500,000 in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
There are currently more than 1,500 sellers and 4,000 experts registered on the site.
It manages 3,000 ads per day and in the Spanish market, 100 new ads are published every day.
In accordance with Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been removed can no longer circulate, but on the other hand, some parts that are not damaged can be used as spare parts.
Collection cars can be re-registered, although they have been withdrawn, after complex procedures.
Four-step garage fees
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex guarantees that the user gets a quote in just four steps: identifying the vehicle, finding the spare part, creating a quote and generating it.
Ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially to convince older professionals who, to a greater or lesser extent, are receptive to the use of new management techniques.
The database comprises 1,034 vehicles, including 666 tourism, 109 off-road, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, to use it, a computer and an Internet connection are needed.
Once the model to be repaired is identified by its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and then the necessary part is selected.
The user can include variables such as labor price, increases or discounts, then he can print the quote to return it to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an estimate tool like AudaPlus, but a catalog of references.
The main difference between these two systems is that the one for garages does not include the estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is 350 euros per year, which can be credited.
The company Audatex is currently working to make these images in three dimensions.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with a very good eye, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it to see the inside.
