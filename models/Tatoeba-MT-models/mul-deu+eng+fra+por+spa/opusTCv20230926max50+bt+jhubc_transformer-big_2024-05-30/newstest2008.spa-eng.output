European inflation slipped in food
Accelerated inflation, recorded in the euro area, is primarily due to the vertiginous increase in food prices.
Price increases in November have been higher than expected in the 13 euro area countries, recording - after 2.6 percent in October - an annual inflation of 3.1 percent - announced the Luxembourg-based Union Statistical Office.
Official forecasts were only as likely as 3 percent, Bloomberg said.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike the U.S., British and Canadian issuer banks, did not cut basic interest, on the pretext that the decline, along with rising commodity prices and the reduction in forced unemployment, would lead to a spiral of inflation.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below, but at least close to 2 percent.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in the trap 22: "negotiating" about inflation so that it later does not have to intervene on this issue.
Inflation of 3.3 per cent, recorded in Germany, broke the record for twelve years, while in Spain it increased from 3.6 per cent to 4.1 per cent.
Inflation sparked in the euro area as a result of sluggish food and energy prices.
Wheat-to-grain quotas increased by 88 percent, and soybean quotas reached their highest level since 1973.
Similarly, in 2007, much more had to be paid for vegetable oil and dairy products.
The price of crude oil on the world market rose by 52 percent this year, reaching black gold almost <0x24>100 a barrel last month.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will jump from 2.1 per cent current to 2.5 per cent, while for 2009 it will drop already to 1.9.
According to analysts, annual inflation will remain around 3 percent in the next 3 or 4 months, but the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to double interest rates during 2008.
Gallup predicts a government crisis
After a long stagnation, by early December the support of the Alliance of Young Democrats increased significantly, reaching its peak since 2002, while the Gallup never before experienced such a low level – 13% – in the case of the Socialists.
The difference in the case of secure party voters - due to the greater firmness of opposition voters - would mean more than two-thirds (71 percent) of support against a fifth for the socialists (20 percent).
According to the survey, the Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Free Democrats would not even reach the limit needed to have some parliamentary seat: their support within the entire population is 2%.
Among the safe voters there are one percent more supporters on both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even compared to the lowest point above – it has never been so high, 41 percent of those who considered the country’s economic situation particularly bad, while another 46 percent believe the situation is quite bad.
Families, after the most hopeful expectations of spring and summer, are now more pessimistic about the change in their own economic situation.
As for the coming year, the majority of the population has the deterioration of the situation and only one tenth expects improvement.
In December, 71 percent of the respondents, a figure higher than any previous Gallup survey, estimated that the President of the Government is doing rather poorly than well his duties.
13 percent of the respondents trust Ferenc Gyurcsány, while Viktor Orbán has the support of 38 percent of the respondents.
54 percent of the population do not trust the head of government at all, and 27 percent do not trust the president of the Young Democrats Alliance.
One of the indicators of the setting up of the political situation is that, what proportion of society thinks it is possible to control the dissatisfaction experienced with the person of the Head of Government without a change of government.
While after the October riots last year, 35 percent thought it would be desirable to keep the government and the head of government in power, today this proportion is only 20 percent, while the relative majority (33 percent) believe that the only solution is to hold new elections.
Interest in the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60 percent of respondents answered the question about participation that they would surely participate and another 20 percent said they are likely to participate.
Comparatively, in "general elections to be held on Sunday" would surely participate only 55 percent of the population and another 15 percent believe their participation is likely. Based on the current intentions of voters there is no doubt about the outcome of the popular consultation.
74 percent of the population would disapprove of paying tuition fees, 79 percent of the service of medical consultations and 84 percent of the hospital care.
If we observe these proportions only among the safe participants in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters would reject the introduction of study rights, payment for medical consultations and hospital care.
The most expensive is the Auchan, the Tesco has quintupled its prices
The average price increase of 16 percent was maintained by the supermarkets of the gold commercial triangle of Budaörs, with the difference that this year has not increased VAT.
Article of Daily Economy
This year also increased by an average of 16 percent in the gold commercial triangle of Budaörs the Napi newspaper’s usual Christmas basket, but in all hypermarkets growth was much higher than HUF 1,000.
As in December of last year, prices in food supermarkets had already “dispersed”, so there was no dramatic percentage increase compared to the high starting point.
However, it is obviously frightening for consumers the fact that what they could buy last year at a price well below HUF 9,000, today for today they cannot do even for 10,000.
The Napi basket in the hypermarkets studied exceeded with a minimum of HUF 91 the psychological limit of HUF 10,000.
And the highest value basket was HUF 10,573.
(in 2003 that basket cost HUF 6800.)
The price of Unicum liquor and fish remained almost at the level of the previous year, but there was a sharp increase in peanut breast fillet, nut and butter seed.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed data from the Central Bureau of Statistics, although in the Auchan we also found a kilo of bread for the price of HUF 139.
Competition did not reduce the price of the product to less than HUF 200.
It was also surprising in this store that the price of the Coca-Cola with a two-liter redeemable bottle cost less than HUF 200, so this product, even with the price of the bottle, cost only HUF 257.
However, in the basket of Napi Auchan was the most expensive, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, with respect to last year’s Christmas prices, Cora rose by 15, while Tesco and Auchan by about 18 percent the prices listed in the Napi basket.
Compared last year’s most expensive basket with this year’s cheapest basket, the difference has been 12 percent, while growth between last year’s cheapest and this year’s most expensive basket has been 21 percent.
The average growth was HUF 1480.
Last year the average price growth was 1206 HUF, so that during Christmas last year in prices was felt the increase in VAT.
It was this process that shattered trade, the supermarkets were visibly unable to make a decision on the price margin to be applied to each product and to calculate the effect of the price change on consumption.
(If the trader misplanes the speed of circulation of a product, it may lose a significant profit in the margin that fits the sales volume.)
The increase in the price of the Napi basket reached such extremes as a result of the increase in VAT, which was the most expensive by 1720 HUF above the recorded value in 2006, while in the cheapest the difference was only 844 HUF.
This year did not occur such extremes, since the highest price now has been 1630 HUF more than last year and the cheapest also increased by 1284 HUF.
Compared to the two Christmas seasons, catastrophic price growth was recorded in less than 20 months, in hypermarkets increased by more than 30 percent the price of consumer goods first need.
(However, this does not necessarily confirm the figures of the Central Bureau of Statistics: this office, in the case of some first-aid foods, recorded a price increase of more than 30 percent over the 12-month period.
For example, in addition to wheat, also in the case of eggs.)
According to the Napi basket, in the latter case this seems almost impossible, because in the price of this product that was quite expensive already last year compared to the base, it was recorded, in the worst case, only a 10 percent increase in prices.
According to all indices, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than eggs, and could impose drastic price increases even on multinationals.
Hypermarkets don’t complain about the commercial gold triangle, they constantly talk about positive results.
According to our collected experiences, most consumers from the three stores visited are no longer interested in prices.
Of all products they buy large quantities, carrying by pallets the preserved foods.
On Wednesday morning, large queues were formed in the three stores in front of the boxes because the number of customers suddenly increased.
However, we have information that domestic sales volumes are lower, many multinationals complain to survey institutes because revenues are below their plans and not only in the case of food, but also in the case of household appliances.
In many hospitals it saves with disinfectants
This year, several thousand infections have been reported in hospitals, first of all due to the improper use of antibiotics.
The prevailing hygiene conditions in hospitals, bed bumps and staff overload do not favor infection control, says the head of the department of the National Center for Epidemiology.
In many hospitals it saves even with disinfectants.
Not long ago, an MRSA infection has been diagnosed in the traumatology department of János Hospital.
The presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria was detected in a hospitalized man after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of infection occurred in this same hospital at the beginning of the year.
A wounded from a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital and the patient himself soon afterwards had to return to the hospital as a result of the MRSA infection and since then no major surgical intervention has been possible due to the presence of the bacteria in his body.
Until December 10 this year, 1094 cases of hospital infection produced by multi-resistant agents have been registered in the National System of Nosocomialis Surveillance, said Karolina Böröcz, head of the department of the National Center for Epidemiology.
This means that this number of infections produced by multi-resistant agents has been safely recorded in hospitals, otherwise no information is available.
Nearly two-thirds of infections (683 cases) are due to MRSA, i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, resistant to methicillin-oxacillin.
A third of humans carry the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (SA) in their noses without causing any disease.
SA-produced infections (e.g. throat inflammation, amygdalite, skin infections, wound infections) react well to antibiotics and are easy to treat.
However, once it is applied excessively or improperly to antibiotics, bacteria that normally react well to antibiotics turn into highly antibiotic-resistant bacteria and quickly infect with inadequate hospital conditions.
They can cause serious hospital infections, for example wound infections or septicemia first in patients with transient or chronic immunodeficiency, patients with weakened organisms, the elderly, or people with low weight.
In the opinion of the doctor-director of the János Hospital there is nothing special about MRSA infection, these infections are daily in hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, the MRSA is only absent - said Tibor Nyulasi - where its presence is not examined.
Antibiotic-resistant
“These patients are isolated, nursing staff cares for them in rubber gloves and masks, and there are suitable antibiotics for their treatment,” said Tibor Nyulasi.
Hospitalized patients are examined beforehand to verify the presence of MRSA in their body, but even so infection can not be prevented in all cases.
It's not fashionable to take samples
It would be possible to prevent hospital MRSA infections in most cases, however current national hospital conditions do not favor the prevention of formation and contagion with multi-resistant pathogens - says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection mainly occurs in hospitals and elderly homes, hospitals should examine hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients who carry MRSA in their body.
However, microbiological sampling is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
This is also due to the fact that the National Health Box does not finance these medical examinations.
So most cases go out to the public when already visible MRSA infections occur in the patient - said the doctor-in-chief of the epidemiological center.
The European Union makes strict recommendations for the application of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national directives for treating infections and pathological frameworks.
Antibiotic therapy should be directed, that is, microbiological tests should be done to prevent resistance to drugs, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
Microbiological samples are even less frequent in the case of ambulance patients or in basic care, Karolina Börocz said.
Save with disinfectants
Scientific experiments have shown that in most cases MRSA is transmitted from one patient to another through healthcare personnel.
Therefore, hand washing, the use of rubber gloves and masks play a very important role, but there are also considerable shortcomings in hospitals in this regard.
MRSA is contagious through droplet transmission and direct contact between people, however, in national hospital circumstances it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
Moreover, the hospital rooms are often crowded, the beds are often very joint, although to prevent the epidemic, patients should be separated by at least 1.5 meters away.
Unfortunately, it can also be experienced - added Karolina Böröcz - that in less favourable economic situation hospitals is saved with disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients and therefore there is a higher likelihood of infection.
According to Karolina Böröcz, where appropriate preventive measures are followed, fewer infections of this type are reported or the pathogen infection can be stopped.
Government Programme against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection is a huge expense for the National Health Insurance Fund, so it is being fought in all countries.
In England, for example, there is a government program to prevent and reduce MRSA cases.
The program appears to be successful, according to the data provided, MRSA infections show a downward trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) prioritises the prevention of multiresistant agents (including MRSA) and hospital infections due to these pathogens.
Negative alcohol control of the police commander who caused a fatal accident
The expert official report on the case of the fatal accident caused by the District XXII police commander has been produced.
The possibility that he was driving drunk or in a turbulent state could be ruled out by the then resigned District XXII police commander, who on Tuesday atropelled and caused the death of a transient, Attila Morvai, a spokeswoman for the Prosecutor General’s Office of the Capital, said on Friday.
The expert report confirmed the result of the primary alcohol control that had already been found that the former police commander did not consume alcoholic beverages before putting himself behind the wheel.
The then chief of the police department of District XXII, on Tuesday with his private vehicle while bending Kossuth Lajos street of District XXII, attacked a 55-year-old man, who intended to cross the street, but not in the pedestrian-designated area.
(This latter fact, i.e., that the pedestrian did not use the zebra to cross the street, according to the rules of the transit code are not mitigating circumstances, the driver should always give up the step when folding.)
The transient lost his life after being hospitalized.
The district police chief resigned and requested his retirement, according to the police statement, because he was very moved by the case.
The case is being investigated by the Budapest Investigation Prosecutor’s Office.
Attila Morvai also said that the former police commander from the outset collaborated with prosecutors in charge of the investigation.
More <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million for infrastructure
Hungarian Finance Minister János Veres and European Investment Bank (EIB) Vice-President Marta Gajecka signed three credit-limit agreements in Budapest on Friday for a total of EUR 400 million to finance education, transport and environment infrastructure, as well as the energy sector.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 a budget of EUR 300 million to finance in the Hungarian budget transport and environmental protection projects, which will be carried out from the grant of the cohesion funds, of which the parties have already signed a loan contract of EUR 200 million to the remaining 100 million.
The <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million loan contract is also intended to finance the budget for educational projects.
The EIB approved a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million for this objective from Hungary, on the use of the remaining <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million will be decided at a later date, by extending the credit contract.
The parties signed a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 million contract for innovations, which the budget will mainly use for the innovation and research project of the University of Debrecen.
During the talks they also covered the theme of the construction of the 4th line of the Metro.
It was agreed that when Hungary finalises with the EU the details of the Metro’s funding, they will re-evaluate the issue of whether or not to modify the original contract and how to do so.
According to János Veres, this could happen earlier in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary worth EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest of the credits is adjusted to EURIBOR and the EIB offers an 8-year grace period, without charge for keeping the credit at the disposal of the debtor.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
It is admirable the development of the Bulgarian real estate market - the attention of all Europe is directed towards that Balkan country just mentioned.
What, where, and who buy in the EU market even cheaper, will get worse quickly?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The preferred goal for real estate acquisitions in Eastern Europe is undoubtedly Bulgaria, with its cheap ski slopes apartments and beach chalets.
The mountainous regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most preferred, while on the beaches of Albena, the "Golden Coast", the "Costa del Sol", the former Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are looking for real estate also in the surroundings of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, sooner or later the central area of the country – such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna – will awaken the interest of real estate promoters and more and more people will buy real estate in the especially cheap area of Rus.
Similarly, the capital Sofia can be attractive, the commercial and office spaces promise a rapid recovery of the investment.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe, making it a highlight during the other two seasons, in addition to summer and winter.
Therefore, cautious investors are already making their purchases, for example in the area around Bansko.
According to analysts, those who buy real estate in Bulgaria also strive to change their life and way of life.
Most customers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Also present are the Maltese and Cypriot promoters and traditionally there are many Russian customers on the Black Sea beaches and in the ski paradises.
Foreign customers can be classified into three groups – says Georgi Jankov, regional director of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those who intend to install here buy new or renovated properties for a price between 50 and 100,000 euros or old houses in bad condition between 5 and 15,000 euros, to renovate them later.
They require good communication and access, and for them the proximity of a large city, shops and generally a local doctor is important.
The second category are the buyers of chalets (Bulgaria in December was included among the top 10 holiday destinations of the Germans).
The third group consists of real estate investors who make their purchases in the hope of benefiting in the medium or long term.
The price of capital property is constantly growing, as demand is increasing.
Although in the European Union Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices, in the last five years they have suffered an annual increase of 21 percent
The increase in the price of real estate significantly outweighs wage growth.
Fodor and the Six Hundred Hungarians
According to the Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor, the expert-level meetings will end on Tuesday and on Wednesday after the official inauguration will continue minister-level negotiations on the international climate regime after 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world will decide on the Bali Roadmap that provides for efforts after the emission reduction period, as set out in the Kyoto Protocol, in force until 2012.
There are currently lively discussions on the particulars between developing countries and industrialized countries.
The United States has already indicated that at the moment it does not want to negotiate precise figures, although it tends to agree that, compared to the 1990 situation, by 2020, greenhouse gas emissions will decrease by 25 to 40 percent.
Another major topic of the conference is whether industrialized countries, in addition to reducing emissions, are willing or unwilling to provide material and technological assistance to countries in need.
A further agreement was reached on aid to developing countries.
The support fund, provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be headed by a 16-member board of directors, probably within the UN Global Environment Fund (GEF) - writes the "Place is Profit".
Six percent of Hungary's
On behalf of Hungary, Minister for Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor supports the EU’s efforts to maintain its leading role in global climate protection and promote the signing of the new international agreement by 2009.
The minister stated that the EU undertakes to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020, compared to the 1990 level, regardless of whether or not the "post-2012 agreement" will be signed and is willing to undertake to decrease by 30 percent even if the other major regions are also responsible for their development and development capabilities in the developing world.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the signatory countries of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol pledged to decrease by 5.2 per cent, among which the then 15 EU Member States pledged to meet an 8 per cent decrease.
Hungary’s commitment is to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent over the period between 1985 and 1987, which our country will meet, according to the Ministry of the Environment.
It is very much what is at stake in Bali, since within two years the international agreement on long-term climate policy will have to be signed, because if not, it is certain that its entry into force will be postponed to after 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments, assumed in the Kyoto Protocol, will not be immediately followed by the reciprocal UN report of the most internationally reducible change.
As a result, emissions reduction would be delayed and an increase of more than 2<0xC2><0xB0>C in Earth’s average temperature could not be prevented, which according to scientists would have incalculable and irreversible consequences.
The British Army Recruits on YouTube
British military units in a video distributor publish footage about actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
The British Air Force (RAD) first took advantage of YouTube services: special units displaced in Afghanistan since March 2006 are uploading videos about their actions against the Taliban, the BBC reported.
These recordings made with mini cameras mounted on the headsets are controlled in Kandahar’s general operating body, then sent to London to be uploaded to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable.
Already there are 139 recordings from the air force soldiers that have been loaded in this way to the Internet and their "channel" has already been seen by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered in the spring of 2007 under the name of "defence headquarters" and publishes videos of actions carried out in both Iraq and Afghanistan, while both the Ministry of the Commonwealth of British Nations (Commonwealth Office) and the multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube can.
Operation in Afghanistan (Afghanistan)
The air force had originally uploaded the videos for recruitment purposes, but in the view of the Ministry of Defence they also serve to present to the public the true goal of the British army’s presence abroad.
This kind of propaganda costs virtually nothing compared to conventional recruitment television spots – said defense expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC – instead, they inevitably have some political message, since in a specific way they justify the reason for being military actions decided by the government.
The Americans have made a video game.
The army is also concerned about the fact that in addition to the fearfully edited and censored recordings, amateur videos also appear in the distributor, for example on the death of soldiers: in the propaganda films "official", a bit hypocritical, the officers speak as a maximum of losses, without yet presenting the bloody party fighters.
In addition, numerous videos recorded in real operations have already been uploaded to the Internet from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan, but the British army has only recently taken advantage of this opportunity.
Americans use a slightly different form for recruitment with free downloadable shooting video games, called America's Army, in which in the midst of a more or less real situation the player can put himself directly instead of the soldiers.
Tombola and salt pastel at the Christmas party of the ministries
The Minister of Labour Monika Lamperth does not seem very sentimental: instead of the Christmas party, she will hold a work meeting for her colleagues who will be able to say goodbye in 2007 with salt pastel and coffee.
There is a ministry that will celebrate your party with live music, in another they will create the Christmas atmosphere in the heart of public officials with a tombola and a toast.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - so enjoy the power.
The state offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The biggest Christmas party will be held in the Ministry of Defence, but not for the Ministry’s workers.
On Hurricane Christmas, the children of the fallen soldiers will be given gifts, and for Missionary Christmas, the families of the soldiers who are currently carrying out missions abroad are invited to attend.
This portfolio will allocate <0x24>25 million for the festive atmosphere of the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (ANF) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (MET) will celebrate a luxurious party with respect to the parties of the other portfolios
The MET festival will be held in the House of the Future, with a total budget of HUF 4,320.000 and the six hundred ministry workers are expected to attend approximately three hundred fifty.
At the party of the wallet will reign a Christmas atmosphere, artists will also perform and there will be tombola draw.
The NAF’s Christmas cost HUF 4,700,000 and was held on Wednesday at the National Council for the Administration of Justice (CNAJ) building with musical concerts and dinner.
The rental of the room cost a million HUF, the rest of the budget was spent for the more than four hundred guests.
We have information that workers from one of the ANF departments are also invited to another Christmas party that will be held by a contest management company called the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development of Community Funds.
For this purpose they rented the entire building of the Teatro de la Comedia.
The information has not been confirmed by CHDE SA, since we are unable to communicate with the competent person.
You can attend without a suit
The CNAJ building not only hosted the party of the ANF, but also the party of the Ministry of Justice and the Police, which instead of Christmas celebrated the Lucia Day dance on December 7.
The CNAJ of them did not charge anything for the use of their facilities.
Five hundred people participated in the dance.
The party began with the minister’s greeting words and after dinner there was live bailable music.
Responding to the question of [origin] they reported: to attend the dance it was not mandatory to dress or dress at night.
The health, work and local government portfolios are preparing for modest celebrations.
The Ministry of Public Health will organize a program and a party for its workers in its own building with a budget of HUF 400,000.
On the other hand, Labour Minister Monika Lamperth does not wait for her colleagues for an official Christmas party, but for an end-of-year work meeting.
It has the participation of one hundred and eighty guests who - as reported by the press department - will only take coffee and salt pastel, so the party will not cost more than HUF 350 000.
The Minister for Local Governments, Gordon Bajnai, in turn, will simply provide with his colleagues in the classroom of the Ministry for Local Governments and Territorial Development.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will hold a Christmas party in its own event hall with the participation of 436 workers.
The Christmas party will have a budget of 2500 HUF per guest - from this budget will be paid the reception with a buffet and a toast.
Since János Veres is the minister, MF workers celebrate Christmas in the same way every year.
Instead, there will be no festive atmosphere, the official character will be given not only by the ministerial speech, but also by the afternoon schedule of its celebration.
The agriculture portfolio will offer a New Year’s reception on January 20, in the Ministry will not be celebrated Christmas.
The reception will be held at Vajdahunyad Castle of the Municipal Park and according to the portfolio, there will be a budget of 1000 HUF per person for the hundred guests.
This - according to the press department - will be a very simple reception, to which only specialized diplomats, accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These receptions, which are held every year, begin with a brief greeting speech by the minister and end with a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Education and Culture will not hold any Christmas celebrations - this is what the corresponding press departments told [origin].
In the press department of the environmental portfolio they were unable to report on the budget of the Ministry's Christmas celebrations.
What is known is that for the party to be held in the Museum of Applied Arts more than four hundred people were invited.
The forces of the giant strike are coming together
The League Syndicates and the National Federation of Workers’ Commissions will form a strike committee on Friday to coordinate Monday’s strike that will last indefinitely.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, while on Monday - the day the final vote on the public health law will be held - unemployment will begin.
Certainly this action will cause major difficulties in transport, as the railway traffic will be completely stopped and by 13 hours the workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company will also be on strike.
On Friday afternoon, League Trade Unions will report on the details of their Monday strike to be held jointly with the National Federation of Workers’ Commissions.
The strike committee of the LIGA and the National Machinery Syndicate will also be formed to coordinate Monday’s actions.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, while on Monday the participating trade unions will strike indefinitely, if no agreement is reached with the government.
That is, on the day of the parliamentary vote on the public health law, they did not report on the date of the end of the strike initiated.
If the National Assembly rejects the public health law, the unions will immediately withdraw their call for strike.
Instead, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide on the future.
On the basis of the Monday agenda of the National Assembly, it is also possible that only the public health law is voted on at very early hours of the night, or at best near midnight.
As a result of the strike that will begin on Monday, there will be significant difficulties in transport: on the railways will stop working indefinitely, in the morning it may stop part of Budapest's public transport and more than half of the interurban bus transport of the companies Volán.
At the same time, at numerous points in the country there will be a closure of half the roadways.
Numerous trade unions and civil organizations have joined the strike, their names are constantly updated on the League’s website.
Some unions announced their strike for an indefinite period of time, others for a definite period of time.
Until Thursday afternoon, the State Railway and the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) were unable to reach an agreement even on the minimum services, though, as Christmas holidays approach, more and more people travel on trains.
According to information received so far, from the start of the day until 13:00 the workers of the Budapest Collective Transportation Company will be on strike, the Budapest Airports from 7 to 9:00 in the morning, will hold a four-hour strike of the LIGA Educators of the Electric Industry and call one of the 2 Educators of the Educators of Electricity and the Sindicator of the Energy.
The Hungarian Association of Doctors will take a national strike at alternative times and the Democratic Union of Health and Social Sector Workers (SDTSSS), which is part of the Syndicate Cooperation Forum, will hold a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League is that the government withdraw its proposal on public health reform and submit a new conception to a social debate.
The second demand is that they gradually introduce the new form of calculation of pensions that will come into effect next year.
The third is to ensure, even before 2010, that, in the case of advance pensions, the occupations that deserve it can enter the system.
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (SLTF), which is part of the League Trade Unions, do not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport on the railway sidelines and await another different proposal.
Political Capital[b1]: The Hungarian Guard increases the risk in the country
According to the Risk Analysis Division of the Political Capital, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, constituted in August of this year with the support of the Movement for a Better Hungary, has increased political risk in Hungary and the region from several points of view.
The company’s “Risk Warning” states: “With the exacerbation of ethnic tensions between the Gita and non-Gita population of Hungary, even violent ethnic confrontations can occur in the short term.”
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is likely to be the provocation of an event of this nature – added the representative of the research institute.
They stated that this was due to one of the main shortcomings of the protagonists of Hungarian political life: "the protagonists of public life gave the public debate of the gypsy problem to representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who could base their political strategy on the existing Huns and gypsy discrepancies".
This aggravates the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activity of the National Guard, as a result of the great attention of the national and international average, “has significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, especially with regard to the stability and democratic development of the country.”
We are reminded that: since the fall of 2006, the reorganization of the radical and far-right groups of Hungary has received increasing publicity and impulse, and that since the summer of 2007 numerous organizations have been set up in the country that define themselves as "national self-defense associations".
"The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civil organizations, while openly proclaiming the training of their members for defense - even armed - (civil defense, national defense, public order), referring to the ineptitudes of the police, the army, i.e. the state."
They claimed that all this was done in accordance with the method that attempts to give a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on the dissatisfaction of society with politics and with political parties.
For highlighting the civil and the form of association in the case of these associations serves not only to avoid legal problems of legal registration, but is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is also a risk factor from the point of view of neighbourhood relations.
“In recent months, in numerous neighbouring states, the Hungarian Guard has been referred to as a potential danger, while the ultra-nationalist political figures of certain neighbouring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy with the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All this influences the political stability of the region,” they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so that political risks increased throughout the region.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard operates in a manner similar to, for example, the Bulgarian National Guard, the constitution of which was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (UNB).
The constitution of the Bulgarian guard is due to the mass disturbances of the Gypsies that occurred in one of the neighbourhoods of Sofia (Krasna Poliana).
Taking advantage of this situation, UNB decided to constitute the guard, with the argument that the organization’s goal is “national self-defense”.
In his opinion, in the past 17 years there has been "Gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, however the state remained powerless and indifferent to the facts.
They added: this initiative has provoked a lively debate in Bulgarian public opinion.
As written, it indicates the increased risk of ethnic clashes that certain Gypsy organizations in Bulgaria have announced that, in order to resist, they will be their own guard.
Since the operation of the Hungarian Guard has so far shown similarities to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be ruled out that the Hungarian Gypsies also react to the threat in a similar way, organizing their own self-defense - can be read in the warning about the risks of the Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, director of research at the Political Capital, told the news agency that the risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, each year they publish their risk analysis and when they experience something that can influence the change of risk, they report to the public, as in this case, by publishing their risk warning.
The party is not always written with red numbers.
In Hungary, the law accurately defines the days that are written with red numbers on the calendar and has already become a widespread practice that around the holidays - which the next year will be less - workdays are reorganized.
Even in the EU or North America, the holidays are not uniform.
Hungarian laws make a difference between national holiday, state holiday and festive days.
The festive days are mainly related to religious festivals and historical ephemerals.
We also celebrate the New Year: both the last day of the old year, and the first day of the new year is festive - this last one especially so that those who spent celebrating the old year can rest.
Throughout the year we have eleven festivities written with red numbers on the calendar.
It is a national holiday on March 15 in memory of the revolution of 1848 and on October 23, commemorative day of the revolution of 1956.
On August 20 we celebrate the foundation of the State, on May 1 the feast of work, on November 1 and 2 we remember our deceased family and friends.
In addition, in our country there are two-day celebrations of the Passover of Resurrection, Pentecost and Christmas.
According to the calendar, our state, national or religious holidays rarely coincide with a weekend, which is why it is often done bridge when before or after the holiday there is only one working day.
In exchange for such extended weekends, during previous Saturdays you cannot be absent from work or school.
It is the Minister of Labour who regulates in his specific decree when it is necessary to work exactly in exchange for the day directly before or after the party.
This legal norm is mandatory for all employers and their employees, as well as for employees and public officials.
It is not mandatory in return for companies and services institutions that, because of their function, work continuously even during holidays.
This year the order of work can only be altered around the holidays of the end of the year: from December 24, life practically stops in the country, as according to experiences, most people "do bridge" during the days between Christmas and the end of the year or take their holidays during these days.
Next year several of our holidays will coincide with mid or weekends, so there will be fewer changes in working days than this year.
First, the agenda around the work party will be modified so that then, for four consecutive days, workers can rest.
On Saturday, April 26, it will be a working day, so that Friday, May 2 will be a festive day.
The other change relates to the October 23rd party: on Saturday 18th October, you will have to work instead of Friday 24th.
Instead, the year that comes during the end-of-year holiday will be able to rest, as from December 24 it will not work almost anywhere, even if the last day of the year is a Wednesday.
Six Small Deterrents to Bitter Your Colleagues’ Life
Emails we forget to send, sound messages we never received, innocent lies that happen to us without realizing: they are all part of our daily Folclore at work.
You have to decide whether to adapt to small discomforts or consciously avoid confusing situations that can irritate others.
Advice.
I'm sorry, I forgot to let you know that you've been called by the marketing department," says one of your colleagues.
That's why you didn't go on a date?
In the best of cases, feel it and try to fix the issue, better call the marketing department to tell them that you forgot to deliver the message to you (this is the least common solution).
Most of the time, the issue is resolved by apologizing.
Before proceeding to mouth-watering explanations, it is worth meditating on the things you can bitterly cherish your colleagues’ lives and consciously endeavor to avoid them.
Do you borrow something that is not yours?
There’s nothing more annoying than when you want to get a document, an office worker or your phone and you can’t find them.
Do you remember when you put the stapler on the table yesterday, but for this morning it disappeared?
Do you find your lost pen on the table of one of your colleagues?
Don’t take anything away from your colleagues without asking them, because they’ll be rightly angry with you for stifling their things.
Do not grab envelopes or post-it from the office because it may be unpleasant when you need them immediately and they get exhausted before time.
Are you joking about your colleagues’ privacy?
There is no good solution to stop rumors that are already running.
Who, what are you doing and with whom?
Where and why?
Don’t give everyone the information (conjectures) you have about your colleagues’ private life!
Don’t abuse your colleague’s confidence when he shares his most intimate secrets with you!
Bury in yourself what you have heard and don’t joke about your colleague in his absence, even if others know about him.
Are you going to leave for illness unjustly?
When you call the office on the phone and say that you’re sick and it hurts your head unbearably, you feel bad or good, you feel like you’d rather rest that day; think about what others should do your job, your unfathomable tasks, your work to end.
Don't bother your colleague!
If you already know in advance that the next day you will not go to the office or something will happen to you, so you should stay at home, communicate it, so that your colleagues or your boss do not have to face you absent the next day.
Tarareos, waste, phone calls
Are you involved in your work, but are you abruptly getting rid of the rubbish from your colleagues?
Have you unwittingly heard a phone conversation that would have been better not to listen to?
Don’t bother your colleagues with your tarraines, chants, loud conversations (less when you do them above their heads), flattery, constant blasphemy, expressing your dissatisfaction in a loud voice.
All of these can be annoying, even if they are not deepening at the moment in a project (writing, planning, organization).
Are you blaming others for a mistake?
Don't blame others if you haven't finished something in time, you forgot to send an important letter or message!
Don’t point to the eventual chaos in the office, or the noise your colleagues make!
You must recognize if you have made a mistake that harms others and you must repair the fault!
Ask how you can fix your shortcomings!
Do you feel too at home in the office?
Jogging and shoes: very comfortable habit for the house, but not suitable for the office!
Don’t watch a comfortable jogging even if your occupation allows it!
Don’t be messy, respect your colleagues and yourself wearing everyday clothes, elegant and beautiful when your occupation so demands!
Lose interest if you want to meet the expectations of the public
The car progresses slowly in the usual morning lockdown.
Sounds like a strange compass on the radio: violin with electronic effects.
Increase the volume.
Change the rhythm of the music and to the previous tones the bass is added and then the voice of a female choir as a real jewel intervenes.
The mr2 channel plays the song Wings of Love by Zagar.
The national music life did not spoil us much with quality electronic pop.
But now it looks totally different when you’re listening to Zagar’s new record.
A few new and interesting songs from the underground [b2]digital [b3]national are gradually changing the image and although the rock style garage, break guitars, the national electro pop has proven: there are new things under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started his career in the city of Pécs, played in the Yonderboi ensemble until he started his independent career perhaps because they can't both be protagonists of the same ensemble.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, a mix of jazz, danceable electronic music and pop, he tried to succeed, when he was asked for soundtracks [b4]cinematographics (pl.
(French Turkish Season).
The broader audience knew the ensemble that at first only played in small clubs when wan2 magazine selected its first album released in 2002 among the fifty most important national records, classifying Zagar, along with Yonderboi as almost the only national trend makers, capable of selling in Western markets as well.
There is no doubt that Zagar and his ensemble are fashionable, but no one has asked them if they wear this label or not.
The ensemble reacted as it should: it prepared a new and even better record.
The newly released record, titled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, will open new paths for them, although the title itself aims to establish continuity with the early years in the city of Pécs.
For this title was one of the lines of the old set of Balázs Zságer.
It's fine the reference to the airy, about the flight, but in addition to the airy of the music, now appeared - according to the spirit and trend of the time - the guitar that sounds strongest, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs he presented the album in the Millennials György Ligeti, the singer currently working in England with the set The Puzzle.
The record includes a true success of the mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi channel that recently broadcasts morning to night popular music. This broadcast brought to the ears of the radioyents the high-flying music of Wings of Love, recorded with six Hungarian singers (Divas Underground").
Everything is in order (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: After this new success, the question arises: what are you interpreting, to what extent is a music dedicated to a select audience?
Balázs Zs<0xC4><0x81>ger: The definition of select audience for me means little.
In my opinion there are two types of castes in light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Also so-called underground alternative music can be boring, meaningless and can be composed just for sale, which makes it commercial.
But also a good pop song can arise from a sincere inspiration.
The attitude of the listeners also works with this spirit, regardless of national languages and borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between receiving your music from the Hungarian and foreign audiences?
B. Zs: Abroad, especially to the west of us, light music has bigger traditions.
There not only the fifteen- and twenty-year-old generations attend concerts, but also the oldest.
They pay much more attention to the changes that occur around them in light music, because they consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Do you care who they are, where they come from, and how many people listen to your music?
B.Z.: Of course I feel good to see more and more people attend our concerts.
But we have never composed music for the market.
We do not compose music for any purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the audience is felt in concerts where there is reciprocal influence, but this is only in the unconceivable changes of the moment.
And yet, I realized that if you want to meet the expectations of the public, you lose interest.
hvg.hu: How far do you want to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He works alone and made his career rather west of us.
B.Z.: We don’t follow his path, even though sometimes they try to compare our music with his.
We work on a team, rely on the musical presence of the other and let it unfold.
At first it was inevitable to compare our work with Yonderboi’s music, as many of us started our career in his group and from there we embarked on another path.
hvg.hu: In the mr2 success list Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi Wings of Love is in first place.
Many people first heard the name Zagar in connection with this song.
Did you consciously open with this style to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We weren’t meant to compose great hits and sell our record with these hits.
This song is more than that.
We add it at the end of the disc, trying to relax after the sound orgy of the disc and the heaviest themes.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why just to them - what was the main reason?
B.Z.: The idea was to create a gospel-style choir.
Then came the idea of creating this choir of good voice soloists from our own national music scene.
This is how the choir of six women – Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik<0xC5><0xAB> Hodosi [Neo] and Juci Németh – was created, which was then baptized as Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you compose exactly that song or did the girls change some things?
Zs.B.: This song existed a long time ago in instrumental version and when we had all the material on the album, we thought something was still missing.
The chord attracted the singing.
That night I recorded the song that the girls later learned.
Everything came practically to the first attempt and in an incredibly spontaneous form.
I remember, I was very excited at the time, but of course I needed the Divas as well.
With my voice I would not have worked so hard.
hvg.hu: Both in the concert and on the album it looks like the girls were in the background.
There are no soloists (except for Judy Jay’s short solo), they don’t have their own role, they all sing together and not louder than music, so music doesn’t just accompany their songs.
They are also on stage in the background.
Intentionally?
B.Z.S.: They are in the background simply because of technical problems.
Instead, we consciously did not want to distribute soloist roles.
The song also verses about it, about the fact that we forget for a while our ego, who came from and where it goes, let those wings, the wings of love lift us up.
I would have liked to make others feel that euphoric mood that we felt when this song was born.
hvg.hu: Who did you dedicate more work to?
Zs.B.: In the musical composition to no one actually, rather when mixing there were more difficult pieces.
For example, the Dorian Gray's Dilemma in which I'm playing a concert piano or the Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time I didn't want the groove to work and then, gradually everything got in place like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song on the new album?
Zs.B.: This is constantly changing with the concerts and because I’ve already “solved” the record.
Now the Prophet Is A Fool, the Escape From The Earth and the Never The Same.
A treacherous stockbroker risks billions for its inferiority complex
A disloyal evildoer.
This is what his former employee, Jerome Kerviel, the French giant banker of Société Générale, also owns the Czech Trade Bank, points out.
He lost about <0x24>5 billion.
However, it seems more like Kerviel was a great player who wanted to compare himself to his colleagues and undoubtedly with good abilities.
Intuitively, unlike all major Czech banks, the crisis in the American mortgage market has long been intuitive.
"It has a fragile character," he said of his superiors, the same ones who sent him to the police.
But what comes out of Kerviel’s responses to French media outlets, such as Le Monde, is that he was a man who at the end of last year had a profit of more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.6 billion thanks to his business.
Crisis not only in America
“All I wanted to do was make money for my bank,” he said in his responses.
In the summer, he managed to win 500 million euros during the American crisis.
This opportunity has already seen it come at the beginning of the year.
In February, some news began to be heard about the so-called sub-prime mortgages offered to low-income clients or those who in the past had problems with payments and that those customers would start having problems.
However, this crisis should not affect the whole economy.
Kerviel did not believe it and put it right.
And then, at the end of the year, its profits exceeded <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.6 billion.
“When I gained my first 500 million I didn’t know how to notify him,” Kerviel confesses, adding that nothing has been left for him at all.
Throughout the interrogation, he stated that he had falsified the records in such a way that his discovery would not be reached.
He even fooled the bosses, even when the Eurex Stock Exchange began to take an interest in his business.
Risk has become a benefit
Were you afraid you would find out?
Rather, no.
“I thought I had earned <0x24>1.6 billion for the bank and that from that simple fact, that would make them happy.”
Where did he get so much willpower to take that risk?
In my position, I had to work gradually.
He joined Société Générale in 2000, exactly after graduating from Lyon.
His annual salary was <0x24>51,000.
Two years later he was already a stockbroker assistant and in 2005 he became a stockbroker with an annual salary of <0x24>90,000.
Still, I knew I was never going to win as much as the others.
“In my first interview in 2005, I already noticed that they were watching me carefully.
Because of my training and also my professional and personal progress," Kerviel described the researchers.
But shortly after my entry into the company came the first big success.
Thanks to Allianz’s actions, he won, during the bomb attacks in London, playing down a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>500 million title.
And this meant a boot mechanism, and he wanted more.
If you want to win, we leave you
"This is like a snowball," the police said.
But it is said that the bosses knew of all this or that they suspected it.
"While they made money, they closed their eyes."
Only then came the coup earlier this year.
In one day, he lost a billion euros.
After the weekend in mid-January he wanted to erase all footprints.
When he arrived at work on Monday, he was no longer working at the bank.
And two days later, the bank announced that it had lost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5 billion because of it.
And how did they find him?
He became a suspect after his vacation.
“I chose only four days for the past year.
The runner who has no holidays is a runner who doesn’t want anyone to take a look at his file,” Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic has a chance to reach 365 billion
The Czech government ministers signed with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programmes from which the Czech Republic can obtain <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14 billion (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>365 billion).
This is almost half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
Of the seven operational programmes, approximately 125 billion kroner will be issued for the regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain about 100 billion SEK from the Enterprise and Innovation Program.
Most of the money will be spent on transportation, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest of the operational programmes and represents up to 22 per cent of the resources that the Czech Republic can obtain from the fund.
This money increases the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have the amount of 90.8 billion kroner next year.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation program should serve entrepreneurs and businesses for the acquisition of resources in business innovation.
Companies should get funding for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for the implementation of more effective organizational methods.
As regards the current use of EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the newly admitted countries that use them less.
Twenty-year sentence for former president of Nicaragua, court ruled
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeals ruled on Thursday a 20-year sentence for the former president of the country, Arnaldo Alemán, who was sentenced in 2003 for the defamation of <0x24>100 billion (almost <0x24>1.8 billion).
Nevertheless, a time later, he was released from prison to go home arrest at his estate not far from the Nicaraguan metropolis.
Nothing is clear at this time, according to the AP agency, that the then head of the Central American state between 1197 and 2002 will be among the grids again.
According to the president of the Court of Appeals, Ileana Pérez, it will depend more on prison officers if they let the Germans finish their sentence at home or if they send him back to prison.
Four years ago, the court proved that the Germans were constantly transferring government money to the account of a company in Panama.
This society was fictional and the account belonged, in fact, to their closest relatives and supporters.
Part of this money ended up in the fund that Germany created to fund its campaign in the 2001 election.
This is how the budget was approved.
That's right.
The State Budget was approved.
Why is this budget so special?
It is the first developed by this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
This year’s budget was already approved with the support of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and <0xC4><0x8C>SSD could not afford to not accept it.
Apart from different debates before the vote on the vote of confidence in the government, this time nothing dramatic happened.
The parliamentary assembly, in this traditional view, although the most influential, has quietly adopted the new law.
It's a big paradox.
Each government starts and ends with each chapter and start of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an important part of politics but it hides the rivalry of power between the government and the opposition.
It is important for the media and therefore they pay special attention to it.
Political discussions are much more interesting than simple numbers.
The State Budgets of the last Social Democratic Governments suffered from three shortcomings that for this year 2008 cannot be solved so easily:
The first of these is the high participation of mandatory laws, called as the expenses of officials who are not only pensions but also social benefits that were already approved before the elections by the "silent" coalition of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and KS<0xC4><0x8C>M.
The second is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first deficit.
The third limit is the deficit of public funding, such as the municipal and Community budget deficit.
Despite this, the greatest risk is not in the state budget deficit.
It is public and relatively under control.
The clock pump, however, is in the municipal and community budget deficit.
Many mayors, in order to obtain other sources of investment, apart from the money from the banks’ taxes, taxes and credits, often issued, meaninglessly, bonds with which they owed disproportionately to their city councils.
In recent years, they have managed to pay off these debts through the mass sale of energy stocks and other development networks they received from the state and from privatization.
They do not currently have this resource.
If we adhere only to official and verified facts, we find that:
Our economy, already a few years ago, is undergoing phases of growth in the same way as the rest of the world, which is praised by <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
This was the ideal occasion for his government to put order on state finances.
Instead, however, the state continued to indebted itself.
The rest of the countries, with the exception of some such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have saved much more reasonably than our republic.
It is a great shame that falls, above all, in the previous government.
We belong to the nations that within global measures are less threatened by poverty.
That is why massive social programmes that unfortunately have been uselessly inflated in recent years with gigantic measures are not necessary.
And although they managed to eliminate some of the incomprehensible populist spending approved this year before the elections, if soon the retirement age and pension reform does not change then it will really be the end of any policy in this country and whoever governs it will only be a mere bureaucracy.
Exaggerating a little, we can say that politicians who govern will turn into civil servants, mechanical distributors of most of the money of pension and social benefits taxes.
That is why this year’s budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure of the normal expenses of the officials’ expenses.
The planned deficit of more than 70 billion for 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary if the past government hadn’t wasted what they could in the last ten years.
We do not want politicians who govern to become only officials, so we must be patient and give this weak coalition of governments, which realizes that the state can only spend what it is able to get from taxes and taxes, peace of mind for the preparation of other legislative reforms.
Only this will enable the gradual achievement of a balanced State Budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian Central Banks decided to fight together against the financial market crisis.
The monetary marking will receive more than <0x24>100 billion through tenders.
In these auctions, banks auction the interest rates for which they are able to lend money.
For example, the U.S. Fed will send <0x24>40 billion to tender, and then another <0x24>24 billion will be facilitated by central banks in Europe and Switzerland.
After the September 11 attacks, it is the first time central banks from different states have agreed on this coordinated process to protect and mitigate the consequences of the financial crisis.
“This step should solve the biggest economic problem, i.e. the continuous growth of the free capital shortage that banks could lend,” Bernard Baumohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group wrote in his report to customers.
“This coordinated action by central banks probably reduced the recession in the United States from 65 percent to fifty percent,” Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already spent <0x24>60 billion on unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Economists still expect billions in losses.
"Central banks must really be afraid of what awaits them even when they decide to take this step," ABN chief economist Kieran Davies said.
"It seems like the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks fear that they will have the same problems with access to loans and will therefore have to lend more expensive to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the U.S. economy into recession with different impacts on the global economy’s growth.
The central banks thus decided, after failing to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate that is used for money loans in the interbank market.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to lend money even when the Central Banks of the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom lowered their interest rates several times during the fall.
“It will have the same effect as another interest rate drop,” Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some economists are not surprised that the move taken by central banks helps spark the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem that is the fall of the US real estate market.
Klaus: The debates of ecologists are amazing
Global climate change affects developing countries in particular.
President Václav Klaus once again expressed his views on the issue of global warming.
Criticism has now emerged with the closing of the UN international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not a green planet, he commented that the debates of ecologists are incredible.
According to Klaus, it is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference that creates a strange mixture of government representatives and non-governmental organizations but the fundamental difference between the rhetoric being used and reality.
“There the debates are barely structured, they are artificial fires of words, substitutes for the solution to current problems,” Klaus said.
The Czech President during the presentation of his book stressed that this topic is very important to him and that is why he is interested.
He also expressed his joy at discovering his book translated into German because, as he said, “I often only encounter the caricature of my ideas.”
Interested parties can now get information about their varied opinions.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climatologist but that he has, in his opinion, enough assumptions to write a book like this.
He is an academic, with the ability to follow and judge a specialized dissertation, has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
At the main moment of the closure he expressed his thoughts that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, that on global warming there is no agreement among scientists, that the consequences of current changes are not so great and serious, nor represent possible disasters, and that attempts to influence the development of the climate are inextricably cost-effective.
Furthermore, as an experienced man with totalitarianism, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels as a dangerous way of limiting the freedom of others.
To the questions of the present, he repeatedly explained that he is not against "reasonable environmental advocates but against environmental activists who do not take into account the cost-benefit relationship."
Klaus spoke about the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayes Institute.
600,000 people failed to change their driver's license
Six hundred thousand drivers were given the date and therefore failed to change their old driving licence, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can apply for the change so that officials give them time until the end of the year to issue the new carnet.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after the New Year, hundreds of thousands of drivers will find themselves on the roads without a valid passport.
According to traffic, the car hasn’t changed it mainly those who don’t even want to drive anymore.
While in the villages they announce a rapid decline in carnival change, metropolitan offices are full of requests and interest in the new carnival has increased.
The City Council estimates about 2,000 daily customers.
A half hour is expected in the queues.
In Prague, about 140,000 drivers have not yet been removed.
The issuance of a new card lasts twenty days.
However, it is possible to request the issuance of the carnet within a shorter period of five days.
But in that case, the driver must pay 500 crowns.
Drivers who are required to change their passport and do not arrive by the end of the year, but will go out on the roads without the valid passport will be subject to a fine from January.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
The police can fix the offence with a warning.
In the event of an administrative offence, the fine will amount to 2,500 crowns.
According to the above information, a fine could be received by a person who is not going anywhere.
They could probably pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry appealed to the offices to incur moderate fines of a thousand crowns, up to a maximum.
According to transport ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka, the fine of a thousand crowns threatens no one.
According to him, a driver’s license is a document in which people can decide whether they want it or not.
It is not the identity card that every person must have valid.
People who do not want to drive should give their driver’s license.
Simply bring it or send it by certified mail to the municipal offices.
At the end of the year, carnations issued during the years 1964 and 1993 cease to be valid.
However, drivers will gradually have to change the other types of driving licences.
People with the document between 1994 and 2000 have up to three years to change it.
The validity of the card issued between 2001 and 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2.6 million more documents.
Court Reduced Penalty to Berdych Complicit Detectives
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Kon<0xC5><0x9B>a<0xC5><0x99>ík accused of complicity with criminal David Berdych will spend between thirteen and ten years in prison.
The Supreme Court of Prague decided as a definitive expiry the reduction of the penalties, the first to one year, and the second to two years.
The detectives in the department of Prague against organized crime were to fall, at first, between 14 and 12 years.
It is no longer possible to appeal against today’s decision, only by revocation by the Supreme Court.
Berdych is also charged in this case but he is waiting for the judgment of the Court of First Instance in the first place.
Despite this, in other trials he has already been sentenced to a total of 16 years.
You can't get any more.
In January, the District Court recognized the involvement in the assault of 19 people and the Supreme Court today revoked 16 of them.
Most of the accused’s allegations were rejected by the investigation for dealing with invented causes.
According to the central Bohemia senate, members of the police in agreement with Berdych passed information from police sources to the criminals, covered up the thefts, and helped the members of the criminal group avoid the penalties.
These criminals delivered 30 percent of their theft to Opava and Kona<0xC5><0x99>ík.
The prosecution refers to the criminal acts carried out by the group between 1999 and 2001.
As far as theft is concerned, their victims have suffered serious health impacts but are also accused of abuse of power as public agents and without a gun permit.
In the home registry, police found guns, steel core ammunition, a laser conductor and a machine gun.
The group of criminals, according to the prosecution, stole them tens of millions of crowns.
With the exception of nearly twenty men in this trial, the court has already found Berdych and other defendants guilty.
Other men related to the Berdych case are still declaring other trials, and in some cases have not yet appeared.
Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> P<0xC5><0xAF>t and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulej, who have so far avoided the trial, are in prison in Ireland where they await the final decision on their handing over to the authorities of the Czech Republic.
An account for changing some children: 12 million
For changing a child in the maternity home the lawyer of the affected families, Igor Veleba, wants from the hospital of T<0xC5><0x99>ebi<0xC4><0x8D> 12 million crowns of compensation plus the costs of the trial.
For each mother, three million, for parents, two million, and for children, one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dostál, does not in principle agree with Veleba’s proposal.
"As a demand we don't approve it, it's too high," Dostál said after today's meeting.
“In order for us to get an idea of this counter-proposition, we need the report of the specialist who commissioned the counterparty to investigate.
We'll find out if it has a rescission value.
We remain in the opinion that it will be hundreds of thousands for all,” Dostál said.
The amount should be between 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each parent.
At the beginning of the cause, Jablo<0xC5><0x88>’s family wanted, for each month that they did not raise their biological daughter, a million crowns.
Velaba was used as a basis for negotiating the compensation of the specialist's report, only that it was prepared at Motol's Faculty Hospital in Prague.
The girls’ parents, according to psychologists and psychiatrists, suffered from psychological impact and stress of different levels and depth.
The stress situation was better supported by men although they fought with recrimination for the change of girls.
Women are getting worse with the trauma they are currently experiencing and with respect to what is happening today, Veleba said.
Veronica and Nicola were changed by the nurses at T<0xC5><0x99>ebi<0xC4><0x8D>’s Maternity House last year, on December 9th.
Last week, the girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola and the <0xC4><0x8C>ermákovo and P<0xC5><0x99>íbyslavic, and Veronica and Libor Bro<0xC5><0xBE> and Jaroslav Trojanova in Jablo<0xC5><0x88>.
The governor of Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina, Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Vystr<0xC4><0x8D>il, delivered 100,000 crowns to each family at the end of October as compensation for the error in the hospital in T<0xC5><0x99>ebi<0xC4><0x8D> that the region administers.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured as liability for damages.
In case of errors they must extract from the backup fund and can exceptionally ask for help from the administrator.
The court has so far recognized them a proportionately low compensation, the sums calculated according to the tables counting in hundreds of thousands and extraordinaryly one million crowns.
Polivka lost the kingdom of Valaquia
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the brand Kingdom of Wallachia.
According to the judge of the provincial court of Ostrava, he was the first to use the brand Kingdom of Valaquia but the project was created for many years by Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> with whom the actor collaborated.
Polivka did not appear at the oral hearing today.
According to your lawyer, the case is probably not over and your client will appeal.
“The dispute is that Mr. Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team are parasites of Bolek Polivka’s popularity,” Polivka’s lawyer said after the trial.
For him, before the words Kingdom of Valaquia, everyone comes to the image of the actor and comedian.
The same idea has Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> as well.
“We’ve been working for about ten years.
Searching for money and inventing activities,” he said.
For him, the cause of the dispute is money.
“After years I have realized that the project is successful and that for that reason I could receive something as well.
They want to live like parasites from our work,” he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court the brand Kingdom of Valaquia was first used by Polívka in his television program.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohaty.
Then it was not about guiding him towards the creation of a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> was asked to edit the passport of the Kingdom of Wallachia.
From that comedic origin resulted a business and a lucrative business activity from which Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> later created the company Kingdom of Valaquia.
In 1997, Polivka agreed to use her name and signature on passports and even offered her owners discounts to visitors to her farm and attendees to her shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also ruled today that Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> only used a simple idea that Polivka made public on stage for its own business benefit.
“It is clear that Bolek Polívka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Wallachia,” the judge said.
He added, however, that in the spirit of the project is Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team who fully devoted themselves to it.
The collaboration, between today’s decomposed parties, continued until 2000 when Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> organized for Polivka the official coronation in Vsetín.
From that moment there began to be conflicts between Polivka and Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, whose culmination came with the overthrow of "King Boleslav I, the chosen forever".
The main role in the kingdom, through the mediation of Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, derives from the singer Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>ulaková, as mother queen.
In 2002, Polivka filed an indictment against Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his society, which has so far been rejected by the court.
Something clear could bring in the litigation, the tournament for the throne with her princesses, who is already preparing Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
The new king should come out of him.
He hasn't wanted to reveal any more data or dates yet.
"We're not in a hurry.
It would have to be something like the king's way to Moravia.
The king would have to be elected on a specific date.
Even Mr. Polívka can present himself,” Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: prejudices overcome
I never really liked the Peugeot 206.
Its running characteristics were never anything special, the quality of the gearbox, maneuver and also the product could be characterized as below average.
But now there is in the market its successor, the Peugeot 207, and this one is much better.
This Combi called SW is a little more advanced and for me, I just have to think about it better.
When I tried the classic Peugeot 207 five doors, I complained, for example, of the space of the headrest in the rear seat.
But this would be the only complaint because the Combi’s bodywork means in this sense, that I will not suffer from the two meters of length.
Flying around the world
I pass through the interior quickly so as not to repeat it too much.
This is an elegant design where the only flaw is the poor central tunnel.
Here the design invention would be more appreciated even though the car already looks pretty stylish.
The seats are comfortable, there are times when we complained about short seats and backs.
Also unlike the model 206, the lateral steering has improved considerably.
And space?, and here you can feel how the body measurements have grown.
In the Combi disappears the mentioned space scarcity in the header.
Bags in the suitcase
But the main thing in this vehicle is your trunk.
This should be valued as very accessible (thanks to the removable rear gate) and a well-distributed storage.
Dead spaces are equipped with rubber straps that represent an ideal solution.
They do not bother, and can be extended to the point of holding heavy objects.
But let's stay in the warehouse.
According to the tables, in basic mode it has a capacity of 428 liters which compared to the competition is rather an average value.
But not compared to the same type of vehicle best-selling in the Czech Republic, the <0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mladá Boleslav model, we find that the Peugeot remains at the forefront with its perceptible 52 litres.
From vacation abroad or when placing the child's cart its value is critical.
But if I had to comment on something positive then I have to quote the floor that remains pretty flat after the second line backing down.
120 horses in four gears
Our car tested was equipped with a four-valve injection ignition over a capacity of 1.6 l. and a force of 88 kW.
And to be honest, that’s what a 1600 should look like that would underestimate the five-door family.
It is quiet, consumes little and above all, it has impulse.
If I compare it to the times of the skoda of that time that looked like the exhaust pipe was covered by a trap, I can say that with it I can be impressed.
The prices respond
The price of the car is not for all pockets.
We must, however, keep in mind that we have tested an elegantly equipped vehicle and with a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with injection ignition of 1400 for 329,900 kroner, can still be.
Our aggregates put it from 410.900 SEK, which is already too much.
The tested Premium type already reaches another 80,000 crowns.
Only we would still have airbag in the headers, automatic air conditioning, automatic windshield cleaners, automated rear windows...
That is, the car with everything, costs 531,900 kroner.
It’s a lot, but have the team add-ons on the Fabia and it’ll get to a pretty similar number.
It remains to be decided which of the two brands.
Slovak students are not integrated into English schools
In English schools, children from Eastern European countries attend and, therefore, locals fear more changes in schools.
The integration of the Eastern Europeans for now only brings a number of problems.
Even British schools record cases where conflicts between immigrants and children of the natives increase in violence.
The problem of the integration of Eastern European children into British schools is well illustrated in the northern city of Kent, where conflicts between natives and Slovak immigrants begin to grow.
Discussions, extortion, and bullying among students have already reached even the parents themselves.
The situation has come so far that the Chatmam police arrested a Slovak woman who was picking up a ten-year-old student with a green stick.
In her defense, she said the girl was insulting her son with racist tone insults.
The police had to act also after an attack by two minor girls against a Slovak emigrant.
The girls gifted him with racist insults and threw stones at him.
“When we were going home, a boy approached us at the bus stop and began to spit on us.
When I told him to leave it, he made us throw apples and pears, and then he took off his pants and showed us his ass,” another unpleasant incident described to The Times, the Slovak student’s mother.
Complaints are from both sides.
One of the natives even designated the conflict with the emigrants of Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The above-mentioned cases show us how the environment in English schools starts to be quite tense.
In the UK there are 70,000 Slovaks enrolled who came here for work.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors it is really the island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your holidays can be accomplished, as long as you choose correctly.
Sandy and golden beaches, large waves or a quiet sea like a pond.
the palm trees and the whole included with waiters offering pizzas on the beach, ice cream or varied cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the island of the Caribbean you can find all this and much more.
Only on one island finds much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of all the islands of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba became the stronghold of the conquest of America.
Columbus called it, the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and cargo port for the treasures that the Spaniards extracted from America and brought to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The National Hotel grew in the late 1920s.
He was commissioned to build one of the chiefs of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, as everything about crime in the United States (and therefore, banned) was welcomed and supported in Cuba as drugs, gambling and prostitution.
Among his guests were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
High buildings emerged in Havana, along wide avenues ran cars that were a symbol of worship in the 1950s.
Ernest Hemingway bought a hacienda in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojimar he had his yacht.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, the stars of the show world and politicians of all America left their signatures.
What about today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita you can also leave your autograph.
At the bar of the expensive Hotel Nacional you can mix cocktails according to your wishes.
And those cars already from the 1950s, still operate in Havana, because those Lada and Fiat who arrived long ago have oxidized between these wet and salty winds.
Even though Havana, especially the old neighborhood is deteriorating noticeably, there are not as many wonderful colonial monuments in the surroundings as there.
Other places are metamorphosed in beauty, for example, Trinidad.
Because tourism brings so much money needed, its development is guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is unique in the world and is highly valued by railway lovers.
The sugar cane is transported from huge plantations to sugar factories by narrow paths in steam or electric machines.
Their carriages for decades have not been discovered and now they are there, machines that work and whose sibling models that are elsewhere in the world are only found in museums.
Where to go?
The most famous place for most visitors does not change.
And for that reason, there is no need to talk more about Havana or Varadero.
Perhaps, just remember that in the already mentioned Hemingway estate there is a museum that for those who are writer lovers, should not stop visiting it.
The Viñales Valley is the most picturesque corner of Cuba to the west of the island.
Exuberant vegetation that grows in limestone land.
Mogotes, limestone pebbles and rocks of high cliffs in the falls of the valley, and in their caves fertile lands are acclimatized thanks to which rocky valleys form that hide dense vegetation.
The valley is the place where the highest quality tobacco in Cuba is probably grown.
Visiting any of the pure habaneras factories you can find your final product.
Maybe someone finds it interesting that there was the Chilean part of the series, Mayor Zeman.
Trinidad
The old town of Abolengo was founded not long after the Spanish colonized the island.
Slavery and sugar brought her fame and wealth.
Wealth became beauty with the constructions in the small town.
Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by the French settlers who arrived later, has barely changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Sierra de Escambray, is a place so remote that still in the 1950s there was no road that would unite it with the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped her stay out of the rest.
Nothing new was built and therefore nothing was destroyed, because each person was happy to have a place to live.
If you have more time to stay in Trinidad than a single afternoon, it is worth exploring interesting places in the surroundings such as Ancon Beach or the sugar mill valley.
The night belongs to the House of Music, which with its music animates the silence of the mornings.
Baracoa
A small town in the western end of Cuba, some consider it the most beautiful on the island.
Surely this opinion is already confirmed by the way.
The two roads that get there from Guantanamo must pass through high and broken mountains, as well as through a nature that barely knows the action of man.
This eastern place of Cuba has been inscribed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO thanks to its intact nature.
There they make the best chocolate, in their church they have the cross of Columbus (in fact it is a cross that came 100 years later from the landing) and from the hill, where the castle was located and now there is a hotel with the same name, you can see the mountains and among them the most famous, the Yunque.
Coffee, ron, pure, the Sierra Maestra, the Cochins Bay and the island of Pinos, the Tropical Cabaret, the patroness of Cuba, the Virgen de la Caridad del Cobre, the Santería, the African religion that the descendants of those slaves practiced, of all of this many pages could be filled.
However, as they say, it is better to see it ever.
Allies are passive in Afghanistan, Americans say
Few soldiers and insufficient equipment needed are what is influencing the progress of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates, should design a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not working as expected, the representatives of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh (Scotland).
At the same time as conflicts with the Taliban are growing, today, the eight participating states are discussing the plans and coordination of the allies.
While the United States this week through its defense minister, Robert Gates, encouraged NATO forces to step up, Britain sees strengthening the Afghan government’s authority and the allocation of development aid as a priority.
“The development in Afghanistan is palpable, but the armed forces can only be one of the solutions.
The next is to enable the population to begin economic and security development alone,” Defence Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
The Ninety percent
Afghan rebels’ activity, according to U.S. military data, is higher than in the past five years.
The number of violent actions grew by 27 percent compared to last year, and in Helmand province up to 60 percent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, of which a quarter are in the south of the territory.
However, for the United States, the allies have reached the same limit as for the organization and equipment of the units.
They are demanding more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
“We will have to think seriously about concrete goals for the future and how we will achieve them,” Gates said.
In a similar sense, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop spoke today.
“I’m not happy to know what we have on earth and in heaven in Afghanistan.
We have 90 percent of soldiers and equipment we would need, and that’s little,” De Hoop told Reuters at the closing of the three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
In recent months, there has been a controversy over whether all the allies are doing their best in Afghanistan.
For passive was criticized, for example, Germany.
“The Germans have a relative number of replacements in Afghanistan.
But they’re in a zone of minimal violence and the demands for fighting there aren’t as high as ours, in the south and east of the country,” Gates said.
The sensationalist Sun newspaper this week called the German soldiers vacant.
"Afghan rebels discover that the Germans are dedicated to playing while our boys are fighting," Sun wrote in a material accompanied by photographs of German soldiers playing table tennis.
German Bild responded to the attack and posted a photo of the British troops playing a rugby game in southern Afghanistan.
State debt will reach <0x24>1 trillion in 2009
For each Czech, the state owes 84,000 crowns.
Total debt in September amounted to SEK 842.7 billion.
This year the government planned to lend 159.2 billion crowns.
At the beginning of December, however, the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns thanks to the improvement of the state budget economy.
The Czech Republic's state debt grew at the end of September to 842.7 billion crowns.
In nine months this year it increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
However, since June it decreased by 13.4 billion crowns.
Today, the Ministry of Economy confirmed its data on the state’s debt at the beginning of October.
For each cheque, the debt corresponds to 84,000 crowns.
Over the past year, the state owed more than 111 million crowns.
“For now it seems that thanks to next year’s low deficit we could cross the billion-dollar border by 2009.
Next year, the debt should move between 900 billion and a trillion kroner,” Patria Finance economist David Marek told iHNed.cz.
Next Finance economist Vladimir Pikora said: “We could spend billions in 2009.
Exactly when that will depend on the next budget we do not yet know.
If the situation on the political scene is seen to change and politicians are able to save, then it could be delayed to 2010.
But I don't see such a change," he added.
Doubt is growing
State debt creates debt in the central government and arises, above all, from the accumulation of the deficit of the state budget.
State debt is paid through Treasury bonds, government bonds, direct credits or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state’s domestic debt grew this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
External debt has so far grown from SEK 1.7 billion to SEK 123.3 billion.
The so-called negotiable state debt at the end of September contained 803.3 billion z kronor since June reduced by 13.7 billion kronor.
The average maturity of the state debt increased by 6.5 years.
“The total annual debt from the first to the third quarter creates 13 percent which is huge given how the economy works.
It is interesting that growth is generated mainly from bonds where there is a 20 percent growth.
It is bad that the debt grows but on the other hand it shows that it is going to be negotiated until there is a pension reform," Pikora said.
Better than expected
The state debt management and payments strategy for 2007 suggests that the government planned to lend 159.2 billion crowns this year.
In early December, the ministry reduced the plan by 152.8 billion crowns thanks to improved developments in the state budget.
The amount consists, above all, of the state budget deficit that this year will be 76 million kronor instead of the planned 91.3 billion kronor.
The remainder is made up of maximum resources planned for the Czech Consolidation Agency with about SEK 13.3 billion, the reserve of SEK 10 billion for the payment of pensions, SEK 43 billion to finance state liabilities and SEK 1.8 billion in loans from the European Investment Bank.
Compare today before a court in Jartúm for giving a name to a peluche bear
The British professor convicted in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced Thursday afternoon by a court in Jartum to 15 days in prison and expulsion, her lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of letting students aged 6 to 7 give the name of Muhammad to a peluche bear when any representation of the Prophet of Islam is illegal.
He was passible of a penalty of laziness.
This 54-year-old British school teacher in office at the Unity High School in Jartum in Sudan, has been detained at her home on Sunday and accused of attacking Islam and sedition, under article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, as a result of several complaints from parents of their students.
The story goes back to the month of September, when this teacher asks her students, aged 6/7, to choose a name for the peluche bear of the class.
“Eight names come from the mouths of children, such as Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed,” says school director Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a class vote, 20 children out of 23 have chosen Mohamed as their preferred name.
Mohammed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Then the kids made a book for the class with the picture of the bear with the following legend "My name is Mohammed ".
The bear himself - himself did not bear any labels with this name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons’ Muslim colleagues, a professor at the same school in Sudan, said he knew her well and that he would never have done anything that could be insulting to a religious faith, “I’m sorry I just asked children to vote for a name,” he said.
Opinion shared by numerous schoolteacher pupils who describe it as " very attentive to their pupils " and " never speaking of religion in class " ..
Remember that the name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Britain, it is written in English in 14 different modes.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the Prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this name?
Can we give it to a toy?
It is, of course, a matter of interpretation.
They did not reach an agreement on Wednesday on the future status of the province, during the last negotiating session in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
The Serbians and Albanians of Kosovo ended on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, a sixth and final session of discussions without being able to overcome their divergences on the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the status," European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
Emphasizing that peace in the region was " at stake " , his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their efforts to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
"We do not anticipate violence for the time being, but we are entering a very difficult period," he added, noting that " evident tensions exist " .
End of Mediation on 10 December
The mediators of the Troika, which brings together the European Union, the United States and Russia, will go to Serbia and Kosovo for the last time on Monday.
The future of the 90%-populated Albanian province could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko return their relationship to the UN Security Council by December 10.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and final session of negotiations since the Troika was commissioned for a new UN mediation last August.
Americans and Europeans believe their mediation will end on December 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence in Kosovo in the Security Council, insist on pursuing negotiations beyond this deadline.
"Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," said Botsane-Khartchenko.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of UN administration in Kosovo, Westerners consider independence under the supervision of the European Union to be the only viable solution.
Pristina feels ready to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not resolve in its favour.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been found," the president of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced at the hotel in Baden where these "last chance negotiations" had been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, has given part of his weights.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade “belonged to a past that has led to murders and deportations.”
" Domino Effect "
Serbian President Boris Tadic considered that a commitment was always feasible, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province's independence.
Belgrade expresses particular concern for a " domino effect " in a region still weakened by the 1990s wars of independence.
"For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a commitment is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision should belong exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has a veto right.
" The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word "
" Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia," said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
“These negotiations have lasted two years.
They must end up as they have begun: in the Security Council. "
To the journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had responded that " the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status " , adding that any unilateral declaration of independence on the part of the Albanians would be made " in consultation " with the Westerners.
Bush launches Israeli-Palestinian deal
President George Bush announced during the opening of the international peace conference he met on Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately start negotiations with a view to finding a definitive settlement of the 60-year-old litigation point between his two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised that he would do anything to help them conclude a “peace treaty” by the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must dismantle " terrorist infrastructure " and Israel must end its colonization activities, Bush said, recalling both sides ' obligations with respect to the peace itinerary they accepted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would seek " to conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues " .
This designation covers the three main pilgrimage problems of the Israeli-Palestinian litigation point: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees expelled from their homes during the 1948 conflict.
Taking the word after the US president, Abbas insisted that the forthcoming negotiations be "global and deepened" and refer to all aspects of a regulation, citing "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things".
As Olmert returned to the tribune, he pledged to make the forthcoming negotiations “direct and continuous” and to make “an effort to conclude them in the course of 2008.”
At the end of 2008, Mr. Bush set an end to his " two-state vision " of Palestinian and Israeli co-existence.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had made a commitment in this regard from Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the beginning of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, that proposes peace to Israel in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a point of confrontation in the history of the Middle East, more particularly because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," Prince Saoud said in an Arab newspaper interview with Saudi capitals.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened, last Sunday?
As always in this type of events, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to early investigations by the French National Police Inspectorate General (IGPN), a police car was circulating on Sunday, shortly after 17:00, rue Luisa-Miguel, in Villiers-le-Bel.
"I was not in intervention but in patrol, and circulated at 40-50 km/h, without a rotating headlight," a police source said.
A Kawasaki green motorcycle, " not approved, or not authorized to circulate on the public road " (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, circulated " all-gas " .
"He hit the police car on the left side, after a breach of the pass to the right," the police said.
Alcohol control practiced on vehicle occupants turned out to be negative.
The condition of the car (the broken front, cracked windshields, kick-off shocks) bears witness to the shock violence.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the Prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that he had entrusted an investigation for "accidents of involuntary murder and denial of assistance " to the IGPN, co-ordinated with the Department of Public Security of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor stated that the IGPN investigation, at this stage, discarded the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, understood Sunday afternoon, confirmed "the version of the police, knowing that this mini-motorcycle arrived relatively quickly to their left " .
Yesterday, a type of slot, undoubtedly caused by the frozen footwear on the floor, showed that both vehicles had been framed in time for the police car to come to brake.
Vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of both victims were autopsyd yesterday.
What happened just after that?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circulated through Villiers-le-Bel, according to which policemen would have left the site very quickly, thereby not providing assistance to both young people.
The IGPN, being cautious, would also remove " any serious shortcoming " on this point.
"It is the most difficult aspect of the investigation, which needs more investigation, over which you have to be very cautious," a police source said.
Liberation found an eyewitness of these few moments that have followed the accident.
One of its windows that precisely gives the scene.
“Let’s go down immediately, with my cousin who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to revive them,” said the witness.
There was nothing to do."
Then he saw “a policeman who was completely exhausted, who was crawling.
Two others were trying to revive one of the young men, the fourth was talking on the phone.”
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and seemingly certain that the people present from the unexpected situation of the young people, the police have been taken by car by colleagues who had arrived at the site.
According to this witness, the rescues arrived “about twenty minutes after the police marched.”
They also practiced cardiac massages, in vain.
" I will not let it be assumed that the police services did not provide assistance to young people.
These young people have been rescued.
The firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything has been done to try to save them,” the prosecutor said.
Tension Rises in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday suppressed the first demonstrations since the establishment of the state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers protesting against measures taken under the state of emergency have been wounded by tear gas grenades used by law enforcement, witnesses say.
The latter replicated with stone shots, hurting policemen.
At least 350 lawyers have been interviewed.
Similar scenes to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police loaded and injured lawyers.
Many would have been interviewed.
In Islamabad, the Supreme Court’s lawyers called for a general strike and announced demonstrations as a result of a wave of about 500 detentions over the weekend of opposition, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets that gave access to the Supreme Court were blocked on Monday morning to prevent the grouping.
Other demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (centre) and in Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyers' movement on Monday gathered support from religious parties regrouped in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance whose president " urged the population to send flowers to judges who voted against the state of emergency and the waste they swore before Mufsha.
" Musharraf's promise is no longer fulfilled "
The Pakistani Supreme Court refers directly to the exception measure proclaimed on Saturday afternoon.
He had to speak in the coming days about the legality of the re-election to President Musharraf’s presidential election, on 6 October, in the indirect suffrage.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been removed and replaced.
“Everything we attend is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court’s rulings,” the magistrate told The News.
Pervez Musharraf’s promise to leave the army’s head and become a civilian president “is no longer valued” after the state of emergency was established, Assistant Minister of Information Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to leave his military uniform by November 15, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The Assistant Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government denounced insistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf had been assigned to residence by his deputy army chief.
More than a third of pregnancies remain unforeseen
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unexpected births.
Still today, more than one in three (36 percent) pregnancies are not expected, according to a study conducted by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote on the Neuwirth law that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unexpected births.
Different methods of contraception such as the pill or the sterile still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, Ined estimates.
However, the liberalization of contraception allowed a better “domination of fertility,” according to the institute noting that the rate of use of the pill among women aged 20 to 44 has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Eight births out of ten would be well planned today.
Even calculated little more or less a month for a couple out of every five and if possible for spring, season judged as the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crew members from the International Space Station (ISS) will need more than seven hours of work in space to perform the spectacular repair of a broken solar panel that is essential for the continuation of the station’s scientific activities.
A risky exit that accumulated the records because of its duration, its distance from the habitable modules, the speed with which it has been imagined, instruments "captured" by the astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem arose on Tuesday when astronauts had released the Harmony module, a cylindrical thick piece in charge of hosting European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a type of landing anden for laboratory modules.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move a power generation module with solar panels weighing 17.5 tons, already present in the ISS, in order to put it in its final position.
After moving it, the crew began reorganizing the module's solar panels with a width of 76 meters.
And that’s where one of the panels, which deploy as accordions, has been damaged in just over a meter by a wire that clamped.
The deployment has been stopped to no longer damage the panel.
Astronauts, who initially had to make a check-out of the Discovery launcher, and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged panel.
And it is Scott Parazynski who has been chosen to go to swing at the end of the 30 meters length of the teledirected arm of the launcher added to the station to carry out the repair.
It is one of the best spacewalkers in NASA.
High, tough, very skilled, has the very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this training doctor has been tasked with "operating" the "wounded" solar panel.
After precisely inspecting the damages, he cut the faulty cable and installed types of "tablets" in the damaged area.
He had been assisted by the second " spacewalker " who had stayed near the airlock and, from within, by other astronauts such as Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini hockey baton wrapped with insulator to avoid electrocuting in solar panels that produced several hundred volts, has been conceived and "pushed" by astronauts aboard the station.
Once the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before making the inventory of his instruments and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts were taking advantage of a lunch break before today, seven astronauts return from the Discovery launcher for a return to Earth scheduled for Wednesday.
The EADS title sanctioned in the stock market
EADS share is currently in sharp decline on the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aeronautical and defence group announced it had to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to cope with the delays of the A400M.
EADS is currently losing 4% at 21.96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group has been forced to review its forecast of the operational result for 2007 in response to delays caused by the slow progression of the development of the A400M engine, which conditioned the aircraft's inaugural flight.
The cost to alleviate the delay in the delivery of the military transport aircraft, announced in October, is "between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than 1 billion for Airbus," the European manufacturer's parent company EADS announced.
Due to these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new EBIT targets for 2007 during the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, it adds without any further encrypted precision.
The group also indicates that the estimate of new loads is consistent with the six-month delay.
It should be borne in mind that EADS’ operational result failed by 86% in 2006, mainly due to burdens linked to the delays of another programme, that of the very thick carrier A380.
Initially, the group anticipated a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of status quo
No surprise on Sunday, at the exit of the polls: the Russians will massively opt for President Putin’s party, united Russia.
Confirming his aspiration for stability, even authoritarianism, after a very limited campaign.
Three days after the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin is addressing voters today a televised message on public channels, already registered but whose content is kept secret.
It does so as the leader of the list for the united Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory turns out to be overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president left nothing to be transparent by receiving foreign ambassadors, contenting himself with delivering a new charge against the West accused of interference - his favorite theme during the campaign.
"We know the price of a true democracy and we wish for honest, more transparent and more open elections, elections without incidents," he added.
According to the opposition, we are far from the truth.
It denounces a pressurized campaign.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that "there has never been such a dirty election, even in the time of Eltsin".
After the repression of the demonstrations last weekend, former world champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, visits are prohibited, according to his lawyer.
"The Russians kept the mentality of the Soviet homo"
Behind these unsurprising legislative elections there are two much more open questions:
Who will succeed Putin in the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot apply for the third consecutive term.
Then no successor emerges.
What role will Putin play after March?
The Prime Minister?
Head of the parliamentary majority and the very powerful united Russia party that would elect the government and the president?
Whatever it is, in the legislative and presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
“Russians have kept the mentality of the homo sovieticus, they do not feel they own their destiny,” says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent center Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov, from St. Petersburg State University, goes further: civil society was delayed in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, “Putin restored the model of a paternalist state, perfectly accepted by the population as this new paternalism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic unrest,” said Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians " voluntarily give up the personal responsibility " of those who had briefly proved themselves after the outbreak of the USSR.
"Why to reflect?"
The phenomenon touches all social layers, including the world of affairs.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (of every 85 heads of Russian regions) lead the local lists of United Russia.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The opinion prefers stability.
The Russians will not vote for extremists either.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, 54-year-old professor: "What to reflect?
Those in power aren’t too bad, why change them?”
A Heavy Memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, describing the fate of the 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are freely accessible.
The 47 million documents of archives, stored over 27 km of shelves to Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were not so far consultable only for a "humanitarian" purpose, that is, individually and nominally, at the request of a former victim or its right-holders.
The eleven states in charge of its management – such as Germany, France, Israel and the United States – agreed in May 2006 to open them to seekers and historians.
Since the process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed, the opening is effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow searches "particularly on the displacement of prisoners, the population of the camps and the health status of forced workers," explains Reto Meistern, director of these files managed by the International Commission of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, such as Germany, objected to the opening to the public of these nominative documents, due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
As well as the alleged homosexuality or the mental handicap of certain victims of deportation.
The records of the concentration camps or the detention orders established by the Gestapo had been collected after the war for a practical purpose: to find the deported or subject to compulsory labour and, eventually, to provide them with proof of their detention, in order to open the way for their compensation.
Still today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees deal with tens of thousands of individual requests.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
“There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents,” Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Center for Research on Anti-Semitism at the Technische Universität Berlin, said in 2006.
The European Union and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, bilateral Indo-European trade already reaches around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion per year.
The European Union is India’s first trade partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India expect to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath said.
The foreign ministers of the European Union had given their approval last April to the European Commission to begin negotiations with a view to signing free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The European Union is India’s first trade partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
LEU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the 9th trading partner of the European Union, according to figures from the European Commission.
“A free-changing pact will do much to both economies” and “India would improve its entry into a prosperous market of 450 million Europeans,” Peter Mandelson said.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, said the European Commissioner. The Asian and European giants exchanged annually for "47 billion euros of goods" and for "four billion euros of services ", had said this week Mr Manamero, the president of the European Union, and Mr Manamero Smadja, the president of the European Union, said in a statement.

Bank of England Takes Note of Concerns by Offering <0xC2><0xA3>10 Billion in Five Weeks
The Bank of England on Thursday was concerned about easing the current round of credit conditions concerns, and announced an offer of <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion at the base rate of 5.75% in five weeks, an offer of unusual duration.
" In order to alleviate the concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty about how they will organise their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its expected reserve contribution during a five-week market maintenance period, indicating a six-week maintenance period. "
The bank specifies that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed on the market on December 6 at 12:15 GMT, at the base index and until January 10.
It is the first time that the Bank of England BoE put liquidity on the market for five weeks in an open market operation.
These are usually done in a week.
The BoE adds in its statement that " it is ready to take other measures to keep interbank lending rates on a daily basis in line with its baseline index.
The interbank index per day was 5,829 % on Wednesday.
The index after three months was set at 6.6%, the highest since September 18.
Since the start of the summer financial crisis, the sums put on the market by the Bank of England have been combined with a major penalty index that had deterred banks from resorting to that.
According to certain rumors, corroborated by the evolution of the pound exchange in relation to the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the sums brought to the market by the European Central Bank, to the most advantageous indices and with a more secure discretion.
UMP and NC parties deny review of PS party proposals on purchasing power
The UMP group and Nouveau Centre refused on Thursday to discuss articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which is equivalent to a rejection of the text.
Inscribed in a socialist "niche" (session for the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined about a dozen measures adopted Tuesday by the national office of the PS including the increase of 50% of the overpayment for employment, the restoration of the TIPP (internal rate for petroleum products), or a floating check-transport.
Since UMP and NC have voted against the review of the articles (180 votes against 115), the session has been raised at the end of the general discussion that led to, sometimes live, exchanges between majority and opposition to a few hours of Nicolas Sarkozy’s televised intervention on purchasing power.
PS MP leader Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the integrity of its proposals in the form of amendments to the draft amendment to the Finance Act that the Assembly will consider next week.
A new festival is coming to light
As a result of numerous rumors regarding the creation, by C3 Presents, of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with the Festival Republic of British producer Melvin Benn.
"For our company, it's an honor to work with a person who inspired, neither more nor less, the current movement of festivals in America," Charlie Jones of C3 told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer camping destination.
The festival will take place from August 8 to 10 on a private farm of 500 acres approximately 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Once known as Mean Fiddler, the director of the Festival Republic, Melvin Benn, is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he led the UK Reading Festival, which attracts some 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio then, in 2006, the Republic Festival created the Henham Park Latitude Festival at Suffolk.
Since 2002, as a co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for production, licensing and organizing the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Qualifying Glastonbury as the "most inspiring event" he's ever attended, C3's Charlie Jones says his company and Melvin Benn work in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
“We had chosen Philadelphia as a market and worked with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia,” says Charlie Jones.
"We were in negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about this project.
“Unfortunately, we have stalled in low-class policies because of the current administration,” said Charlie Jones.
Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and prepare to create a magnificent festival at an exceptional site that has recently taken place in Philadelphia.
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at Chicago's Grant Park, after demarcating itself on the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded respective gross revenues of <0x24>9.8M and <0x24>11.3M in 2007.
These two festivals take place in an urban environment.
"Melvin Benn's European model is a country festival, while ours are performed in urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
The goal is to merge, in one way or another, both formulas to give at the same time an impression of a country festival in the European and urban way in the American way.”
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the celebration of this event,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but states "that they are quite interesting to allow to invest in such an event and host a festival that, we expect, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the hotel offer of this festival is "very large", for example the 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says invitations have been issued to the groups, but that nothing could yet be confirmed at the time of going to the press.
“Vineland will taste rock, but the music will be varied there, hoping to attract all kinds of viewers,” says Charlie Jones.
His C3 colleagues, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award at the latest Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faced Terminator
It’s not easy to attract Hollywood movie dishes to Montreal when nothing but Terminator opposes that...
This seduction mission is part of the functions of the delegate.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because California's governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the "runway productions".
Is it difficult to compete with the "Governor"?
“You have to be careful, it’s the industry that decides where it goes.
If you find that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, you are going there.
Our role is to offer those who will judge the best,” he says.
The race to the festivals
For now, Denis Turcotte’s priority is the promotion of cinema here.
The race to the Oscars has begun.
All West Coast festivals, whether in Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will have to present Quebec films, give them value and make sure that the filmmakers do interviews.
The Age of Darkness had a good picture at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on display in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally in the stock market? The experts, divided by the 'subprime' crisis.
Less than five weeks to say goodbye to the closing of the exercise, investors are already rubbing their hands waiting for the traditional end-of-year rally to arrive.
However, this year the experts are not so clear that this is going to happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, December in the stock market usually has a positive behavior.
However, forecasts should not be made based exclusively on statistics, even more so because in the current context, uncertainties aggravate the markets, at least in the short term.”
While they are not in favour of the stock market taking to the streets in the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that “the stock market is sustained by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the leakage effect to quality values both in the long and short runs.”
Therefore, they believe the stock exchange will have a rather lateral, not volatile behavior “particularly because the impact of the likely decline in Fed rates is not known, given the high level of crude and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions.”
Javier Barrio, BPI’s sales manager in Spain, agrees that it’s not a good time to venture into saying there will be a rally.
"It's not the thing for many joys," the expert assures.
The Ibex has lost nearly 4% from its highs on November 8 when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts have this negative view.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year closer to 16,000 points thanks to the restructuring of portfolios and traditional contributions to pension plans that occur every year on these dates.
However, the expert says things will be slightly different this year as he believes the rally will advance to the second week of December, after the Constitution bridge.
The analyst does not think that volatility will affect the market trend.
Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, says we are close to technical levels and “then we could see a rebound in the index that could be boosted depending on the news coming from the U.S. regarding the consequences of the credit market crisis.”
The analyst believes that these are positive.
Analysts agree when choosing the values that will be in charge of bringing the Ibex to new maximum quotas.
Solana, of Intermoney, says that “this year is about the big values.”
The expert would include in the portfolio the two big banks and some builders “because when the date comes, the electricity sector will be very expensive.”
Federico Olucha, of Inversis Banco, said the increases will come from the bank and the industrial sector.
The builders will also be able to benefit from this rally, in case they give themselves.
“ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we expect other builders like Ferrovial and FCC to follow their own path,” the expert explains.
Cyclical consumption will be the protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technology will also do very well although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has been a low month on only two occasions.
The real end-of-year rally was held in 2003, an exercise in which stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the tech bubble.
This year, in which the Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December recorded a 6.68% rebound.
It will be necessary to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of earnings (at the moment the Ibex is up 8.36% since January) and if it manages to count on its end-of-year rally.
Popular will open 200 offices 12 hours Monday to Saturday
Popular has decided to renew much of its offices.
A total of 200, located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a major change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish entities, as it is the first group that decides to take the leap to bet on the uninterrupted opening of their agencies until 20.30 in the afternoon, and open on Saturdays from 10 am to 20.30 in the afternoon.
Another group that has also reiterated on several occasions that wanted to expand the schedules of its branches, BBVA, has not yet decided to take the step.
Meanwhile, he is about to close a deal with unions to close 75% of his offices on Saturdays in exchange for opening an afternoon, though not to the public.
The results of Popular’s experience will be decisive for other entities to target or not this initiative that seconds trading schedules.
This is precisely the goal that Popular pursues with the project.
Capture private customers who move through these areas to make their purchases, to SMEs, autonomous and shops of the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to have these 200 offices open all over Spain in about 18 months, as they are not new openings but remodeling existing ones.
To this end, the entity will modernize the branches it already has in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile presented by customers from the different streets.
In this way, the expansion of the schedules is accompanied by a different conception of the branch space and a new design, more current, with brighter colors.
Commercial bank manager <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera says this restructuring is not a big investment, though it is a higher hiring of staff, since it goes from about six employees per place to eight or nine.
The offices, which will even have space for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
Positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its initiative in three offices in Madrid.
And the experience has been positive, according to <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivero.
The branches of the streets Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía de Madrid have been chosen, and it seems right, according to Rivero.
Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And another 60 operating under the immigrant brand Mundocredit, also with very wide schedules, which even open on Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax premises will not repeat the BBVA model, where several of its offices have a large range of non-financial products for sale.
“We don’t want to compete with our customers,” Rivero said.
At the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with staff outside the bank.
Telecinco doubles the value of its rival Antena 3 for the first time
We've got it."
With that phrase yesterday, Paolo Vasile, CEO of Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction at the closing of the market, when he noted that the chain he manages doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
Only one aspect spoiled his joy: “It’s what hurts me, not because we’ve grown more, but because we’ve dropped less.”
Still, he stressed that in a weak market, ‘we have fallen less’.
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with a 2.54% advance.
That gain puts its loss in what we have year-on-year at 15.66%.
The stock market value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of capital) and held by Vocento (another 13%) thus reaches <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4,488.88 million, according to Bloomberg data.
Its rival Antena 3, which yesterday dropped 1.52% and accumulated a drop of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other listed communications companies amounts to 3.571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2.518.53 million Prisa (Five Day Publisher) and 1.779 million Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is due to the fact that 'we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do, in the same market, at what cost and how we make it more profitable in terms of audience.”
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become the first television channel this year to exceed 1 billion gross advertising revenues, according to Giuseppe Tringali, CEO of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the company that manages the group’s advertising.
If this announced data were to be realised, the television channel would record this year an increase of 3.6% in its advertising revenue from the 965.4 million in fiscal 2006.
For its part, Antena 3’s net revenue increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (up to 734.4 million) while TV’s net revenue grew by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to for the best relative evolution on the Telecinco Stock Exchange is the high payout it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile says that, although it is soon to make the decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% Endemol in partnership with its Mediaset matrix.
“We have the official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always stated a lot more.
This year, I hope we will be able to make our shareholders happy, to whom we have already valued with 33% of Endemol’.
According to analysts, the market gives samples at these moments of certain fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit estimates for Telecinco by 4% in 2008 and by 7% in 2009.
It is explained that revenue growth has been reduced from 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent in 2008 and from 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent in 2009.
This same firm has lowered Antenna 3’s earnings forecast by 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.

Congress approves the transposition of Mifid, which entered into force on 1 November
Parallel to its parliamentary process, which ended today with a vote by Congress on the amendments incorporated in the Senate, the Government has submitted to the public hearing the regulation to develop the new law, with the aim of both coming into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the different groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by MEPs and senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulations in order to ensure investor protection and to regulate in detail the activities of entities for the efficient functioning of markets.
The Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, involves the modernisation of financial markets, while strengthening investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and fostering cooperation between the various supervisors of the European Union.
The new regulation will allow financial advisory services to both specialized firms and natural or legal persons and create a new type of financial services firms (ESIS), financial advisory firms (AFIs), which join securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management firms.
In addition, it expands the number of systems for the execution of transactions on financial instruments, so that regulated secondary markets are added to multilateral trading systems and order internalization systems, which will compete with current exchange managers.
The Act also requires investment service companies to disclose information on key aspects of their business profile, exposure to risk and forms of risk management in the market and requires them to keep a record of all transactions they perform, in order to facilitate supervision by the CNMV.
In its passage by the Congressional Economic Commission, several amendments were incorporated, including highlighting that securitized debts are considered as a "complex" financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, which has been demonstrated by what happened with the U.S. high-risk mortgage debt.
In addition, the transposition of the directive was used to legally delimit the functions that graduates in Economics and Business can develop 30 years after the actual decree delimiting the professional functions reserved for economists was passed in 1977.
For its part, the Senate incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the mediator, who will work on behalf of others, will not require the authorization of the CNMV and will be able to provide its product marketing and customer picking services to different investment firms at the same time.
Harmonized IPC increases five-tenths in November, up to 4.1%
This indicator, which later serves Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation index in the European Union, provides an advance on how prices in Spain evolved during November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) to provide timely and quality data comparable to those produced in the United States.
The forward indicator is calculated using the same procedure as the employee for the Harmonized Consumer Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate the information that is not yet available at the time of its publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is purely indicative, so it does not necessarily have to coincide with the final data, which will be announced next December 14.
"The IPC will continue at relatively high levels"
Vice-President Pedro Solbes said the increase in 4.1 percent of the IPC in November was a “temporary figure” but at the same time promised that the price index would continue at “relatively high” levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes has pointed out in the hallways of Congress that "although the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential from the monetary union remains "more or less" the same in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the government did not count on such a high rise.
“We were expecting a figure of around 4%,” the Minister of Economy acknowledged with respect to the forward-looking figure today.
Virgin plans to raise <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>42 billion with Northern Rock in three years
Northern Rock’s deposits have fallen by more than 50% to <0xC2><0xA3>12 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16.8 billion) since it entered a crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England.
At that time it amassed record deposits above <0xC2><0xA3>25 billion, a figure that has fallen progressively in two and a half months by the mistrust of its customers and despite the guarantee of one hundred percent of that money that the government offered and that will maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would rename the entity with its financial brand Virgin Money, needs to capture around a quarter of the revenues in British banks deposited over the next three years to achieve those <0xC2><0xA3>18 billion remaining until it reaches the target of <0xC2><0xA3>30 billion.
The group of magnate Richard Branson, known for its striking advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70 million) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve its purpose.
Northern Rock this week named the Virgin consortium’s offer, in which three other companies participated, as its preferred to rescue him from bankruptcy.
Mayor of Totana arrested for alleged urban corruption plot
The Civil Guard has arrested the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (the People's Party) for his alleged relationship with the urban corruption plot outlined this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the consistory and the chief of police of the municipality have also been arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales, current MP, and until then governor of the municipality, and that according to sources of the research consulted by the SER chain, could be the 'headline' of this plot.
Officers continue to record municipal offices and the Urbanism Advisory Board and no further arrests are to be ruled out in the coming hours.
In addition, Juan Morales, the main suspect in the plot of urban corruption outlined earlier this week, has been charged.
As the SER Chain reported yesterday, the lawyer of the 'popular' deputy Juan Morales, therefore harassed, was stopped leaving Morales’s home with important documentation related to the plot.
Moreover, the object of the research, according to sources of the research, is the alleged collection of commissions by Morales in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galician construction company to re-qualify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, eight people have been arrested.
Bono agrees to lead the PSOE’s candidacy for Toledo and preside over Congress if they win
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to head the PSOE list for Toledo for the upcoming general elections and be the president of Congress in case the Socialists win the general elections.
This was announced in a press conference by the secretary of the PSOE’s Organization, José Blanco, and Bono himself, after the meeting that he held this afternoon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The chief of the executive has justified the offer to the former minister because "it is important to have the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
In addition, he pointed out that “it seems” that the political maneuver will be the candidate of the socialist group to preside over Congress if the socialists win in the upcoming elections.
Bono would replace as Congress president Manuel Marín, who made public on November 15 his decision not to run for the upcoming general election and to abandon his career in active politics to devote himself to fighting climate change in the university field.
The former minister has acknowledged that the president has not stopped insisting that he return to the political forefront since he left her two years ago.
In addition, he noted that, just as citizens know who the economic vice president will be if the PSOE wins the election, his party has wanted to announce who will preside over Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he reaches the post, Bono hopes to turn the House into “the house of respect and not of insult or screaming” and to make it “more and more like the citizens.”
“Sometimes unfortunately it seems that the only place in Madrid where you can’t speak in peace and quiet is Congress, the president of the government on one occasion was interrupted in the Senate 26 times.”
Also, he has had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and “his good work” and has not wanted to be seen occupying his place anymore so as not to fall into what, he noted, his opponents could see as “prepotence”.
Climate propaganda
Since the movement against climate change is subject to merciless persecution of both skeptics of its predictions and those prioritizing other political and social battles, it is obliged to show iron consistency.
And another leader of the movement who is president of the government as Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and even proposes to sign a “new contract with the planet.”
That approach forces him to explain why his government’s action, or inaction, has made a decisive contribution to Spain leading the EU in Kyoto’s failure to comply.
Who are the perpetrators of the breach, in what sectors it has occurred, and why his Government, that of the contract with the planet, has not prevented it.
In addition, it requires you to explain with the utmost clarity to the Spaniards what measures you are going to take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what habits citizens will need to change, what individual and collective energy savings we will be obliged to do, what economic consequences it will have.
That is, who will sacrifice himself and who will pay to save the planet.
But there has never been or will be such explanations.
It is precisely because it is about sacrificing and paying.
The measures against climate change, the real measures, are unpopular.
Expensive, inconvenient and threatening for the accounts of companies and individuals.
Even the cent of the gasoline suggested by the PSOE has seemed so dangerous electorally to Zapatero that it has hurried to deny it.
That is, that it is about saving the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda, with empty slogans of all real consequence.
With shocking sentences, commissions, committees, protocols, new posts.
With contracts with the planet, this gentleman is so useful for election campaigns that he neither speaks nor denounces nor demands, but he adorns the myths and inspires tenderness.
As long as it’s just a purely virtual contractor and don’t pretend we’re riding a bike or refreshing ourselves with the range.
Mayor and head of local Totana Police arrested for alleged urban corruption plot
The Civil Guard has arrested the mayor of the municipality of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the City Council and a hotel businessman for possible urban crimes, sources of the investigation have reported today.
The building was arrested at his home and has been transferred to the Consistory, in whose offices he is currently with numerous agents, who have also attended the City Hall of Urbanism and the municipal company for the management of the Industrial and Housing Soil.
These three arrests add to the six carried out last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the re-evaluation of more than 2 million hectares of rustic land in urbanizable for the Galician company Nuaria to build 4,000 homes, after paying illegal fees during the last legislature.
In addition, two other people were not arrested but are charged in the summary, which is instructed by the No. 1 Court of Totana.
The first six detainees have now become available to the courts.
According to sources, the former Totana governor and today PP autonomous parliamentarian, Juan Morales, is being investigated.
In addition, the former woman, owner of a real estate agency registered today in Totana, has been charged, as has the current girlfriend of the former governor, who resides in Murcia capital.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the Viguês lawyer and businessman Manuel N.A., was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as was Pablo José M.G., director of Inmonuar Soil, an integrated agency in the aforementioned Group, and through which the bribes would have been carried out.
The investigation is carried out by the Central Operating Unit of the Civil Guard’s Urban Crimes Group (UCO), whose agents, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven records, the majority in companies related to the detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
A single person was then arrested in Totana, in particular, the owner of a well-known poultry company in the region, which could have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for developing what would be the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 homes, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired in Totana 2.2 million square meters of land that were re-qualified and its project would double the population of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group integrates companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, dedicated to real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the existing car parks in the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and the square of Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, dedicated to the direct marketing sector; Recommends, focused on the promotion, sale and installation of elements.
Things that happen
Articles 1 and 2
If you like, let’s take a look at the Book of the Month, to see if we have yet another ‘primiology’ and other competencies.
I'm already walking something.
Life is change, people.
Of course, you are invited to propose inventions.
Article 2
Our Finnish correspondent provides us with this comment from yesterday in Finland’s most important newspaper (at the head of the PISA report on education in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day that there appeared, curiously, the critique of the Black book.
"The content of the signing of Philosophy has jumped into public opinion as a result of the tragedy of Jokela's school.
The culprit of the deaths, a graduate student, cited in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
Education Adviser in charge of the subject of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded from the pages of the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato and stated that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy at the institutes.
Article 3
A colleague passes information on the introduction of the Criminal Code on Internet Downloads:
A. The download of a song would be a crime with a penalty of six months to a year.
Instead, if you steal at the store discs worth less than 400 euros, it is simply considered missing (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,000 in the store, theft is already a crime, but the penalty remains lower than the penalty imposed on discharge (Article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty remains lower than that of the discharge (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the exchange of compacts.
Participating in a tumultuous line is a three-month to one-year penalty (Article 154 of the Criminal Code) and the exchange would be a six-month to two-year penalty.
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a DVD movie, according to article 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. Distribution of copyrighted and unauthorized films is more punishable than distribution of pornographic material to minors (Article 186).
After all, if my colleague is right, someone is going hand, a very long hand.
Article 4
My head doctor gives me one of his rare research articles titled: ‘Money produces brain activation, especially if others get less.’
That is, that the feelings generated by the monthly pay of the workers depend on what the peers earn.
The study has been carried out by tomographic magnetic resonance imaging at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Neurocognition Imaging group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: “The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his partner failed.”
The researchers noted that if when both were right they received the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one received the double, the activation was greater.
I don't know if I needed that much science.
The Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been implacably chasing war criminals in the Balkans for eight years since the prosecution of the former Yugoslavian Criminal Court in The Hague.
Her term ends at the end of the year and Carla will taste bitter, because the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre - in which 8,000 Muslim Bosnians were killed -, former General Ratko Mladic and former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic, remain free.
Her names are on that list that takes the title of the documentary by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach, 'La lista de Carla' (2006, not premiered in Spain), which, at the rhythm of a police thriller, follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York to chase the fugitive criminals and pressure the government to imply that they are imprisoned.
What insurance suits me?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in case of possible accidents, is an important expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, age of the passport, civil status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use of it, among others.
Having a car is just the beginning.
And it is that, choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
First of all, we need to be clear about what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insured.
This commitment is realized in an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the amount of the agreed premium in exchange for being responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in case of accident.
The premium is the insurance price, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, age of the card, civil status, the type of vehicle to be insured or its use, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices based on statistics, so the more likely they are to suffer an accident, the higher the fee to be paid.
That’s why both older than 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics reflect that they have a lower rate of accidentality due to their prudence.
Also, by taking the counts, companies have come to the conclusion that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use that is given to the vehicle will influence the frequency, and thereby the likelihood of having some kind of percance.
As the frequency increases, the odds increase.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the price of the premium.
That is why the driver must carefully study the situation to choose the car insurance that best fits his profile.
Here we will expose the most significant variables when choosing one or another type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insured, offers you a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 face various drawbacks when contracting insurance at an affordable price, such as reduced driving experience and old age.
Although the ideal for being well-insured is all-risk insurance, there are other more economical options.
The most cautious drivers can opt for a whole-risk franchise, so they get insurance coverage at all-risk but at a more feasible price.
This type of agreement would require the customer to pay a part of the amount of the sin.
“The portion of the amount of the sin of the customer will be pre-established based on the value of the premium, which will be the higher the lower the amount,” says Luis Noguera, Spain’s top-ranked First Europe insurance broker.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the customer ensures protection against damage caused to third parties, although not against those caused in his own car.
In addition, it would be covered by theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
A tip.
If you are under the age of 25 try to be careful and avoid accidents as much as possible, as this will affect the bonus, which can reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction on the base rate owned by the company.
On the contrary, a penalty is a surcharge on such a base rate.
“The bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and its benefit.
If the company has had a good year it will be able to afford to increase the bonuses,” explains Noguera.
After the 25-year-old streak, drivers make it easier to hire insurance, as the accident rate is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
For this reason, it is most advisable to engage a whole risk with a franchise.
“Normally, young people can’t take advantage of the experience previously gained in an accident, and even in driving,” says the director in Spain of the European company, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, once the ‘fear of the novice’ has passed.
However, if the client is married but still has no children, it is preferable to negotiate insurance at all risk, as long as their economic situation allows it, of course it is.
Marriages with children are considered by insurers to be the public with the lowest sinisterity rate, so the charges will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be one at all risk with a franchise (may be 300 euros), or, when a high level of bonus is available, one to third parties extended from the third year of the vehicle life.
“They carry out a more relaxed driving and have greater purchasing power to afford the luxury of taking on a larger amount of franchise,” said Luis Noguera.
For retirees it is advisable to have insurance at all risk with a franchise (being this one of 150 euros), or one to third parties expanded when you have a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is important, not only because it covers the driver in the event of possible accidents, but also because it represents an important expense, which is why it is essential to properly study the insurance that best suits us according to our personal situation.
The Celtic is looking for a point worth eight in Milan
Milan and Celtic are on Tuesday in San Siro looking for the point they lack to achieve their respective goals in the closing of the Champions League, as it serves to be the first Italians and the Scots to judge their qualification.
The Italians add ten points and already certified their pass on the fifth day with a draw in Portugal, while the Celtic has nine points, but still needs another one to make sure that the Shakhtar, with six, and that he receives the Benfica, who has four, do not advance him.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the entire sixth day ends, as Milan has to compete in the Club World Cup in Japan, where it debuts on day 13 in semifinals looking for a place for the final of 16.
Thus, this group will be closed before the rest and the emptiness in Giuseppe Meazza seems the most expected result, although the two teams will try to go out for a win, as the Italians will not want to speculate at home and the Celtic knows that winning would stay first and ensure a better crossing in octaves.
The Gordon Strachan team could even serve a defeat to qualify if the Shakhtar does not win, but will not be able to be trusted because the pass is for the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanists will try to bitter the night for the Scots, who trust to get into the eighth for the second time in the restructured Champions League and consecutively, after they were precisely defeated in that round last campaign with a Kaka goal in the extension (1-0) after the 0-goal.
Awaiting the victory of the 'rossoneri' will be the Shakhtar who only deserves the victory, in case he loses the Celtic, both to get into the eighth place and to continue in UEFA.
And it is that Benfica, despite being the last and without options to continue in the top European competition, could reach third place with a win, with which UEFA would play.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls have begun in Vancouver, Canada, with some 20,000 spectators, their first tour since they disbanded in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) stated shortly before starting their concert at GM Place in Vancouver.
Approximately 20,000 people exhausted the tickets to attend the concert which included a video recounting the story of the band that raged in the late 1990s.
The reunion and the world tour coincide with the release of a new album that collects its major hits as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which EMI publishes in Spain.
The five members of Spice Girls went on stage wearing bracelets that had been given to them by 'Posh Spice''s husband, British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the crowd that engulfed GM Place, even though Victoria’s nerves had banned him days earlier.
In the preview of the show, Victoria Beckham noted that the British star "hasn't seen our dressing room, for nothing, so I'm nervous about what he's going to think about the show."
'Sporty Spice' whose departure from the group in 1998 "for the differences between us" provoked the quintet's dissolution two years later, also expressed its nervousness during a press meeting, two hours before the show's start.
"I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that the feeling of the world has changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, so I'm happy to have made the decision," Chisholm said of the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, "things have been arranged and we all love each other very much."
But many things have changed since the Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
To begin with, according to CTV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
Upon their arrival at the airport, an army of babysitters awaited them.
Among the five are seven children.
Following the Vancouver concert, the group will perform in California (USA), San Jose (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
They will perform in Madrid on December 23.
New fears about gas between Russia and Ukraine
The growing dispute over the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk that it will affect Russia’s export of fuel to Western Europe.
Most of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is directed through Ukraine, so every stream between the two nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow raises the price of gas, Russia will have to pay higher traffic charges.
A previous dispute last year reduced supplies to EU states.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, the gas monopoly owner, Gazprom, trying to agree on the amount of money Ukraine had to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom said it would charge more to Ukraine, as it has pledged to pay an extra 50% in 2008 for the gas coming from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say it could be that Ukraine pays 40% more for imports of Gazprom.
"It's important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important transits for gas during the talks," Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinakh told Reuters.
“The changes in gas prices should not be related to our arguments on the levels of transit rates [to Western Europe] via Ukraine.”
The last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut supply to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a drop in exports to western Europe, which quickly raised prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the EU’s supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it is still not fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supply from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet nations in Central Asia.
NHS "should test foreign workers"
The Scottish NHS needs to check the criminal records of employees outside Europe, a watchdog said.
Auditor General Robert Black’s recommendation came after it was found that a foreign doctor was related to the attack on Glasgow airport in June.
Black also showed his concern that the Scottish NHS has no exact idea of the number of foreign personnel it has.
However, his report noted other checks that are carried out correctly through a sample of five health authorities.
The auditor-general checked the number of foreign personnel hired outside the European Economic Area following the attacks on Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after crashing a jeep at the airport's terminal building doors.
He was one of three doctors who acted at the Old Bailey by video conference in October, accused of alleged car bombings in the UK.
NHS expects to carry out pre-employment checks to candidates, to ensure they meet the qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the UK.
Although the Scottish Health Board uses "Disclosure Scotland" to carry out criminal record checks, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside the UK.
The Auditor-General’s report recommends, among other measures, that the boards should have the Criminal Records Bureau guide, which helps employers with criminal controls in many countries outside the UK.
"Although we find some of the personal records with evidence of these controls, this is not a routine review," the report says.
Black states that the Scottish NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but notes that: "our report highlights areas that can be improved to ensure that the necessary information is available in the number of foreign NHS staff."
Scotland’s BMA president, Dr. Peter Terry, said it was “very unlikely” that pre-employment checks could identify potential NHS employees who might commit terrorist acts in the future.
“The report suggests pre-employment checks work in NHS Scotland but it’s not clear what the added value of the recommendations made,” he explained.
Scottish health authorities say they currently have 1,161 foreign people, most of them doctors and nurses.
But the auditor general warned that the number may be higher, in part because boards have trouble identifying which employees have indefinite residence permits.
The investigation also found that the verification procedures established by the NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were being widely complied with.
This includes passport controls, work permits and qualification checks.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing the policy and pre-employment guide of foreigners at the NHS.
The health secretary, Nicola Sturgeon, said: “I was very interested in doing this work following the terrorist attack at Glasgow airport.
He added that the Scottish government, together with the health boards, could consider the recommendations of the reports and that this will be reflected in the update of the pre-employment control guidelines for all working groups – including foreigners – what they planned to publish next month.
Joy Division dominates film awards
Control, the biographical film about late Joy Division vocalist Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including the award for best film.
The trophies were also given to the protagonist Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse until he was chosen for the role of Curtis, for director Anton Corbijn and co-protagonist Toby Kebbell.
Actress Judi Dench was nominated for Best Actress for the thriller "Notes of a Scandal".
And Bond protagonist Daniel Craig won the variety award for putting a British film on the international stage.
The awards were presented at a ceremony at the London Roundhouse.
Control follows Curtis' rise to fame with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, at the age of 23.
The black-and-white film featuring soundtrack from The Killers, David Bowie and New Order was produced with just <0xC2><0xA3>3,000.
But also the winner was Dutch photographer Corbijn, already known for the iconic character of U2's Joshua Tree album, awarded with two awards - best director and best debuting director.
Rock music was the centerpiece of another award-winning ceremony—like Julien Temple’s film about The Clash vocalist Joe Strummer, won the award for best documentary.
The award for best actor was won by Viggo Mortensen for his role as the driver of a head of the Russian mafia in the film David Cronenberg's East Promises.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing hard, received the Richard Jarris Award for his contribution to British cinema.
The fiftieth, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth, and Sexy Beast, is currently filming Indiana Jones' sequel "The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull".
Winstone said he was proud to receive that award, named after Harris, the star of Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
“It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me,” he said.
“I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a couple of times.
He was a great guy, a great actor of our time, it's really an honor."
The independent film awards, known as BIFAS, are selected by a team that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa festival supporters and patrons include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrests 208 terrorists
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it arrested 208 militants from terrorist cells planning an imminent attack on oil facilities, as well as attacks on religious and security forces.
The state television of the world’s largest oil supplier said one of the cells was planning missile smuggling.
Al-Qaeda sympathizers have mounted a campaign against the local monarchy, in alliance with the United States, since 2003 following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants made up of foreign residents was planning an attack on an oil facility in the Eastern province, the television report said.
Saudi Arabia has created a 35,000-strong force to protect Abqaiq, the world’s largest oil plant, after a failed Al-Qaeda attack in 2006.
The report, citing a statement by the Saudi Interior Minister, said 18 of the detainees belong to a cell led by a "missile launch expert" who has entered the country.
The minister said the militants had planned the entry by smuggling eight missiles into the country.
Another 22 of the detainees were planning the killings of religious leaders and security forces.
The government warned religious leaders to be more active in stopping Saudis traveling to Iraq from joining al-Qaeda as militants to fight the Allied forces and backing the Shiite Muslim government, which is considered heretic by the most extreme Saudi Sunni.
Al-Qaeda militants target many religious in Saudi Arabia who have been appointed by the authorities to support the policies of the royal family, which is dominated by the government.
The militants – recruited by the calls of Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born al-Qaeda leader, to harass the country’s pro-Western government – targeted government-associated foreign residences, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This was a great effort by the security forces, for five months of work," the interior minister's spokesman told state television.
The arrests also include a “media cell” of 16 people in Medina, whose objective was to promote “the takfiri thought” – the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims supporting violence against Muslims considered infidels and apostates.
The arrest includes 32 other people accused of providing financial support and support to the militants.
Venus' climate can give you an idea of Earth's future
Venus may have once been an appropriate place for life, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft in orbit showed the planet more like an Earth twin than had previously been observed.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
The two planets are similar in size and occupy similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus may have had conditions similar to those that made Earth a habitable planet, scientists now believe.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and greenhouse effect, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation and slower solar rotation sent Venus to a very different type of development.
Today the planet has no water, the surface temperature is enough to melt lead and is eroded by hurricane winds and lightning storms.
The results of the European Space Agency for the Venus Express, which has been studying the planet for a year, provide an overview of how Earth could develop catastrophic changes due to climate.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: “It is clarifying why the climate on Venus is so different from Earth, when two planets are so similar.
“Our new data makes it possible to build a scenario where Venus began as Earth, possibly with a habitable environment millions of years ago.”
Police deprive ‘enriched uranium’
A kilogram of radioactive material, which they say is enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The cash could not confirm whether it was enriched uranium but said it could have been sold for <0x24>1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>480,000).
It's still open
Mitt Romney says it’s unworthy for presidential candidates to answer questions from a snow monkey.
However, Republican presidential candidates eventually agree to hold a debate on YouTube, in which common and current voters record questions in video and send them for dissemination among candidates.
None of the questions posed on Wednesday afternoon were more ridiculous than that of the snow monkey who asked Democrats about climate warming in the YouTube Republican party’s debate.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected much of the Republican party’s state of affairs ahead of next year’s elections.
It is not known exactly how the CNN producers, who co-sponsored the debate, chose YouTube videos to show candidates to aspirants.
But the first half-hour of debate, the longest devoted to a single topic, focused on immigration.
The topic is one of the most powerful topics for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of indecisive voters to climb the dial when they heard ideas they liked: broadcasters noticed approval peaks when candidates spoke with extremist arguments.
The hardest words of the night were exchanged between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. Romney, who has been a pivotal figure in the crucial Iowa and New Hampshire surveys.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin Romney's reputation as he was soft with illegal immigration when he was New York's mayor.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work in his home.
They both responded aggressively when asked if any candidate could support an “amnesty” (allowing illegals to regularize their situation and giving them the opportunity to obtain citizenship).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, reached agreement on the issue.
No one has the word to be nominated as a candidate, but both remain in the race perhaps because both warned about the issue of immigration before the others.
At least in immigration, and in general, candidates share views: increased border surveillance, intolerance to illegal immigrants.
This topic, along with the fear of China’s toxic toys and other external concerns, helps Republicans forget, or minimize, the divisions between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate became uncomfortable when other topics emerged.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported gun control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether water immersion should be considered torture.
One person asked if the candidates believed in each word of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to stumble into the position that while the Bible was his favorite book, he did not literally believe in the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another person asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee – now, against all expectations, first in the most recent Iowa survey, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism – said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressured to answer whether Jesus would be in favour, he laughed saying that Jesus was too smart to be a candidate in the election.
The race is unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee is growing in Iowa, coincidentally with the campaigns of liberal Ron Paul, and his warm statements from Wednesday’s debate.
The two have come out of the background, because the two wings of the party did not agree on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the party early and convincingly with a winning message about America's greatness, satisfying both sides of the party.
This time the game is divided and the result is far from clear.
Dolores Labour
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole in which to sink; but also emerges
As political scandals continue in England, this is not particularly interesting.
No influences seem to have been sold, no exorbitant hotel accounts in Paris, no extramarital fingertips.
But it has been revealed that a wealthy businessman has disguised contributions to the British Labour government party, more than <0xC2><0xA3>650,000 (<0x24>1.3 million), for nearly four years using fake names, and that the party has not denounced it.
Two months ago, when the prime minister failed to call an election, stupidly insulting British intelligence by stating that polls did not influence his decision, the hope was that it would provide a strong and efficient government.
But instead, like Vince Calbe, the Liberal Democrat leads with increasing ingenuity, because the feared Mr. Brown has gone from being Stalin to being Mr. Bean.
The rescue of Northern Rock, a bank in trouble, demonstrated regulatory weakness and judgement poverty in times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the tax code have put business groups, together, against the government.
The tax authority lost 25 million personal data that revealed an unimaginable administrative bump.
A trio of retired generals started a riot in the House of Lords, protesting the cuts in military spending: to be ministers of the armed forces is, they claimed, a half-time job.
Now they are the multiple donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Labour general secretary (and former accomplice) has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown walks irrevocably towards the exit.
Governments can reach a turning point after they find themselves unable to govern.
People don’t believe them as politicians, but they usually suspend their disbelief when a new batch takes control.
Once it’s clear that the prime minister can’t improve things, that he doesn’t have much time left, that suspension is too much: public officials start failing; cabinet ministers are exposed; the press is looking for bad news; and the government puts itself on the defensive and doesn’t focus.
In part, Brown’s position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he can’t defend himself by arguing that he’s new.
Although he wanted to renounce Tony Blair, he was his senior lieutenant.
The problems of Northern Rock and the authority registration tax, are related to the decisions that Brown made as Chancellor of the Error.
And even if he’s not directly involved in Blairish’s counter-terrorism — or “offering for partners,” the investigation into political parties’ funding — voters can assume that if he is.
However, Mr. Brown’s situation is not as bad as it seems.
The plates are not as bad as the Tories want to show.
Like Mr. Bean, no one has died, nor has he been directly scammed.
And the remedy, though painful, is to give what Mr. Brown’s naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political scandal of donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compares his donations with charitable gifts, says he does not want public recognition for his benevolence.
This may be the case, but the decision is not made by him.
The laws against anonymity for large political taxpayers are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has the right to know who is buying access to those who have power.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew of Mr. Abraham's agreement, and that he was not illegal, will obviously face Jon Mendlesohn, the head of fundraising who was asked about donations in October.
But Mr. Brown is not involved so far: there is nothing that suggests he knew of these performances, although the bulk of the payments were made after he took control of the office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He has been quick to condemn his party for violating the law, but is diluted in decision-making by a family matter, a commission of investigation on the matter - conducted, to a large extent, by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, morals are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it's a matter of the police.
In addition, there are other things Mr Brown must do, such as finding a permanent and independent head for the Public Life Standards Commission, as he has not had one for six months, and he must also press for a genuine reform of party funding.
This will require a hard cooperative work of the Labour with the Tories, and perhaps a renouncement of the special financial situation with the trade unions - bitter measures for a partisan like Mr Brown.
But he has to deal with some partisan facts.
Conservatives now have a good level of support in polls; he has two years to win voters; and the only way he can move to victory is to act with impeccable probity and solid competition.
Card sharks
Is the subprime mortgage crisis infecting the American credit card market?
When there’s blood in the water, it’s natural that a back wing swims excited around.
Now that the U.S. housing market is in crisis, predators have their eyes set on the country’s credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate that credit card losses can reach <0x24>99 million if the mortgage crisis subprimes other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of contagion are already seen.
There is an increase in both card charges and crime rates, which measures the proportion of balances that have not been amortized or that have more than 30 days of delay respectively.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken over 1.4 million positions in its U.S. consumer financing business, in part due to the weakness of card lenders.
However, it is too early for panic.
Morality and crime are at low levels.
According to Moody’s, a rating agency, in the third quarter the crime rate of 3.89% was almost a percentage point below the historic average.
The deterioration in rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in the U.S. bankruptcy law (2005) resulted in a sudden drop in bankruptcy claims, which in turn represent a large loss on credit cards; the number of claims (and therefore, delays) would be growing again, or it may happen that conditions for lenders were worsening.
The industry also reports solid payment rates, which show how much of its debts consumers pay each month.
And trust in credit cards and asset-backed securities is quite firm, despite the paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts emission volumes for 2007 will be around 25% higher than last year.
The direct channels of infection from the crisis between subprime mortgages and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers like to charge debts to credit cards now that credit institutions are expiring.
But credit card issuers look more at the flow of liquidity than assets, so that falling prices do not necessarily trigger a change in creditors’ creditor capacity.
They can even work to advance the emitters.
Incentives for consumers to continue to amortize the mortgage decreases if properties are worth less than the value of the loan; and as a result, card debt payment rises on the list of priorities.
Card issuers can also respond quickly and flexibly to the difficult conditions that mortgage lenders, changing interest rates or altering creditor balances.
That in theory should reduce the risk of a rapid asset rebound.
“We’re not going to wake up one day and re-evaluate all loans,” said Gary Perlin, Chief Finance Officer at Capital One.
If a sudden subprime infection in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained decline are much more real.
If home prices are lower and a credit contraction pushes America into recession, the industry is undoubtedly facing a more severe future.
We need to keep an eye on those spinal fins.
British bankers found guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who were prosecuted for their responsibility in the frauds with Enron’s former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, were found guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found innocent of seven fraud charges for colluding with Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of employees.
They were sent to trial in January.
But during the hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each was convicted of collusion in fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich Natwest, a unit of the Scottish PLC group at the Royal Bank, became a famous cause in Britain for two-year extradition proceedings.
In the United States, his case marks the end of an investigation launched after Enron’s collapse in 2001.
Initially, the charges against the bankers were to have warned in 2002 Fastow that it was the target of a government investigation into Enron’s fall.
The accusation against the bankers — doubled the “NatWest Three” — claims they came to Houston in 2000 to invent a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his former senior assistant, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of a Fastow-controlled Enron society, which was the creator of a myriad of frauds at Enron, which helped its bankruptcy spiral.
In 2002, the bank valued the subsidiary's interest at zero, but the three British knew it would value upwards.
A company under Kopper's control bought the subsidiary's bank interest in <0x24>1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper <0x24>250,000 for interest in the company.
According to the accusation, Fastow falsely represented Enron, as the energy company would pay <0x24>20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares of the subsidiary.
But the 20 million were left in the hands of British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received 7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received about 12.3 million, according to the accusation.
In January 2004, Fastow was convicted of two conspiracy charges in the collapse of Enron.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a sentence of 3 years and a month in Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers must pay the <0x24>1 million they required to live in the United States while the trial was taking place.
Enron, one of the nation’s seven largest companies, declared bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, could not hide the debt of millions or make their failed businesses look successful.
The collapse caused the loss of thousands of jobs, more than 60 million in market value and more than two million in pension plans.
Enron’s founder Kenneth Lay and former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling were commissioned for their roles in the company’s collapse last year.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay’s conviction for conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when he died of a heart attack last year.
Not down or out in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough fuel capacity to fly directly from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at <0x24>54 million.
But this is a small expense for some of the wealthy Russians.
"It has a capacity of up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, representative for Gulfstream.
“But no one asks for that model of so many seats because it’s for family private flights or for presidents of a company.”
Mr. Fairer was in charge of the Gulfstream cabin last Friday at the Millionaire Fair, a four-day consumer orgy held at an event center in the vicinity of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, another 200 luxury suppliers had installed their display stands, hoping to attract new Russians suited to all kinds of products, from crafted yachts in mahogany to the diamond-included car grills worth 50 cents.
Mr. Fier carefully looks at a bright orange Porsche in the stand next to his.
"It's a nice car, but it's nickel and boiler compared to us," he said.
“After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private jets.”
Provided with fuel by the rise of oil, the Russian capital resembles Dallas when it was at its peak.
“We lived the same way in 1890, when some acclaimed Americans came to gather in Europe, where they were seen as materialists,” says Marshall Goldman, senior professor at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
“Like the Saudis of the 70s and the Japanese of the 90s, the Russians are emerging as the world’s largest consumers and consumers.”
The world’s most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their part of the cake.
In another part of Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry will be held this week with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell luxury goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times company)
Russia has 53 billionaires making a total of <0x24>282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, the second-degree wealthy include 103 billion Russian billionaires whose money reaches <0x24>670 billion, according to a study of the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economists at the Center for Economic and Financial Research, a local thinkk.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians were below the subsistence level.)
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow – and that’s why we’re all here,” says Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative for David Morris, the London jeweler.
She attends the fair for the first time alongside the Russian distributor of the brand, the Soho Jewelry group.
“Women are impeccablely prepared and men are very decent.”
Visiting the fair on Sunday night, dressed in an afternoon outfit, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described their customers and themselves as millionaires.
“I was looking at the cars and I’m trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche,” said Yumatova, who reeled off the design suit she wore as a red carpet veteran dishing with Joan Rivers.
The fair aims to attract the new rich, the type of buyers who would be willing to stay several hours in a warehouse mixing brands from Cadillac Escalades, platinum pencils, Mövenpick ice cream, custom pool tables, Dubai apartments and Gund teddy bears.
The general public can buy <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 tickets (<0x24>44.57).
"Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically at a stand of the Dutch royal porcelain Delft, in front of a wall-sized reconstruction of a Rembrandt painting, made of hand-painted tiles.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in bling-bling.
In fact, the sellers said that the rich Russians of more track record (10 to 15 years, for Russian standards) have changed their tastes from striking logos to limited edition brands, which would not be exhibited at a trade fair.
However, several thousands of people – cash millionaires, millionaires’ emissaries or tourists – fill the hallways every day.
And some of them buy.
On the first night of the fair last Thursday, Roman Ershov, chief executive of King Koil beds, said he sold two <0x24>70,000 mattress systems each made of silk, cashmere and cotton interwoven with gold yarns.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said the company had sold the bright orange Porsche, for <0x24>170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that modifies luxury cars for special requirements, said he had sold three car grills in the form of a chain bracelet, to Rolls Royce Phantom, for <0x24>55,000 each.
He showed the reporter a car wheel, designed for the owner of a Russian casino, with embedded rays of Swarovski colored crystals, so that it resembled a roulette wheel.
Cost: <0x24>22,000 for four wheels.
“The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a portrait of his wife made of zirconia cubes, is not necessarily going to drive on those wheels,” says Mr. Karapetian.
“He’s going to keep the car in his garage, along with another 30 or 40 cars.”
Even though many of his Russian clients are rich, Mr. Karapetian clarifies that the phrase "Russian billionaire" does not mean exclusivity, given the wave of real estate prices.
“If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, it’s probably already a millionaire, at least on paper if it’s not in cash,” he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich with the support of the Continental Alliance, a Russian asset management firm.
The company made four red (British-style) phone cabins filled with <0x24>1 million stacks of fake banknotes.
Azad Karriev, the company’s marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 fake bills for the Millionaire Fair.
Visitors stopped shaking piles of money, asking their friends to take pictures with their mobile phones while resting on lots of money, or bumping in a couple of millions.
“You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire,” says Karriev.
"Happy" Surgery Could Cause Death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the window of the “A little healthier” restaurant and saw an ambulance climb through White Cape Cod, two doors down West Scott Avenue.
Suddenly, a car from the police patrol appeared.
And then another.
“Then I saw the ambulance go up,” said Mr. Livingston, the restaurant’s supervisor, that Wednesday.
“That’s when I found out that someone had died.”
Authorities said the dead woman was 41-year-old Olga Arroyo, assistant director of the Newark Police Department.
Investigators are now trying to determine if she died due to a procedure performed by an unauthorized plastic surgeon, who is not yet identified by the police, but works at the 212 West Scott Avenue house.
Authorities have not yet determined what caused Mrs. Arroyo's death, but are awaiting the toxicological test even though the results will not be available until a few weeks, which will help solve the mysterious death that has apnea to the top ranks of Newark police.
Mrs. Arroyo had been an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
“She was loyal, hardworking and stubborn,” McCarthy said about Arroyo in a phone interview Wednesday.
"She was my guardian."
She was protecting me.”
Mr. McCarthy said Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcohol Control Commission, and left two children aged 14 and 11, and a nurse.
Eileen Walsh, spokesman for the County Union Attorney, Theodore J. Romankow, said the detectives were trying to determine whether Mrs. Arroyo died from an unauthorized surgical procedure.
"That's one of the possibilities," Walsh said.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
Authorities said they arrived at the house around 3 p.m.
On November 21, they found Mrs. Arroyo on a couch.
She was declared dead on the spot.
More than a week has passed and authorities have said little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, called Flor Margarita Castro.
Mrs. Walsh could not say if Mrs. Castro had been questioned by the authorities.
Researchers are trying to determine which part of the house was used as a medical consultation.
On Wednesday, no one responded to the door at Mrs. Castro’s home, where a marched rose is located on the front of the house, and a dalmatian thief on the back.
A blue drum labeled "vainillin ethyl" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - was at the carriage door, next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hang hooks on one side.
Mr. McCarthy said that when he arrived in Newark after 25 years in the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was an invaluable help to get to know the new island city and its rough political culture.
“She would say, ‘You have to watch with this or that,’” she said.
“She was always here when I was, and also when I wasn’t.
It's embarrassing."
The Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates to raise the Stock Exchange
Shares jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market expected the federal reserve to calm credit conditions with interest rates cuts, which increased with reassuring comments from the vice president of the US central bank.
Stock exchanges slowed in London, New York and across Europe after Ben Bernanke’s No. 2 president, Donald Kohn, declared policy makers should be “flexible and pragmatic” in responding to ongoing financial markets tensions.
In a clear effort to reassure markets amid growing samples of credit exchanges, Kohn said the recent turbulence was "partly reversed by market improvements in late September and during October".
If the upward trend persists, it would increase the possibility of additional adjustments to financial conditions for real estate and business, Kohn said.
The comments were taken by investors as a signal that the reserve is ready to inject fresh capital into U.S. markets and to make subsequent interest rate cuts, to stabilize credit conditions.
The remarks also helped calm Wall Street amid bad news for the U.S. economy, such as home sales that hit the lowest record in October.
The consequences of the financial turbulence were accentuated by a warning from Bear Stearns, an investment bank that will cut 650 jobs, equivalent to 4% of its total workforce, in a global cost reduction to offset the losses of its U.S. subprime mortgage investments.
Only 20 of those posts are expected to enter London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 331 points, or 2.55%, at the close to 13.289.40, while the broad S&P 500 index rose 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7%, when it closed to 6,306.2, adding more than <0xC2><0xA3>39 billion to the value of UK top-ranked companies.
Germany’s Dax index rose by 2.6%, and France’s CAC40 was above 2.3%.
Earlier, the re-emergence of credit tensions in markets was highlighted after a strong demand for funds in a three-month auction by the European Central Bank, which considered those loans to European commercial banks by 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England to follow the action of the Federal Reserve and the ECB and inject extra funds into London's securities markets tensed credit and loan rates to three months "Libor" among British banks, the biggest increase since September, a 6.59%, after a steady 12-month rise.
England condemns Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara’s claims
There are two dilemmas here, each as difficult as the other.
Who should hit No. 6 for England at Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, none is less important in the face of the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the president of the selection that is on loan- with that particular title at least, is here to help Peter Moores, the coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, decide; and also because the desk of Hugh Morris, the director of England, is starting to fill out bids if not national, to become a selector.
Those who don’t get sixth place bat will be unlucky, but life is often unfair and sports too.
It is not easy to throw what a man does at the top of his profession, while another never goes beyond the bottom level, sometimes for lack of luck rather than capacity.
Not only in cricket is the choice difficult, as judgments that always end up being subjective are required.
Is this the right time for Bopara to get up?
Is it fair for Shah if he does?
The same question could be asked in another aspect if, says John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, two brilliant young executives with good grades and who know the business well, would have been promoted to the board: there is only room for one of them.
Who should say what is a good level for a cricket player, unless they give him the opportunity to sink or swim at the next chance?
Figures naturally have a great influence on decisions, but they also have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricket player has to capture the captain's eye at the same time taking a wicket and a batter to get opportunities to change the order if he wants to have an impact as a player someday.
But capturing the eye of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who improved last season, for example, James Anderson, who probably plays in the first test even if Stephen Harmison declares himself for "fit and bowls" like the wind on the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets in 33 races for each to win a spot.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 on the same average, but both have had their highs and can expect more of them.
The games of Shah or Bopara at the Asgiriya stadium can only be a matter of opinion.
The option can break or make a man’s race, or it can mean a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and did well in the first, with 5 wickets and 40 useful races, but it was Paul Collingwood, struggling to establish himself at the same time who came to become an important player, and despite scoring a hundred doubles against Australia, he may still be underestimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after a further discussion at today’s session at Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservation instincts and favor Shah’s greatest experience over the exuberance of young Bopara.
There are arguments for both.
In favor of Shah is his brilliant and valuable 88 debut test in Bombay, 32 hundred first class versus only 6 from Bopara, who, at 22, is seven years younger, and has an excellent history against spin bowling.
But Shah made only ten races in his two rounds in May against the West Indies in the test at Lords, his home as a Middlesex player, and that caused an immediate rejection of the selectors when Vaughan claimed his place for the next match, it seemed to have taken his "batting" a bit of an eloquence that in Bombay.
On the contrary, the Essex team has the joy of living in swords.
He gets stuck for nothing in the cricket field and his attitude was summed up as when he drove his vehicle at an exhibition for England’s car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and, presumably, a shock, but the first thing he did was pull out his Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who looked at the distance, to tell him with excitement, "Did you see that?"
Bopara is the best player, he’s including his sliding pass to have effects on his plays that seem to satisfy him, as he beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the best time, another.
Maybe that's the real art of selection.
My inclination would be to give Bopara his chance, which doesn’t mean that Shah doesn’t stand out, as the tea leaves suggest, it’s him who plays here this weekend.
Buses Bring Refugees Back to Work - and Fighting Al-Qaeda
The first buses with Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, expelling the exiles who were left without cash, without visa extensions and those who expected the city to return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the militants who drove them out of their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy consisting of a dozen buses, the terminal was full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned by private transportation.
“I decided to go to Syria after they killed many doctors in Baghdad,” said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I’ve read in the newspapers, about what happened in Baghdad and that’s safe now.”
“They say Mahdi’s army has stopped killing people,” he said, referring to the Shiite militia of religious militant Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his troops a temporary cessation.
Qassim al-Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher in the Sunni area of Amariyah, returned with her two children because it was impossible to renew her visa in Syria because the regime does not want Iraqis working in their country.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah phoned him to tell him that an allied U.S. force helped pull al-Qaeda out of his fort west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of Jordan’s newcomers was the head of a Sunni and Shiite tribe that had been driven from his home in Sleikh north of Baghdad by a grenade attack after urging citizens to rise against al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started an anti-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my colleagues.”
"That's why I'm back today," said 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many said they were attracted to the growing calm in the capital since U.S. troops reinforced groups of "concerned citizens", armed and working in cooperation with the U.S. military to defend their neighborhoods.
But many claimed to have returned due to visa denial and lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have settled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51, a father of three, voiced the common suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugee visas to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe they fled the country because of the sectarian squads of death.
“We were fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop granting visas to Iraqis, to force them back to Iraq,” he said.
“I can’t believe in a government that supports the criminals who burned my house after I left it.”
Part of the reason for the cessation of violence is that the Sunnis have been expelled from the Shia areas and vice versa, relaxing tensions.
There is a fear that a sudden wave of refugees will bring back sectarian tensions and start the fight.
The little Sarre, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and even shines by the international orientation of its higher schools.
As in the whole country, Sardinians lack only one educational field.
“Yesterday I explained for the fiftieth time to a non-Sarlander that we are not French,” that was the ironic motto of the smallest federal state for its fiftieth anniversary.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the education system of the Sarre which in a study by the German Institute of Economics (IW) called "Bildungsmonitor" took fifth place.
Thus, by tradition, high schools have good relations with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To date, students can finish their university career here with two or three diplomas.
As a result, the percentage of foreign students is high, of 15.6%.
However, the number of students from the Sarre is higher than the average in high schools, many of whom do not have a bachelor's degree.
“The system of vocational education is exploited in the Sarre,” says Axel Plünnecke, an expert in the education sector at the German Institute of Economics (IW).
More than one in five young people complete their bachelor’s degree at the Professional School, so it turns out that the Sarre is 7 percent above the national average.
On the contrary, the variety the range of possibilities for a professional-academic education is very wide.
The offer of double races, in terms of population, is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical professional training and growing demand, the number of graduates in Engineering Sciences has fallen by one-third in recent years.
That was the reason why the Sarre Ministry of Education forced higher schools to advertise more for the specialties in Engineering Sciences.
“After the first PISA study, we have made some reforms in general education schools,” a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education said.
Thus, the government introduced comparative tests across the country.
For children to start studying the last year of the project called "Kita-Jahr", it has no cost. Meanwhile, this model is also imitated by other federal states.
The comparison with the upcoming studies will show whether the student’s performance has increased.
According to the 2003 PISA report, the number of pupils behind school development decreased from 29 to 20 percent.
But, in general, the Sarre did not improve much like other federal states.
In Bavaria, students can better calculate.
To the displeasure of Sardinians, the PISA report does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages, although good results could be achieved in this field.
Although the Sardinians are not French, the language of the neighbors is a compulsory subject at the Secondary Education Institutes.
Chavez changes the time.
Soon there will be another time zone different from the rest of the world in Venezuela.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez lets change the time in the South American country by delaying the clock for half an hour.
Chávez is currently staying as a comedian in Spain.
As reported by the Venezuelan State Bulletin, according to the new law, the hour will pass to less than four hours GMT.
This way the South American country will have a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Among other things, Chávez, as the enemy of the United States, justifies his decision by saying that the United States would impose on its day the obligation to the world by changing a full hour.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time) Chávez announced the breakup of relations with his neighbor Colombia due to hostage action.
The left-wing nationalist said he would not maintain any relationship with either the head of state or the Colombian government until the conservative <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Uribe remained the president of Colombia.
“My dignity does not allow me to do so,” says Chávez, who is propelling a constitutional reform where the citizens of the oil country must decide on Sunday in a referendum.
With this reform, its power in the country could be greatly expanded.
The reason for the conflict was Uribe’s decision to withdraw Chavez’s mandate in negotiations with the Marxist guerrilla in which it was about the liberation of hostages.
On Sunday, Chávez said criticizing that Uribe’s decision has offended Venezuela.
There is also a lot of talk about Chávez in Spain.
A new tone of call causes sensation in the country: “Why don’t you shut up?” is the phrase that has already been downloaded by half a million people.
This phrase was pronounced by the King of Spain who was upset by the ongoing interruptions by left-wing populists at the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007, the decline in real wages threatened the Germans.
According to a forecast, a decline in real wages this year threatens German employees despite a strong conjunction.
Experts present a lot of reasons for a pessimistic forecast.
According to the Hans Böckler Foundation’s calculations, German employees are expected to have a lower real salary account in 2007 than in the previous year.
“The fault of that is the weak evolution of wages, the increase in value-added tax and the stretching of food and energy prices,” Gustav Horn of the Institute of Macroeconomics and Economic Cycles Research reported to the Bild newspaper.
The new burdens of unemployment insurance may also correspond to employees.
Finance Minister Peter Setinbrück told the Neue Ostanbrücker Zeitung that given the current situation, the intention to reduce the unemployment insurance burden by 3.3% over the course of the year is fair and reasonable.
Of course, the office does not have to put itself back in an unpleasant situation, asking for credits and subsidies to the Federal State, according to the words of a German Social Democratic Party politician.
On Tuesday, it was made public that the inflation rate with price explosions in the food and oil derivatives sector reached its highest level in 13 years.
Compared to last year, prices are rising by 3%.
Venus: Earth's twin brother.
Although its atmosphere is not suitable for life, Venus is the most Earth-like planet, something that had not yet been posed. The European probe "Venus Express" discovered rays in the atmosphere and swirls in the poles, the same ones that appear also in winter on Earth.
For the past three decades, researchers had suspected that rays could exist on Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new tests: it has discovered electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus, the rays shut down at a height of 54 kilometers from one cloud and behind another, says Cris Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles to the scientific journal "Nature".
According to Urey-Miller’s famous model of the origin of life, rays caused life on Earth: storms could have caused reactions in the ocean that, in turn, would have given rise to the amino acids that are the basic components of life.
In Venus it is not so: if there was life there one day, that would have to be in one of the first states of evolution,” explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, there can be no life on the surface of Venus: atmospheric pressure is almost 100 times higher than on Earth and on the surface there are temperatures of 500<0xC2><0xB0>C, oscillating in such a way that temperatures can be reached below zero.
"Possibly, Venus is a "diabolic" twin on Earth, but it's still a twin," Russell said.
The main objective of the Venus Express mission is to answer the question of why Venus, so similar to Earth by its mass and size, has evolved so differently.
Since there have been no special missions since the 1990s, only for the exploration of this planet, the launch of "Venus-Express" in November 2005 was a very important step for the exploration of Venus.
The latest findings of the research that will be presented in many "Nature" articles, according to the researchers, not only underscore the uniqueness of Venus in the Solar System.
“This also demonstrates that neighboring planets have more features in common with Earth than we had assumed,” the ESA reports.
Despite the already known stormy winds in the North Pole, researchers have discovered in the southern polar region also a vortex formed by clouds that rotate faster.
This phenomenon is reminiscent of wind flows in the high atmospheric layers of the poles, according to a team of researchers from Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Special Astrophysics and Space Physics.
The second planet in the Solar System has almost the same mass as Earth and with its equatorial diameter of 12,000 kilometers it is almost as large.
This planet is also called an dawn star or evening star orbiting the Sun almost 225 days.
But its rotation period is slower: a day on Venus is equivalent to 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and its atmospheric pressure of 92 bars is not very similar to Earth, scientists start from the basis that both planets had formed under the same conditions.
On both planets there had been a lot of water left on Earth in the oceans, but on Venus it dissociated into the universe.
While carbon dioxide had become carbon stones on Earth, Venus forms most of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended Merkel's mitin with the Dalai Lama.
Koehler, the Federal President, insists on ending the fight between the parties for the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Federal Chancellorship.
He indirectly criticized the German Social Democratic Party for its attacks on the Federal Chancellor after the September rally.
Horst Koehler, the Federal President, is concerned about Germany’s reputation and therefore demanded that the great coalition end that fight for the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"In this case we should not present ourselves as a divided nation," Koehler told the "Handelsblatt" newspaper.
At the same time, Koehler showed his understanding of the reception of the Dalai Lama by Angela Merkel (Party of the Christian Democratic Union) in September.
“Although I have a great respect for the difference between cultures, human rights are of absolute validity for me,” Koehler said.
Everyone knows that Germany has to act with great balance in terms of foreign policy, the Federal President stresses, defending Merkel for the rebuttal he received in conducting a new policy with China.
"The Federal Chancellor has not taken a distance from the traditional course of a China policy.
China knows that too,” Koehler said.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the Minister of Foreign Affairs (Social Democratic Party), had indirectly shown his disgust at the reception of the Dalai Lama and was therefore attacked by the members of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier criticized the Union for its inoperable foreign policy.
The reception of the Dalai Lama in the Federal Chancellorship caused major misunderstandings in Chinese-German relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only withdrew the invitation to Peer Steinbrueck (Social Democratic Party), Germany’s Finance Minister, but also, according to information sources from Spiegel magazine, froze the so-called strategic dialogue of the foreign ministries of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, the head of the Chinese government, demanded that Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel recognize this reception of the Dalai Lama as a mistake.
Affirming China’s position, Wen Jiabao said China would not accept European politicians receiving Tibetans’ religious leader in their official position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama showed that he is trying to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now includes other provinces as well.
Schaeuble warns that there will be riots like those in France.
Battles with police on the streets, shootings, burning cars: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns that riots will occur as was the case in France.
The Federal Minister demands that every effort be made to prevent social dissatisfaction in Germany from being taken to the streets.
Barricades were made, vandals fired guns at the police: after serious youth-starred riots in France, Federal Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble (Democratic Union Party) fears similar trends in Germany.
“We have to make sure that our country’s social problems don’t take a violent form.”
"That's what we have to take seriously," he said in the newspaper "Neue Presse", published in Hannover.
Not all young people develop into the constant change of social reality.
The Federal State, federal states and municipalities are already working with emphasis on solving these problems, Schaeuble said.
This is not just about the integration of immigrants.
“From the Integration Summit to the Conference of Islam: All this is already bearing its first fruits.”
It’s still too early to end the alarm.
At the same time Schaeuble indicated that the German suburbs do not have the same building and sociological problems as they do in France.
The youths starred in serious riots on the streets with the police north of Paris last night.
Toulouse also burned cars and public buildings.
The President of the Turkish Community in Germany, Kenan Kolat, demanded greater efforts from the Federal Government for integration.
Kolat, in view of the riots in France, warns of an imitating effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
After all, the performances are necessary.
Kolat indicated that the unemployment rate among young people of foreign origin under the age of 25 is above average.
It is important to ensure that there are more vocational training positions.
Kolat stresses: “We need to give a perspective to young people.”
The President of the Turkish Community added that in Germany more than in France "there is great social control in families", greater than the French country.
In addition, most young people of foreign origin do not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat says, "But despite everything, we have to be careful."
We must “provide the opportunity for young people to receive a job or vocational training job faster.”
Meanwhile, the night in the Parisian suburb of Villiers-le-Bel went peacefully.
Hundreds of policemen participated in the action, a helicopter with lighthouses flew over the territory.
Responsible authorities reported three arrests, as well as garbage and burned cars.
Since the day before, a team of nearly 1,000 police officers has been taking care of security.
After seeing a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Interior Minister, announced that the police would take strict measures until necessary.
Around 80 policemen were injured in riots in Villiers-le-Bel on Monday night.
The riots continued the following night in Toulouse.
The disturbance began with a traffic accident on Sunday, where two young people died.
According to information provided by the prosecution, the deaths of the young were not the fault of the police.
In the Kingdom of Angela Cloude.
The performance, far from the reality of the Federal Chancellor, demonstrates that the coalition in terms of content has reached its final point and that nothing more needs to be expected from it.
But in which country does the Chancellor really live?
After her desperate, indifferent and inconsequential performance in the general debate of the Lower House, one must say: she does not live in a country that would have to be governed by her.
With regard to the accusation made to him for repeatedly engaged in foreign policy performances, the Chancellor rejected it with a presumptuous sentence.
He said that would be a provincial mode and thus showed that he doesn’t want to understand what interests critics.
In the Lower House, it was very explicitly stated to all that reproach was appropriate.
You could not feel a minimum of interest, or any kind of feeling for the problems of the country.
But instead, Angela Cloude presented herself in this way: a very high policy that runs away in foreign policy and remains there without achieving anything concrete.
One example: the prevention of climate change: she praised herself very much for the decisions made in Heiligendamm, but she does not say anything about how these climate goals should be achieved here.
In general, this way of praising herself – for two years the head of the Democratic Union Party has not been able to afford so much modesty.
So he is engaged in expressions to get a boost to people.
And thus it damages its public image by the pragmatic conception with which it solves problems without going through the branches.
But in Angela Cloude's realm, the inner problems are appearances of little value.
The poverty of children and concerns for low-wage workers?
The only thing he is dedicated to is to talk about this subject using subordinate prayers.
It’s amazing how many times you’re wrong about talking when it comes to children’s supplements.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to be able to formulate a more or less good sentence.
It begins to stumble "as if it had been in an unknown territory", when it was more concrete information.
The attack section.
The two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, made a confrontation in a heated debate of YouTube’s Republican presidential candidates and now should fear only one outsider.
The tensions between the candidates were noted from the outset.
Mitt Romney blamed his opponent Rudy Giuliani for making New York a “refugee for illegal immigrants.”
He, for his part, responded with serious accusations: "I would like to say that his own house was a "gate" to the illegals." Giuliani replied to the former governor of Massachusetts saying that he was the one who hired the paperless illegal immigrants.
Candidates tend to attack: as the Republican group so far has no clear favorite, the eight presidential candidates take advantage of the debate on CNN, especially to discredit their opponents.
The small 30-second videos, shot by internet users who were sent to Youtube, also have little content.
“With this mode of isolation we let Hitler come to power,” that was John McCain’s rebuttal to his opponent Ron Paul, the only one at the meeting that insisted on immediately withdrawing Iraqi troops.
Romney also receives many criticisms from veterans of the Vietnam War, when he refuses to recognize as torture the "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation, by letting a person drown simulate his death.
Public reactions in the room in St. Petersburg, Florida show that in the meantime, the most important issues of the campaign are others, not just the war in Iraq or the debates on torture.
The public always applauded very strongly when they praised conservative values and denied rising taxes.
This way you can better see where the weaknesses of both favorites are.
“At that time, I was wrong,” Romney explains confused and apologizes to people and the television audience for having been an abortion advocate in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, did not know what to say when asked what he thought of the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time Musharraf ruled without uniform.
A day after his resignation as head of the army, the Pakistani president was sworn in as president.
This is the end of the eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
On Thursday, Pakistan’s President Pervez Musharraf took an oath for a second five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the Presidential Palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the constitution and to act for the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, he transferred his mandate as head of the army to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus accepted international pressure, especially on the part of the United States.
Eight years after he was made in power with an incredulous military coup, the former general first ruled the state as a civilian chief.
With his resignation as Head of the Armed Forces, Musharraf fulfilled the main condition of the opposition and the West.
The other requirement is the end of the state of emergency, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on November 3.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyum, the Attorney General of the State, after the oath of office Musharraf will soon cancel the state of emergency and meet the second condition of the West.
Since the state of emergency was proclaimed in the Supreme Court, many jurists have been in favour of Musharraf. Last week the country’s Supreme Court rejected all appeals before the controversial new election of the head of government on October 6.
Meanwhile, in an attack on a military convoy in the North Watiristan region, five soldiers were killed and four others were wounded.
According to an army spokesman, a bomb exploded on one of the streets on the border with Afghanistan.
The founders of Krautrock are back.
The most famous German band of the 1970s continues its activity: three members of "Harmony" took part in a concert in Berlin.
A re-recorded copy of "Live 1974" was written at the band's best time.
Already in those days they were very famous in foreign countries.
The attendance of these three gentlemen to an official meal caused the feeling.
Each of them has in front of them their drawer, their cables and above all their buttons.
In the middle is seated Dieter Moebius who is 63 years old and is dressed in a white shirt.
On his left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has his laptop and the guitar.
To the right, looking from the auditorium, is Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73, who is very busy with the control panel.
Each contributes with their sounds, among them there is even rhythm.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
This doesn't seem to bother the gentlemen.
A very exciting thing for Krautrock fans was the fact that the band Harmonia was making music again.
What you have to rebel here is the following: the questions have accurately shown that the band’s name retumbated in people’s minds, but it wasn’t something so special that after 32 years the audience would miss it so much.
But why can’t the Germans also applaud their lively 1970s legend?
Especially because the misguided Krautrock was always more valued in England and the United States than in his own country.
When the entertainment industry awarded a "Echo" music award to members of the Can 2003 band from Cologne for their life work, the room was able to see the surprised faces of German pop artists.
And when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the band La Düsseldorf und Neu!, they all opened their mouths with amazement.
Later, Michael Rother spent time on stage during the Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts as if he had been an old friend (of the band).
Ignorance in your country and recognition abroad are one thing.
It’s a problem to remember this band, because the trio only existed for two years and in those times I didn’t get a big effect on the audience, however, it later got it thanks to the others.
Some time ago, Moebius and Roedelius had made music with the artist Conrad Schnitzler and had a name, Cluster, which promised a lot of fame.
At first they played in the basement of Berliner Schaubuehne.
Then, for economic reasons, they worked with a music company in Duesseldorf that was sponsored by a church.
For a while, Rother had a job at Kraftwerk and then worked as a guitarist on the band Neu! He managed to improve the reputation of this German band that was too radical at the time.
In 1973, Rother followed Cluster musicians in Forst's exile in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, which is a ruin of the 16th century, they lived as refugees from the city.
The way of life was less ideological than in Common I, where Roedelius could complain about his position.
That was rather a life of artists full of surprises.
According to them, one day a Ottenstein Harmony singing association banner appeared in the garbage, which turned out to be a good name for art.
There were also disadvantages in the use of the name Harmonia.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia" and the second "De Lux".
Although the music was quiet and simple, the band had financial problems.
Life as an artist wasn’t just about getting to know yourself.
The CD "Live 1974" was recorded during a concert in Griessem. Someone remembers that almost 50 people participated in this recording.
Then Rother expressed his desire to propel Harmony and do rehearsals from time to time.
For Roedelius and Moebius this demand is against the customs.
In 1975 the band announced their separation.
Rother eventually got into esoteric subjects and assured his existence with albums such as "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster revived the 1980s and has since been more successful than Harmonia had.
The live recording of the album on Griessmer, that is to be thanked to Groenemeyer.
His music company Grienland aimed to cultivate its own German contribution to preserve it as live music.
Like the work of Roedelius, the band Neu! was also rediscovered.
The presentation of Harmonia as a band takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
The band was subsidized with public measures from the Wordtronics festival.
There is Julian Cope, the Englishman, the old punk and the author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
Thus, all of Krautrock’s influences on the following pop music are present.
Harmony takes the position of a super-band, a position that was empty.
Brian Eno’s phrase, accompanied by special music, fills the room: “This music is the only true music, it belongs to the future.”
There are photos where Harmonia appears with producers on a farm.
The story of the legend’s development is shown in black and white photo projections, where wired instruments are seen.
At the bottom there are three veterans who started improvising again.
They do nothing but fix the microphones to the organ and to the battery to be able to produce extraordinary tones with the help of the effects apparatus they had built with their own hands.
Nowadays, electronic music is the way it should be.
Three people who deepen in the technique.
But that doesn't change anything.
Under the direction of Bárbara Morgenstern, in a musical environment she coughs, whispers and in a good moment of emphasis sings "Aaaaaaaah!"
Krautrock has always been a term of English origin.
But it was never rock.
The origin of the genre was not sought in blues, but in music schools (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or by escaping artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Who here shouts "68!" is also right, but now Harmonia keeps calm.
On the stage, he reflects very well on what is already evident.
Where does the music start and end?
That can break one’s nerves or give a quick moment of luck.
Richard Gere only lacks more cynicism.
The two films "The Hunting Party" and "Moerderischer Frieden" are once again dedicated to the war in the Balkans.
But the two did not have much conviction.
Either the concepts get too fixed on actions and shootings or both movies are too exciting.
Richard Gere with his "The Hunting Party" can't help in this case either.
At first there was good news: Karadzic and Mladic, the war criminals, continue to hide in the Balkan mountain, but precisely there, in the dark interior of the country during the Bosnian War, actor Richard Gere was rediscovered.
We had finally lost sight of the most beautiful man of the 1980s, because no one wanted to see him after his pleasant and unimportant roles in women’s films and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, suddenly, Richard Gere is the most important argument to see perhaps the movie "The Hunting Party - When a hunter becomes what he pursues" (Why do movie titles have to be so long and silly these days?).
The film has a wonderful presentation for viewing: in the background, his role as a reporter in the war is the presentation of what Richard Gere could do, if the destiny and the film industry had not been so merciful to him. He was a man whose better times of life had already passed, who as a monument of the ruin of his greater decadence.
"The Hunting Party", despite this triumph, along with "Moerderischer Frieden" which is German production and will also be presented this week, turns out to be just a series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
The film "Moerderischer Frieden" can be narrated in a few words: it is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serbian from Kosovo snipers, one of them acts very quickly and that also leads him to fall in love with her.
The meaning of the film is lost by the actions and shootings, although we celebrate that the Serbs are not once again presented as the only culprits.
The film is like the German series "Alarm for Cobra 11" without a highway, but in a situation of war.
In the example of "The Hunting Party" one can investigate, because there has never actually been a good movie about the war in the Balkans.
At another time, with another director and with another screenwriter (Richard Shepard on two charges), the story about American reporters in the war who go to detect a war criminal Serb called "the monster", could probably be a new "Apocalypse Now".
So, the stories are surprisingly similar: small teams go to the mountain twice to do something the army can’t do and each time it turns out to be a crazy journey.
One reason for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is when we first introduce Simon Hunt, who is not allowed to be just a cynic with a heart.
No, the script also predicts a love adventure with a Muslim Bosnian who will later kill.
Then "The Hunting Party" is very far from reality, especially when in the last five minutes reporters with an impressive speed achieve what they could not achieve for five years NATO, the CIA and all the world's head hunters, which was to capture the war criminal and leave the Bosnians just a form of Muslims to see themselves.
It is so bad, that they are eager to appeal to the international court in The Hague based on crimes against cinematic logic.
However, the purpose of the film is, in fact, a deeply humane one.
The film wants to condemn the fact that Karad<0xC5><0xBE>i<0xC4><0x87> and Mladi<0xC4><0x87> are still free, and stresses that the Americans and the French are not really concerned about chasing them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes good and bad are so similar, that one comes to mind a very famous poem by Brecht.
In this poem it is a mask of an Asian demon: "In the great wrinkles of his forehead I see, sharing his feelings with him, that it is hard to be bad."
In movies like "The Hunting Party" there are also these demons but they show that it's hard to be good.
The problem is not just the genre of war films in the Balkans.
Recently in a newspaper he published that all films about Iraq produced in Hollywood are fake.
It can also be added that there has never been a good movie about South Africa.
Almost always a rule is valid: when a star gets caught up in a crisis region or minefields, then something like "Rangoon" appears with Patricia Arguette, "On the other side of all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blood Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Possibly all these conflicts occurred in a short space of time.
They have to wait at least decades until Hollywood makes a good movie about the Holocaust with the movie "Schindler's List" as an example.
Some films already need more time. Classics such as the Vietnam War works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" in their time were not celebrated unanimously as the masterpieces.
Today we may know too much about global conflicts, and that is why in our time every massacre (Massenmord) is presented directly on two televisions at home.
And that’s because scriptwriters don’t have the slightest repair (which is necessary to be able) to tell good stories.
“To be or not to be” or “The Great Dictator” ultimately turned out to be so good, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still didn’t know how bad the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you shouldn’t be a good person to make a movie.
Perhaps he must be like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic and distant look of an artist.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel "Dictionary of Lemprière" and the war in the Balkans, he replied: "It's only because some things never change."
Great cities will always be in danger, men will always be brutally murdered and war will always reign in Yugoslavia.
Von Beust receives the negative criticism of the Olympics as a response.
The mayor of Hamburg has received many criticisms of politics and the economy for not applying for the Summer Olympics.
Many want to keep fighting for the competitions in the water sports section.
But Beust recalls that you have to be realistic when estimating possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, director general of the Chamber of Commerce in Hamburg, said this resignation was “not good for the economic location.”
In recent times no other project in the big city has encouraged as much motivation as the idea of organizing the Olympic Games.
“Without this goal, the political, sporting impulse could not be maintained at the same level.”
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to forget this project, but to find a new long-term application "referring to another time".
On Wednesday, Mayor Ole von Beust held his statements that Hamburg’s ambitions in organizing the Summer Olympics would not be realized until at least the year 2028.
"Hamburg doesn't decide on the application for the Olympics, but the German Olympic Sports Federation decides," von Beust said on WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sportbund expected in early December on Munich's request for the 2028 Winter Olympics.
“This preference means for us that in this time period, which we thought we had until 2028, we will have no chance from a realistic point of view.”
After all, this dream did not end forever, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regrets the statements by von Beut.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympics.
“It’s too soon to let go of the opportunity, if at this point the plans are ruined,” HSB director Günter Ploß said on Wednesday.
A resignation of the application is contrary to the statement of the head of the Senate that he made at a reception on the occasion of the General Meeting of the German Higher Schools Public Sports Federation (adh).
There von Beust designated Hamburg’s 2015 University application not as a “substitute” of the Hamburg Olympics.
Last week alone, the High School Sports Federation appointed Hamburg as a candidate for the application.
The Social Democratic Party (SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraktion) has blamed the senate for not taking advantage of such valuable time to build houses in Hamburg.
"For many years, the Senate was delaying the development of the small Grasbrook neighborhood, because it was on plans for the Olympic Games or the construction of houses," said Carola Veit and Jan Quast, MPs for the German Social Democratic Party (SPD).
While the SPD always demanded an integrated Olympic planning for the small Grasbrook and then the use of the built houses, the CDU emphasized the importance of entertainment.
At that time, Hamburg’s request for the 2012 Summer Olympics sparked great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
They're not wooden boxes.
Who relates the terms Sweden and wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but does not think of Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently the wooden boxes produced in Sweden are like the shadow weighing on Warhol's list of works.
Most of the ninety-four Bright-Box "type" on this list are fake.
After a few months ago the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" circulated doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhol's 1968 Brillo-Boxes, the Moderna Museet Museum in Stockholm conducted internal investigations and came to disappointing conclusions: the six other "Brillo-Boxes" are also the "Museos", which are in the "Museo-Boxes", which the former director-museet redirector of Modern.
Prehistory is too complicated with a confusing relationship between artistic and sponsored productions.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York City, painting the wooden boxes of red, blue and white, with the same sample that they had "Brillo" soap powder cartons.
According to Warhol, at the exhibition of his works in 1968 at the Moderna Museet museum were exhibited hundreds of Brillo-cartons. These were not made by Warhol (because of the expenses), but they were brought directly from the "Brillo" carton factory.
These were not artworks, but specimens (which were only objects) exposed.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol allowed to produce in Sweden some Wooden Brilliant Boxes, but they were not exhibited at the Modern Museet Museum.
Witnesses of that time now speak of nearly fifteen boxes, which at that time entered the history of art and auctions as originals of the "Brillo-Boxes" of "Stockholm type" authorised by Andy Warhol.
Some of them were purchased at auction for more than <0x24>100,000.
The problem is that after the famous museum director Pontus Hulten made false statements that in 1968 in Sweden were produced and exposed almost a hundred of the wooden boxes that Warhol left to him.
But in reality, 105 boxes were produced in the same year 1990 in Malmö for Hulten and for the exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By this time Warhol had already died three years ago.
Lars Byström, the head of the Conservatives of the Museum Moderna Museet, investigated six Brillo-Boxes owned by the museum and also three of the Swedish private property that were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm.
On the contrary, the structure of the 1990 copies shows that the painting was applied with a roll without directly printing the squeezed silvers. Moreover, it is not about oil painting, but acrylic painting.
"These boxes have not been authorised by the artist and must be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Bright Boxes," says Lars Nittve, director of the Moderna Museet Museum and adds that if the "Andy Warhol Art" Authentication Commission in New York will not reach any conclusion, the Moderna Museet Museum will classify them as ex-boxes.
In July, the Authentication Commission formally announced that it accepts these "grave allegations" of soap powder boxes.
But from that moment on, everything remained in absolute silence.
Rebel soldiers surrender in Manila.
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers have surrendered to a hotel in Manila and have demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The head coach Antonio Trillanes, who blames the president for corruption and electoral fraud, told a reporter he could not answer for shedding blood.
Soldiers loyal to the government had raided the hotel using tear gas.
Almost two hundred soldiers had been trapped in the building for a few hours.
Almost half of them, including Trillans, had a trial on Thursday for attempting a coup in 2003 that ended in a failure.
He took advantage of the negotiations, to be able to suddenly deposit with about 30 sympathizers.
Obviously, the military police who were supposed to watch him had passed to his ranks and followed his motto.
They entered the Peninsula hotel and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government troops blockaded the neighborhood in the vicinity of the Noble Hotel.
The president called for an urgent meeting of the Security Office.
Norberto Gonzales, the national security adviser, condemned the conduct of the soldiers.
"People are tired," said Trillanes.
"We call on people to move on to our ranks."
General Danilo Lim, who had previously led the elite scout Reangers, said that soon the other military troops wanted to follow the march.
Major government critics summoned a major protest against the president on Thursday.
For months, his government has been accused of corruption.
In 2003 the financial district in Manila was a site that attracted all the attention for the riot that was attempted against Arroyo.
The uprising failed after about 24 hours because the army wanted to participate.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven coup attempts in the Philippines against the democratically elected government.
United Internet will be Versatel’s largest shareholder.
United Internet secured more than 20 percent of the shares of the telecommunications company Versatel.
On Wednesday, the company reported that the average price per share is 14.46 euros.
It has only 20.05 percent of social capital.
There was a lot of speculation about the company’s absorption.
There are also options to further increase the financial share in Versatel.
United Internet said it wants to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) market.
They already made assumptions about entering the business on Wednesday, after Brendenberg increased its stake in the Duesseldorf network operator by 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
In the financial market, that means that the financial institution retains the shareholding securities for a third party partner.
United Internet already on the day before made nearly 10 percent stake in the telecommunications company Drillish.
Drillish in the capital expansion measure put 17.4 million of the new shares worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>106.4 million.
United Internet has purchased 5.15 million shares from them for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>31.4 million.
In addition, the companies began negotiations on DSL-product marketing cooperation.
“We are strengthening our collaboration,” said the spokesman for United Internet.
The two companies founded an MSP joint venture to acquire competitor Freenet.
On Thursday, United Internet reported that at the outset, the two companies wanted to be happy with ten percent participation in Freenet and did not make use of their right, i.e. 18.49 percent participation in Freenet.
This meant that both companies kept all options, especially the participation in the anonymous Freenet society.
The negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This “game” with Freenet that will last for many months and is not very understandable is part of Telecom’s consolidation of the German market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million customers with a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million with a DSL contract or a full contract.
So far, United Internet and Drillish's holdings had a direct 6.01 percent stake in Freenet.
Then they had agreed that Drillish would achieve the other four percent.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of the investment company Vatas was already agreed in August.
