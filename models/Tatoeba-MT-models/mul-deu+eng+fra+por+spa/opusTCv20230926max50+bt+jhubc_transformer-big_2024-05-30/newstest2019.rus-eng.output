Number of new recruits from Ukraine who are preparing to be sent to Donbass
The official representative of the People's Militia of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic (LPR) Andrei Marocko said that in the winter of 2018-2019 Ukraine will send at least 3,000 new recruits to the Donbass.
According to him, this is how Kiev plans "to somehow complete the units".
"The unwillingness of Ukrainian citizens to serve in the ranks of the Ukrainian military, mass redundancies led to a low capacity of units," - said Marocko, quoted by RIA Novosti.
He also did not rule out that the real numbers of Ukrainians called in the army could be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kiev began the so-called anti-terrorist operation (ATO), which was later replaced by the Joint Forces Operation (UNFPA).
It was expected that this measure would lead to a strengthening of the role of Ukrainian troops in resolving the situation.
At the end of August 2018, the situation in Donbass was exacerbated by the murder of DPR head Alexander Zakharchenko.
The DPR authorities described the incident as a terrorist attack.
Several people involved in the blast were detained during the criminal investigation.
According to preliminary data, they confirmed that the diversion was organized by Ukrainian intelligence services.

The head of the British Foreign Ministry compared the EU to the Soviet Union and the prison
Britain’s Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt compared the European Union to the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of capturing members of the community.
This statement was made by the diplomat at the Congress of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham, which opened on Sunday, September 30.
According to the Daily Mail, Hunt commented on the difficulties in the Brexit negotiation process.
What happened to the belief in the European dream and its ideals?
The EU was created to protect freedom, and the Soviet Union did not allow anyone to leave it.
The lesson of history is clear: if you turn the EU from a community into a prison, the desire to leave it will not diminish, it will only grow, and we will not be the only prisoner who will want to escape captivity,” the minister said.
He also added that attempts to punish Britain for the decision to leave the European Union would only exacerbate the crisis, notes Gazeta.ru.
In mid-September, Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May said Brexit talks had gone awry.
So she commented on the results of the informal EU summit in Salzburg.
The Brexit decision was taken in 2016 following the referendum.
The UK’s exit is expected to take place by April 2019, but negotiations with Brussels on this issue are complicated by a number of factors.
In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will interact after London leaves the community.
The question of the Irish border is also open.

Fleming’s name was included in the list of the 100 most outstanding figures in human history.
His discovery, according to many scientists, changed the course of history.
With the help of penicillin, medicine began to cope with most of the ancient diseases, previously considered incurable, - tuberculosis, syphilis, gangrene...
When, shortly after receiving the Nobel Prize, Fleming arrived in the French capital in 1945, the Paris newspapers wrote: "For the breakup of fascism and the liberation of France he has done more than dozens of divisions."
According to experts, Fleming’s discovery of the world’s first antibiotic has saved the lives of more than 200 million people on Earth.
Alexander Fleming died in his home in London in 1955 of a heart attack.
He was cremated, and a week later his dust was buried in the famous London cathedral of St. Paul.
Where, by the way, our wife and I paid attention to this was a word-provoking Russian-speaking tour guide.
And a few years later the statue of Alexander Fleming in full growth we had to observe in the most unexpected place for this place in the capital of Spain.
There, near the main arena for the Corridor of Plaza de Toros de Las Ventas, the most famous Spanish madadors established a monument to the man whose efforts have saved, in their opinion, the lives of hundreds of outstanding corridor masters.
By the way, this, in my opinion, very interesting porcelain work was found by me there, in Madrid, but at another time and not at all about it.

Trump talks about "love" in Kim Jong-un
“From the cruelty of each other, the leaders of the United States and North Korea have barely fallen in love with each other,” Trump jokes.
U.S. President Donald Trump made a successful joke about his successes on the North Korean crisis settlement front.
Starting with mutual threats of annihilation, the leaders of the two countries have now improved their relationship so much that they hardly fall in love with each other, the president said.
The owner of the White House recalled that he had accepted from the previous administration the North Korean problem as the main complexity in foreign policy.
Trump noted that Barack Obama’s team had started such a relationship with the DPRK that it could not even call the country’s leadership — they simply didn’t pull the pipe.
At the time, the US and North Korea were on the brink of war, and today the North Korean leader is writing “beautiful letters” to the White House, Trump said.
Trump acknowledged that at the beginning of his work he was also “violent” to Kim Jong-un, which, however, was mutual.
However, now their relationship has improved to such an extent that the leaders “love each other.”
At the same time, Trump asked not to take his words literally and warned that the American media would interpret them as incompetent.
Trump pointed out that Pyongyang has recently stopped nuclear and missile tests, as well as shutting down military polygons.
All these are the merits of his administration, the American president is sure.
Last Tuesday, Donald Trump spoke out loud about Kim Jong-un from the UN General Assembly tribune.
Trump thanked the North Korean leader for his courage and the steps taken to de-escalate tensions.
Trump said the sanctions against North Korea will continue until the Korean peninsula is fully denuclearized.
Negotiations in Singapore
On June 12, the first talks between the US and North Korea leaders were held in Singapore.

Positive results of the meeting were the cessation of nuclear and missile tests by the DPRK, as well as the return to the U.S. of the remains of U.S. troops in the country.
At the same time, other practical steps towards North Korea’s denuclearization are still being taken.
The media reported that after the Singapore summit, the U.S. sent several disarmament scenarios to the DPRK, but Pyongyang rejected them, calling them "gangsters".

Nietzsche called for “Moscow language to be a Ukrainian product”
The Ukrainian children’s writer and fighter for the purity of the native language Larisa Nicey called for the expulsion of “Russian-speaking Moscow product and Moscow language” from Ukraine.
To do this she offers a Ukrainian product - "cultural wave, cultural pressure".
His views on the "property of eradicating the Russian language in Ukraine" were shared by Nizha with the Ukrainian edition "Observer".
According to her, the corresponding Ukrainian product is now being prepared - it already exists and continues to develop further.
Over time, Ukrainians are "striking" from this "Moscow language", she is convinced.
For example, in neighboring Poland, according to her, Russian language was previously widely used in television and radio, but it has virtually not remained in public space.
At the same time, according to Nietzsche, Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities prohibiting the use of the Russian language, in her opinion, are only "an extension of the borders for Ukrainian speech at the legislative level".
Earlier, Nice shared the experience of maintaining the "Ukrainian-language regime" in a children's camp in the Carpathians, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened by a court of a network of bookstores Watsons, the cashier of which communicated with her in Russian.
Without getting her, Nicholas slipped into the girl's surrender.
The use of Russian words by Ukrainians is called "language schizophrenia", urging Ukrainians to refrain from Russian letters even in the writing of surnames.
Nicey recently said that the name "Russian" was stolen from Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Moscow.
The writer’s anger failed to escape even the Security Service of Ukraine: coming there and hearing the conversations of employees with each other in Russian, she made a scandal and left, knocking at the door.
During the break they had a male conversation, and it brought their fruit.
Defender of "Ural" Denis Kulakov - about the victory over "Arsenal" (2:1) in the game of the ninth round of the Russian championship.
"Dennis, why do you think you've won?"
“I think we wanted to win more,” says Kulakov’s official website Ural.
"This difficult game happened, they had a serious men's conversation during the break, and it brought their fruit: they scored two balls and did not miss.
"You missed a few games because of the damage you suffered earlier this month.
How did you feel today?”
"If you can hold 90 minutes, it's all right!
Actually, I felt good.
Maybe at the end of a little bit of power so that nothing happens.
And so, the doctor and physiotherapist Vladimir Anatolyevich Gashnev led me to this game, for which thank you so much!
“What about the atmosphere in the team?”
“It’s no secret for anyone that after winning and recovering it is easier, and the mood in the team is good.
Now we have a white stripe, although at first it was black.
We need to continue in the same spirit and be happy with the fans.”
"Did you miss the game when you didn't go out on the field?"
“There’s something that I missed a little bit, because really, an unpleasant situation came out.
But again, thank you to the physiotherapist and the doctors for putting it on your feet.
The most important thing is that we won and cheered the fans.
And the rest is secondary."

At the referendum in Macedonia, violations were recorded
Four incidents related to violations of electoral law have been registered in the Republic of Macedonia in a referendum on the intergovernmental treaty with Greece on renaming.
This was reported on Sunday by the press secretary of the Ministry of the Interior, Tony Angelovsky.
Since the opening of the polling stations, four incidents have been recorded, which have been eliminated, he said.
In the polling station of the primary school "Lazo Angelovski" in Skopje, 22-year-old K.J. violated public order and tranquility, insulted citizens and attacked police officers.
He was arrested and taken to the police station.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, all the perpetrators were immediately taken to the police stations.
The Ministry noted that all violations were being investigated.
“The Ministry will act in accordance with the law so that citizens can peacefully exercise the constitutional right to freely express their will.
We call on citizens to comply with the laws and to refrain from any violations of public order and tranquility and any violation of the secrecy of voting,” the Ministry of Interior said.
Citizens are invited to answer one question during the referendum on Sunday: “Do you support membership in the EU and NATO by accepting an agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Greek Republic?”
The referendum is called to resolve the 27-year dispute between Macedonia and Greece over the name of the former Yugoslav Republic, which coincides with the name of the northern Greek region.
The Heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Macedonia and Greece signed an agreement on the new official designation of the former Yugoslav Republic on June 17 during a ceremonial ceremony on the shores of Lake Prespa, which crosses the border between the two countries.
It provides for the use of the name "Republic of North Macedonia".
This treaty should not only solve a long-standing dispute over the name of the country, but also pave the way for Skopje to NATO and the EU.
Syria’s foreign minister: Russia’s decision on the supply of S-300 is a timely step
Russia’s decision to supply S-300 anti-aircraft missile systems to Syria is a timely step.
This opinion was expressed by Syrian Foreign Minister Valid Muallem in an interview with RT, which aired on Sunday.

I want to say that this is a very timely step, and we are very grateful to Russia in this regard for its efforts," the minister said.
The head of the Syrian Foreign Ministry also stressed that the S-300 is a defensive, not offensive system, and it is intended to protect the Syrian skies.
Pashinyan hopes to hold early parliamentary elections in Armenia in 2018
Armenian parliamentary elections can be held in 2018, the country's Prime Minister Nikola Pashinyan said.
"It is not excluded, until the end of the year," the head of government replied to the question of journalists about the deadlines for their conduct (interfax quote).
Mr Pashinyan also did not rule out the fact that he would "take people out to the streets again" to hold extraordinary elections if the discussion of this issue with the parliamentary forces was unsuccessful.
But I'm willing to negotiate with the parliamentary forces.
I hope they are also prepared for a constructive dialogue,” the Prime Minister quoted the Armenian News as saying.
Pashinyan added that the early elections are “the demand of the people” as well as part of the government’s program, which the parliament voted for.
“The long-term vision of the government,” he said, is also necessary to attract investment and the development of the economy.
At the UN General Assembly in New York, Pashinyan promised after returning to Yerevan to begin "negotiations with representatives of all parliamentary and non-parliamentary forces to discuss the timing and conditions of early elections".
In the current parliament, about half of the MPs represent the Republican Party of Armenia (RPA) to the opposition leader Pashinyan.
Premature voting is not possible without the dissolution of parliament, and there are no legitimate reasons for this yet.

Prosecution for Dagestan Deputy became news
The Soviet District Court of Mahachkala has sentenced the Dagestan People’s Assembly MP Rajab Abdulatipova to two months in custody, suspected of participating in a criminal community that constituted a disability for bribes.
"Y" became known the details of the investigation materials that shed light on the fact that, according to the Russian Investigative Committee, the younger brother of the former head of the republic Ramazan Abdulatispova Rajab Abdulatispova and his general counselor Sozhiyyyev now contributed to the criminal actions of the former Mavalitet leader.
Among other things, in the course of the operational exploration activities carried out by the staff of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, it was established that Rajab Abdulatipov lobbyed for the appointment of Magomed Mahachev as the head of the bureau, allegedly receiving 70 million rubles for this.
It should be recalled that earlier, the investigation against Magomed Mahachev, other heads and officials of the territorial medical and social examination offices under his control, was initiated in a criminal case under article 210 (the establishment of a criminal community) (the establishment of a criminal community) and a criminal case (the establishment of a criminal community).
As follows from the investigations, in late 2013, Rajab Abdulatipov, aware of the illegal acts of Mahomad Mahachev and his associates engaged in the theft of the funds of the Pension Fund, joined their activities by joining the criminal community.
In the position of the head of the administration of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Federal Migration Service in Dagestan, and having connections in the authorities and law enforcement bodies, and using their relations with the head of Dagestan, Rajab Abdulatipov, the investigators believe that "they are the other members of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs."
After the disclosure of this information at the hearing of the Soviet District Court on Friday, Rajab Abdulatipov rejected the charges brought against him.
“Of course, everything that is presented to me today as a charge is all new to me, I’m totally unfamiliar with it,” he said.
The court arrested the deputy from "United Russia" not ten days before the indictment, as was the case with the previous high-ranking Dagestan officials, but immediately for two months, as in his case there is an article 210 of the Russian Code.
According to the Criminal Procedure Code, there is much more time for the prosecution to be charged - up to 45 days from the moment of detention.

The relevant statement was made by the Serbian leader during a press conference, reports the local newspaper "Evening News".
According to the source, the head of Serbia clarified that, speaking of the need for support from the Russian side, he does not mean military support on the example of Syria.
Alexander Vucic said he does not want to allow a scenario in which some major military clashes may occur on the territory of the state.
The president of the country has promised to make every effort to preserve the world, the publication said.
We will add that according to information from the Serbian media, the meeting of the heads of Russia and Serbia is scheduled for next Tuesday, 2 October, writes Lenta.ru.
The day before it became known that the Serbian president brought the state army into full combat readiness due to the situation with Kosovo.
This is about the events of last Friday, when several dozen Kosovo special forces entered the territory that adjoins the lake that supplies water to the hydroelectric power plant "Gazivode".
It is clarified that the said GES is located in the territory of Kosovo, but at the same time refers to the Serbian energy system.
Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia a decade ago, but in Belgrade it refused to recognize this fact.
In the spring of last year, the parties had closed negotiations on the issue.

Kosatchev: At the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly, the topic of Russia in the negative key was virtually absent
The head of the Council of the Federation for International Affairs, Konstantin Kosachev, considers the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly to be successful for Russia and does not exclude that it can become a turning point in the perception of Russia as an integral participant in the solution of global problems.
“The uniqueness of the current 73rd session, in my opinion, is that the rhetoric that we have almost become accustomed to in recent years with regard to Russia has now been in a much more subtle way,” the senator said in an interview published on Sunday.
He explained that in previous years, the Russian Federation was sometimes "described as one of the three main threats to humanity, then along with the Ebola fever, along with climate change or terrorism, Russia was one in this rank, in any case, in the exposure of a group of Western countries to what.
At the 73rd session, he stressed, "Russia's theme in the negative key was virtually absent."
"If we carefully analyze the speech of the President of the United States, the President of France, the speech of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Germany, I do not now take Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, at any rate, the choir has not been quite clear," he said, noting that "Russia is no more painful."
The head of the Confederate Profile Committee does not rule out that this indicates some trend, which, in his view, "will highlight the current session [of the UN General Assembly], although in full this trend may manifest itself in a year, two, three."
“I do not exclude that the current session in some sense can be a turnaround,” Kosacchev admitted, explaining that “too many examples of how Russia’s connection is able to move forward in international affairs.”
As an example, he brought up the situation in Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
"Unfortunately, this is not Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be demanded over time," he added.
This is due, he believes, to the emergence of “adequate, healthy perception of Russia as not merely a possible – an integral participant in the solution of the global problems of the present.”
“I don’t want to be wrong, but I have the feeling that we’re going somewhere where the movement will no longer be a backward movement, it will be a forward movement,” he added.
Another "interesting and important feeling" in this context, Kosatchev called "the demand for the Russian vision of how the modern world should develop".
"I attended many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the session of the General Assembly] of the Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergei Lavrov, I held my own meetings, and I was very pleased to see that if a year or five years ago, the situation was more or less, the Russian opinion was more or less.
In his view, this is due to the fact that "in the so-called new liberal order, which is embodied with the West, there are no answers to the questions of how to solve the world's problems because of the obvious deficiency of ideas in the global space".
"And here the demand for the Russian vision is becoming more and more obvious," Kosachev expressed confidence, stressing that he considers in this sense "the current session successful for the work of the Russian delegation, successful for Russia".

Damascus declares its right to use military force in Idlib
Damascus hopes that the Syrian province of Idlib will not have to use military force, said the head of the Syrian Arab Republic’s Foreign Ministry, Valid Muallem.
Syria, he said, has the right to do so.
The minister added that Turkey has the opportunity to quickly solve the problem of the withdrawal of militants banned in Russia of the organization Jebhat al-Nusra from the demilitarized zone in Idlib, reports RIA Novosti.
The head of the foreign ministry also stressed that Damascus would have to resort to a military solution to the problem of territories east of the Euphrates in case the Kurds aspire to separatism.
At the same time, according to Muallem, the negotiations with the Kurdish SDF forces were good until they were interrupted because of the United States.
On September 17, Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an agreed to establish by October 15 a demilitarized zone along the line of contact between the armed opposition and government troops in the Syrian province of Idlib.
Terry headed the Chelsea Youth Team.
Earlier it was reported that the 37-year-old defender had conducted negotiations on the transition to the Moscow "Spartak".
As RT reports with reference to Mirror, former England team captain John Terry led the youth team "Chelsea".
According to the source, the well-known player, who has been a member of the London club for a long time, will lead the team at least 23 years of age.

The first deputy spokeswoman of the Verkhovna Rada, Irina Gerashchenko, apologized to the convicted in the Russian Federation for the "spying" of Ukrainian journalist Roman Sushchenko for not having been released from the fences so far.
She said this in a video address to the political prisoner recorded on the eve of the second anniversary of the illegal arrest of Sushchenko FSB.
According to her, these days under the walls of the Russian embassy in Paris is taking place an action, the participants of which declared a hunger protest with a demand to release the prisoners of the Kremlin.
Every day, French journalists, politicians, cultural figures, and people who know you well, are starving, supporting Oleg Sentsov, other political prisoners of the Kremlin, and of course you.
There is no international meeting, no negotiations, no interviews in which the President of Ukraine, the Ukrainian authorities, all of us, did not demand to put pressure on the Kremlin, to put pressure on Putin with a single demand.
She also expressed confidence that the trials will enrage every Ukrainian, making us "more evil, harder in defending the national interests of Ukraine, in protecting every Ukrainian, in understanding what is good and what is evil".
Recall, Ukrinform correspondent in France Roman Sushchenko was detained by Russian forces on September 30, 2016 at Moscow airport.
On October 7, he was charged with spying on the Main Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine.
On June 4, 2018, the Moscow City Court sentenced Sushchenko to 12 years in a strict regime colony, and the Supreme Court of Russia recognized this verdict as legal.
Russian inmates met the last request of the Ukrainian before his graduation into the colony.

Wahtang Kikabidze on the fight against cancer
Now many artists are talking about how they managed to cope with oncology.
The disease, unfortunately, does not spare anyone, and the stories of popular people about victories over cancer, gives hope to many patients.
The famous actor Wahtang Kikabidze admitted that he was alive only because of his wife.
Many years ago, he was diagnosed with a terrible disease, which sounded like a sentence.
“I feel like I’ve been hit by a hammer down the skull.
I fell.
Lost orientation.
Put him in the hospital.
The spoon couldn't hold, couldn't stand, fell all the time.
The tests started, it turned out, bad things, the artery does not leak blood.
They brought me to Moscow, there they said that I had a large purulent cyst in my head, they urgently had surgery.
And during the operation, doctors for the cyst saw the tumor," - said Kikabidze in the program "One day".
The tumor turned out to be malignant.
Then, 37 years ago, the inhabitants of Tbilisi even came to say goodbye to the kumir on the threshold of his home.
But the actor's wife did not allow the actor to be buried alive, she believed sacredly that she would be able to cope with the disease and did not leave the bed of her beloved husband for more than a year.
If I hadn't been Irina, I wouldn't have been alive now.
Whenever I had critical situations, she was around like a rock,” the actor said.
The actor managed to cope with the disease, now he lives happily in his home in the center of Tbilisi.
And from time to time he denies rumors about his illness, about his untimely death, which also appears on the Net.
The creators of the site "Peace Worker" have contributed to the section "City" of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Hungary Peter Siyarto.
The reason was "an attempt on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine".
In addition, the head of the foreign ministry of the neighboring country was highlighted in "direct threats of invasion of Ukraine" and "support of separatist moods in Ukraine", as well as in the participation "in the organization of a provocation aimed at mass violation by citizens of Ukraine of the legislation of Ukraine".
It should be noted that before Siyarto in the "Chylistych", the deputy of the Kiev-Pecherska Lavra Pavel and the predecessor of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) Onufrii were welcomed.
The reason was their opposition to receiving Thomas from the Ukrainian local church.
Earlier, commenting on the issue of Hungarian passports to citizens of Ukraine in Transcarpathia, President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko demanded respect for the sovereign rights of Ukraine.
Authorities named the sum of the "golden parachute" of the Voronezh governor

Onishchenko is the first Vice-Chairman of the Education and Science Committee.
Based on his work experience, he noted in an interview that teenagers are provoked to masturbation by malicious information they find on the internet.
Fighting this should be at the level of educational institutions and family, the deputy added.
Gennady Onishchenko, deputy of the State Duma of the Russian Federation (in an interview with the radio station "Moscow Speaks":
As part of the general sexual education of children, this should be done, explaining the destruction, because there is a certain risk to the sexual health of the child, both the boy and the girl.
The problem is objective, it is that the maturation of children arrives early enough, and then there are large scissors between their sexual maturation and the opportunity to officially enter into intersex contacts.
According to Onishchenko, the solution of the problem is hindered by "handsmanship", the silence of "the problem of sexual age" and the lack of a culture of adequate education of children.
The doctor is sure that many teens are faced with masturbation.
The deputy believes that practicing lessons on the harm of masturbation is primarily in schools in "hyper-urbanized" regions.
“If we start this conversation in our Muslim Republic, we will simply not be understood by you, to put it mildly,” he said.

AdG became the second most popular in Germany
Anti-immigrant "Alternative for Germany" hits another popularity record, and Angela Merkel's ratings are falling.
It seems that Germany’s residents have started to get seriously tired of Angela Merkel’s immigration policy, which has made the country a leading target for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
The most obvious is the recent social questions, according to which the anti-immigrant party "Alternative for Germany" is becoming more and more popular, and the positions of the ruling bloc of Merkel and Zeehofer are weakening.
This week, AdG broke another record, rising to the second row in the ranking of popular sympathy.
Right-wing conservatives with 17 percent of popularity managed to bypass the Social Democrats, who had about 16 percent.
The gap of one percentage point can be attributed to a statistical error, but it cannot be ignored the fact that the AdG created in 2013 from a small group of Eurosceptics economists managed to become a serious political force.
Leadership in general continues to hold the governing bloc of HSS/HDS, which has about 30 per cent.
However, there is a tendency to lose points – even in April, Angela Merkel’s support was four percentage points higher.
The personal rating of the German Chancellor, who leads the German government for the fourth consecutive term, is also declining.
Today, 48 percent of Germans support Angela Merkel, which is 7 percent lower than last year.
In addition, the Social Democrats followed the Greens (15%), the Left (11%) and the Liberals (10%).
Evolution of "Alternatives"
The "Alternative for Germany" party was founded in September 2012 on the basis of the group "Alternative choice 2013", which was joined by the originators of the Christian Democratic Union.
The group initially opposed the governmental course, but at first it focused solely on economic issues, including the problems of the euro and cooperation within the EU.
At the same time, the group opposed Germany’s “sponsoring” of the EU’s weak economies, did not exclude the possibility of returning to the German mark and the complete exit of the country from the European Union.
Against the background of the deepening of the immigration crisis, the political platform of the AdG has expanded.
In 2013, the group formed a full-fledged party that took the niche of Euroskeptics and began to harshly criticize the government for the failure of immigration policy.
In the last parliamentary elections in 2017, the AdG managed to break into the Bundestag for the first time, receiving 94 seats (out of 709).
Two representatives of "Alternatives for Germany" were given seats in the European Parliament.
Video published with a journalist, calling the citizens of Ukraine "the nation of the Bolsheviks"
Leading a political streaming show on Ukrainian TV, author of two books Ostap Drozdov admitted live that he considers his compatriots "a nation of Bolsheviks".
They believe in television and read little.
As Drozdov noted, it is difficult to live and work in such a country.
"We have not been vaccinated from childhood with a culture of reading and accepting texts," the journalist said.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drozdov’s words, accusing him of lack of patriotism and greed.
As reported earlier, the State Committee on Television and Radio Independence began to fight literature, which has the slightest hints of criticism from the Kiev authorities, banning the importation of up to 201 editions.

Canadians build a car in the event of an apocalypse - The Journal of Driving
You can buy this car from anyone.
Roshel Defence Solutions said it is already accepting applications for its new armored vehicle.
Bronevik apocalypse Roshel Senator APC
On the topic of the apocalypse, money is made not only by video game producers, film studios and book publishers.
Now a new niche is being developed by automotive companies.
So, Canadian Roshel Defence Solutions has unveiled its apocalypse armor Senator APC.
In the free-of-fantasy time, the company’s engineers create armored cars for the police.
The Roshel Senator APC is designed for 12 passengers, who are not particularly comfortable, but are fully secured in a full-water armored capsule.
This bunker, otherwise you won’t name the design, as the level of its booking is in accordance with the B7 standard, is installed on the chassis of a powerful Ford Super Duty truck.
Its bottom, also armored, is capable of protecting the capsule from damage by grenades and anti-personnel mines.
Salon of the apocalypse Rosel Senator APC
In order not to harm even the explosive wave from the broken-up near the car bomb, the car’s salon is equipped with special dampening chairs.
In addition, the capsule has an autonomous ventilation and fire extinguisher system.
For safe inspection, the Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a night vision camera system, as well as a blinded tower on the roof.
There are no weapons in the car.
Front of the apocalypse armored salon Rosshel Senator APC
To ensure that the weight of the armored car does not affect its mobility, the Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a 330-speed durable turbodiesel engine with a volume of 6.7 liters, all of which power is transmitted to the four wheels of the armored vehicle through a 6-speed automatic transmission.
Opportunities to get stuck entirely in the apocalypse Rosshel Senator APC
The Rosshel Senator APC will be seen at a specialised exhibition in Washington, D.C. in October.
The Time of Death of the Universe
The universe still exists about 140 billion years, ten times the age of the observed world, equal to about 13.8 billion years.
The study of the international team of scientists was published in the library of electronic preprints arXiv.org and is intended for publication in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, reports the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
Experts came to the same conclusion by looking at the Subaru Telescope’s HSC (Hyper Suprime-Cam) for about ten million galaxies.
By tracking the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which accounts for more than 95 percent of the energy-mass of the observed world, scientists working under the standard cosmological model of the Cold Dark Matter (LCDM), estimated the universe’s expansion rate to be slightly slower than previously thought.
The Subaru Observatory's press release notes that the observations allowed for a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the Universe, and the record of the European Space Telescope Planck clarified the limitations imposed on the LCDM parameters.
In July, scientists modeled the possible death of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues presented new arguments in favour of the fact that the observed world will cease to exist in 22 billion years as a result of the Great Breakdown.
Another attempt to unite the initiators of the retirement referendum has failed
Opportunity to know the opinion of the people on pension reform is postponed for an indefinite period
On Saturday, a meeting of the All-Federal Initiative Group for a referendum against the increase in the retirement age was held in Moscow.
It was attended by the representatives of 13 sub-groups, which registered different formulations of issues (all five formulations were registered by the Centre).
They decided to contact the CIC with a request for registration of a single initiative group and to ask the Russians: "Are you in favour of the provision of pension legislation as of July 1, 2018, the age of which the citizens of Russia are entitled to a song of old age?"
This wording was registered by the Vologda subgroup, whose representatives did not participate in the assembly, but considered it to be the simplest and legal container.
The majority of the members of the assembly were the supporters of the member of "Just Russia" Ilya Sviridova (six subgroups) and the KPRF (four subgroups).
They were joined by three independent subgroups - from Nizhny Novgorod, Voronezh and Orenburg.
Earlier, Sviridov told the Vedomosts that invitations were sent to all initiators, and the consent to come was expressed by representatives of about 40 subgroups.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, head of the Vologda subgroup (there were 15 other subgroups supporting its formulation), told Vedomostya that she did not receive invitations and did not plan to come: “We did not know who was the friend, but who was the enemy.”

Zinetula Bilyaletsdinov: "Admiral" created us big problems
The head coach of "Ak Barsa" Zinetula Bilyaletdinov summed up the results of the regular KHL championship match against "Admiral" (4:2).
“The game was difficult, difficult.
The rivals fought well and created great problems for us.
I’m glad we played well today in the majority.
I've already said that someday the naked ones will come, the main thing is that we're working on this.
And what we won is also very important.”
“Why did you decide to give Danish Zaripo a breath of fresh air in this series?”
“We have our own program that we are working on.
That is why there was such a decision," - says Bilyaletdin's press service of the club.

In the match "Loko" - "Akhmat" Turbine mistakes erupted like from the horn of abundance
Former all-Union judge Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of the referee Eugene Turbine in the match of the 9th round of the Russian championship "Lokomotiv" - "Akhmat" and solved the controversial episodes of the game.
- How do you assess the participation of Evgeny Turbin in the match "Lokomotiv" - "Akhmat"?
“I believe that this referee has confirmed his inadequacy for the Russian Premier League matches.
I am surprised that the efforts in the meeting of the fifth round "Spartak" - "Dynamo", neither Turbine himself nor the leaders of the DSI made serious conclusions about his low qualifications.
The result did not slow down in the ninth round: mistakes in his actions, private omissions of rough receptions erupted like from the horn of abundance.
For example, in the 50th minute of the Eder railroad, with the help of his hands, the defender of "Ahmat" Rodolfo falls in his penalty area.
Eight yards from the gate, but Turbine doesn't put penalties.
- How do you rate the episode with Idov, who was in the 82nd minute when it appeared that the ball was in his hand?
- I think there was a deliberate play by the defender's hand in his penalty area.
Turbine was next to the moment, well sees this episode and its first assistant to the right.
This moment was also to be seen by the reserve judge Sergei Karasev.
However, all three fell asleep, and the penalties were not appointed.
Therefore, the account in the match is distorted, and sporting justice turned out to be poor.
This was the same case where the jury of concepts extorted and buried the sporting spirit of the game.
In the 52nd minute, Turbine did not decide to remove guest defender Oleg Ivanov, who violated the rules in the fight against Krykhovyak, and when the judge showed him the yellow card, he demonstrated his applause.
What do you think of this episode?
Did you have to show the second "peanut"?
- At this point, Turbine and the first yellow card showed not quite the case.
The second would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match about the double standards of the court that some teams are being penalized for such violations as in the episode with Idov, and some are not.
What do you think of the footballer’s words?
- Seeing what to understand by double standards.
It was a penalty.
He didn't.
So the referee does not give a second penalty to the opposite gate.
This is the principle that is used.
And the second point of the double standards is that the judge watches who plays.
He played Lokomotiv on Saturday and Ahmata has serious claims for Turbine's work because the team was damaged.
Matt Damon played the accused in the rape by Judge Kavanaugh at the start of the SNL
American actor Matt Damon played the U.S. Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavano, who is accused of rape.
Damon appeared in the first edition of the new season of Saturday Night Live on NBC.
During a small sketch, the actor played Kavanaugh at hearings in the Senate on a rape charge.
The U.S. Supreme Court candidate has previously attracted attention for his emotionality and detailing his stories during an interview with Senator Amy Clobushar.
So, Kavanaugh confessed repeatedly to his love of beer, but stated that he had never been drunk until memory loss.
In addition, in an attempt to justify himself on a rape charge, Kavano claimed that he was a virgin in those years.
These moments were also played by Damon.
I just did a lot of drinking and didn't think about sex at all.
I was the proudest, most drunk virgin I've ever seen.
“Everyone knows it,” said the judge, Matt Damon.
Kavanaugh was previously elected U.S. Supreme Court judge.
Barbra Streisand has discovered strange behavior in her cloned dogs
American singer Barbra Streisand said the clones of her deceased dog behaved completely differently than the original pet.
"They're not like them.
In fact, [the clones] look like it, but it is impossible to clon the soul,” the 76-year-old singer stressed.
At the end of 2017, Streisand ordered two clones of her 14-year-old dog, a coton-de-tulear named Samantha, who had to fall asleep due to health problems.
In July 2018, it was reported that a Chihuahua dog named Miracle Milly, which was named the world’s smallest dog, was cloned for the 49th time.
Experts are cloning a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so miniature.
U.S. thinks about Russia’s maritime blockade due to oil and gas supplies
In the U.S., Russia can start a sea blockade to gain an advantage on the world energy market.
The U.S. authorities have taken so seriously in the fight for success in the global hydrocarbon market that they are ready to resort to the sea blockade of Russia, which remains one of the world’s leading energy suppliers.
The possibility of a sea blockade was reported by the head of the U.S. Interior Ministry Ryan Zinke.
Contrary to global practice, the U.S. Department of the Interior does not perform police, but civilian functions, including implementing policies in the field of natural resources.
Therefore, Zinke's statement was entirely within the competence of the department headed by him, although it was not deprived of political color.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinke said that thanks to the naval forces, the U.S. controls sea routes in the Middle East region and can block them if necessary.
Zinke said the need could be linked to Washington’s desire to hamper Russian supplies to the global energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia still receives a lion’s share of its revenue from supplies to the world’s oil and gas market.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East as well as in Eastern Europe was the main motive for Moscow’s revitalization in the region, Zinke said.
He made it clear that the U.S. still expects to ensure leadership in the global energy market, becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
To do this, Washington will have to stifle Russia and Iran, and the maritime blockade of trade routes is an acceptable measure on this path, Zinke said.

There’s a club in Russia that I’m following.
Former Chelsea captain and England team John Terry - about why he visited the match of the ninth round of the Russian championship "Spartak" - "Rostov" (0:1).
“In Russia, I have a club that I am following.
I’ve been watching it quite recently and it was interesting to look at it from the side.
“I can’t say I’m a fan, because my heart belongs to Chelsea, but I have the sympathy for Spartacus and I want to apologize again for the decision,” said Terry.
Remember, "Rostov" with 18 points rose to third place in the tournament table, and "Spartak" placed in the fifth row, having 15 points in the asset.
In the next round, on October 7, the red-and-white players will play with Ennisei, and the subordinates of Valeria Karpin will receive Orenburg earlier in the day.
Dear violin put in lombard for priceless
When in Somerville, Massachusetts, the LBC Boutique and Loan lombard brought the violin, the lombard worker offered only <0x24>50 for an old and unrepresentable instrument.
But the experienced store manager, Dylan McDermitt, suspected it was an old and expensive tool, and asked the expert for advice.
It turned out that the violin was made in 1759 by the famous Italian violinist Ferdinand Galiano and is estimated at <0x24>250,000.
Only arrows to the violin are valued at <0x24>16-18,000.
The investigation found that the violin was recently kidnapped from one of the city’s residents, and the instrument was returned to the legitimate owner.
It is not yet known how the violin got to the man who gave it to the lombard, but there are no previous clashes with the law behind it.
The manager says that now everyone who brings the violin to the lombard will be asked to play it to make sure it really belongs to the client.
In the ninth round, the RPL will have an exciting confrontation: "Spartak" will receive at its stadium in Tushin "Rostov" under the leadership of Valery Karpin - a person, as you know, not at all foreign "people's team".
The special spicyness of this meeting is given by the fact that the clubs now have the same number of points - 15, and they share 3 and 4 places in the tournament table, departing from the far-flung "Zenit" and being at one point from "Krasnodar", which will play tomorrow.
The red and whites now have a difficult track: the club is once again surrounded by idiotic scandals, in the Europa League the team of Massimo Carrera suddenly flew to Rapido, and recently surrendered to Ahmata.
After a derby with the CSKA, which ended with a fair niche, "Spartak" with a minimum account and not without difficulty played in the Cup "Black Moroccan", and so far it is too early to talk about whether the most popular club in Russia was approaching to get out of the crisis.
"Rostov" could not win three matches in a row, but the defeats do not know five matches already.
Let’s see if Carpin will be able to extend the winning series with such a principled match.
The previous meeting of the Carp "Rostov" with "Spartak" ended in favor of the capital team.
Start at 19:00.

The threat is growing, Iran and North Korea are becoming more dangerous, the enemies are operating in grey zones using cyberattacks and fake news, the minister added.

The referendum is called to resolve a 27-year dispute with neighboring Greece over the name of the country, which coincides with the name of the neighboring Greek province.

Translator compared the mentality of Russians and Germans
The mentality of the Russian and German peoples is different, but the few differences between them do not play a large role for mutual understanding.
This was reported on International Translator’s Day, September 30, by professional translator-synchronist Barbell Sax.
She has been translating from Russian and English for more than 30 years.
"Germans like to plan events calmly, and Russians, as the saying goes, "for a long time, to go quickly."
But I don’t think it plays a significant role in understanding between peoples and in the work of the translator,” the specialist said in the commentary of RIA Novosti.
According to the translator, to understand that two countries can’t do without each other, “it’s enough to know history.”
And in the future, Saxony noted, there is no point in Germany ignoring Russia.
Russia is a natural part of Europe, there is no point in trying to ignore it.
We need Russian gas, oil, there are many things that define our common destiny,” she said.
A day earlier, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that the country is trying to "bind" relations with Russia and support them.
According to her, for Berlin mania is particularly important the project of the North Stream 2 gas pipeline, which is being built from the coast of Russia to Germany at the bottom of the Baltic Sea.

Valery Belov: God helped Siberia today
The head coach "Vitazya" Valery Belov - about the defeat of "Siberia" (3:4) in the game of the regular KHL championship.
"The colleague spoke about the fans of Siberia, and I want to mark our fans," - says Belova's official website "Vitazya".
"I hope they will also support it, because now almost every game is a full stadium, an excellent atmosphere.
After the game, it is likely that God helped the Siberians today because they were very wrong, especially our leaders.
Overall, our leading leaders have lost a micro-match of 0:3, so it was hard for us to draw this match, even though there were moments.
Still, I will take the blame on myself.
'Cause we seem to have missed something in preparation.
Compared to the previous game, it was a different team.”
"It's a formless commotion."
Viewers are outraged by Agutin's choice for the "Voice" show
The audience of the show "Voice 60<0x2B>" accuses the mentor Leonid Agutin of "unformed commotion and naive subtlety".
When, in blind hearings, he first learned the voice of his father, Nikolai Agutin, many hoped that he would maintain neutrality and not return to the performer.
But his son's feelings took over, and he chose a relative in his team.
Then many considered it a joke, but pardoned the tutor’s unobjectiveness in the first stage.
But the "joke" was delayed, and the star's father completely unjustifiedly took the place of more dignified performers.
And now spectators are no longer ready to forgive Agustin for such injustice.
Yesterday, we, the viewers of the show, were outraged by the commotion and frankly pushing our close relatives to the final ladder.
I had even doubted that Agutin would have enough strength and conscience not to throw his dad to the top of the list at all,” Irina Petrovskaya and Ksenia Larina argued in the program “The Man from TV”.
Meanwhile, for the sake of his father, Leonid Agutin "mixed" beautiful performers who actually sang, while Nikolai Petrovich whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining this by what the audience still want to see in his father's show.
But as it turned out, this is not the case at all, viewers want an objective assessment and see in the final really talented performers, and now Agustin has discredited the show.
“I feel sorry for the members of the Voz from the Agutina team – they were condemned.”
“Last time Agustin showed how much he loved his dad, and today he had to show himself a professional.”
"The competition has lost its meaning."
"To remove two talented people from the project and leave in the project your dad who is not singing but whispering, how can you then name a mentor?",
“Like a pop singer, arrange a concert in the Kremlin for your money and see how many people will come to this concert.”
It's a voice show, not a cool relatives show.
“It was unprofessional on Agustin’s side.”
"Then you have to offer your own show to the dad, not the show that's made for the money of 1 Channel."
“It was a real opportunity for someone, and he took someone’s place.
And I don't understand why the voiceless dad should inspire me more understanding than any other participant with real vocal data.
Why did the worker from Surgut, with a magnificent voice and timbre, melt and lead Agustin to the final?
And then we all complain that the same people on stage and on screens for decades!
Because they don’t break through the cowardice!”
"What were you waiting for?
This is Russia!
Round of mud and buffalo.
The money in the family budget will not be superfluous.
The theater of absurdity continues!”
Users also recalled that in one of the seasons of the traditional "Voice" on blind hearings came the son of Gradsky.
At that time, the metro and the head did not come to take the son to his own team.
Plus, he said, "Come on, get out of here, it's all right."
Agustin could not act as a professional.

Scientist told about possible scientific program of Russian expedition to the moon
The head of the Institute of Space Studies of the Russian Space Agency, member of the correspondent of the Russian Space Agency Anatoly Petrokovich told RIA Novosti about a possible scientific research program for Russian astronauts on the moon.
According to him, the scientific community is currently developing the directions of such works.
“There is no consolidated opinion yet,” the scientist said.
He noted that one option is to place a low-frequency radio telescope on the reverse side of the moon, which would avoid the interference of which the Earth is the source.
"This is the only place where such a telescope can be deployed to study the cosmic sources of radiation," Petrokovich added.
He also believes that the Moon could be used to conduct robotics testing, to use local resources for construction.
In addition, astronauts should be attracted to the search for primitive organs on the Earth's satellite, the scientist believes.
This could help determine how life appears on the planets.
Earlier, the head of the corporation “Roscosmos” said that in the optimistic version of the Russian Federation can make a piloted flight to the moon by 2030.

Sergei Sirotkin: I couldn't do anything, and it was very painful
Russian pilot "Williams" Sergey Sirotkin commented on the outcome of the Grand Prix race of Russia.
“Honestly, I don’t want to talk about what’s in my head.
I had a good start, and in the second lap, I was between two cars that immediately made me sad.
I lost all the positions I played at the start, the moment, right away.
He was in a very bad position.
He's stuck in traffic.
We hoped that after the rest of us get to the pit-stop, we would get into the "clean air" and the pace would return, but the rubber was no longer there.
He also struggled with his partner, and he also had contact with him.
I understand he's a little mistaken.
We were in such a situation on the most impeccable track of the season, I couldn’t do anything, and it was very painful, to be honest.
I don’t want to talk about it anymore,” says Sirotkin RIA “News”.
Recall that Sirotkin in the race at the Russian Grand Prix finished 18th, the winner was British pilot "Mercedes" Lewis Hamilton.
Tarpischev called the removal of Glushakov and Yeshenko from the foundation of "Spartak" absurd
President of the Federation of Tennis of Russia (FTR) Shamil Tarpischev commented on the removal of the Moscow "Spartak" footballers Denis Glushakov and Andrei Yshenko from training with the main composition.
Carrera’s actions were absolutely absurd.
To pay attention to such things is a nonsense.
I don’t agree with what Carrera does.
It only deepens the team's disruption.
First, these are poems, you can read and perceive them as you like.
I wouldn't have reacted to this in Carrera's place.
Everyone has their own opinion.
Secondly, everyone wants to be buried.
If Glushakov and Eschenko put likes, that doesn’t mean they have something against the coach.
I think the Italian lacks the flexibility of perception of the situation.
This is not a normal climate in the team.
Today, Spartacus does not have a game, so this situation did not need to be inflated at all.
Maybe we should have laughed at this together.
"Spartacus" has a lot of not in order in different lines, there is no play after the introduction of the youth.
Relationships within the team, apparently, do not add optimism before this match," - Tarpischev is sure.
The match between the two teams will take place on September 30 and will begin at 19.00 Moscow time.
Previously renounced Spartacus, John Terry headed the Chelsea youth team.
Sirius pupils discussed with scientists about natural-like technologies
The students of the educational center "Sirius" in Sochi, participants of the School of Agrobiology and Plant Genetics, attended the lecture of the scientists of the national research center "Kurchatovsky Institute".
The presentation of the researchers took place within the framework of the program of the Global International Convergent and Environmental Technologies Forum, organized in Sochi on the orders of Russian President Vladimir Putin, reported on the website of the educational center on September 29.
The lecture was opened by the documentary "Codes of Kurchatov", during which the president of the Kurchat Institute, member of the RAN correspondent Mikhail Kovalchuk spoke about the global challenges as the driving force for the development of civilization.
The lecture of the scientist was published on the site of Sirius.
Students have learned that modern technologies need a huge amount of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet able to produce such volumes.
To solve this problem, according to the organizers of the forum, will be helped by nature-like technologies, on which young scientists are working today.
In addition, Kovalchuk raised the topic of responsibility for the development of environmentally friendly technologies, and also spoke about the risks that inevitably arise when creating such technologies.
“The advent of such technologies is a unique thing, it’s a colossal good.
It is the explosive growth of medical technologies, it is the improvement of quality of life and infrastructure.
But there's the other side.
The development of nature-like technologies is in fact the technological reproduction of systems of living nature.
There is a reverse side - a targeted interference in a person's life.
There are always risks.
There was a car – people started to die under the wheels.
The cars are still used.
Dual nature of technology at once.
I am creating new medical technology, and at the same time I can create weapons of mass destruction," - quotes scientist REN TV.
After watching the film and discussing modern scientific breakthroughs, students were able to ask questions to the participants of the meeting.
In the role of speakers were the candidate of physico-mathematical sciences, the head of the Kurchat complex of NBICS-like technologies of NIC "Kurchatovsky Institute" Yulia Diakov and the head of the Kurchat complex of NBIKS-technology.
The Sirius Education Center in Sochi was created by the Educational Foundation Talent and Success based on the Olympic Infrastructure at the initiative of the President of Russia Vladimir Putin.

Macedonia: Referendum not held due to low turnout
The referendum was called to endorse the agreement of the authorities in Athens and Skopje to rename the Balkan country to "North Macedonia".

Kemerowchan upsets sheep flock at cemetery
On September 30, a message from an eyewitness appeared on the famous page of Kemerovo on the social network that horned animals were walking freely through one of the local cemeteries.
The animals of the small flock crossed between the fences and cut off the grass.
The commentators expressed different opinions: some of the locals noted that in the presence of the cemetery of small horned cattle there is no harm, and their appetite can even help in the clearing of the vegetation of the vegetation of the vegetation and grass grass: but some of the vegetation is eaten by the vegetation.
"It's a graveyard, not a graveyard.
There's nothing the sheep can do.
Of course, you won’t say that they bite, but that’s not the case.” (style preserved) – said an angry kemerovchanka in her message.
Either way, one of the eyewitnesses noted that the problem in the form of animals in the middle of the cemetery is already known, and the necessary measures will be taken soon.
Pull and bring – how right?
Words do not exist.
It's the right thing to do.
The word "press" in the meaning of "to harden, to influence, to influence" exists only phonetically, because we hear a sound [a] instead of [o] in the word "to bring."
We use this word, believing that it comes from the word "pressure."
But the "pressure" and "achieving" are not only etymologically close, but even in some sense opposite.
Make sure you do it yourself.
Dovlet (church-book, obsolete) means "sufficient, complete, sufficient, to be sufficient for anyone or anything, to satisfy."
Satisfaction, pleasure - related words.
In the past, he had the meaning of "to depend on nothing, to have self-satisfactory meaning" - "to achieve oneself."
Staroslavian "dovl<0xC5><0xA3>ti" related to the words "wait" and "will".
Pressing, suppressing are completely different.
These words have truly frightening "family": daos - "wolf" (sweeping sheep), deyja - "to die" and dvaid<0xC4><0xAB> - "to trouble".
The similar phonetic shape of the words "pressure" and "commit", as well as the inevitable aging of the latter, forced them to enter into contamination.
Thus, we have the very "d[a]white", which is also used in the letter through "a", which is better, incorrect and impossible from the point of view of the processes of the emergence and development of these words.
So, it's right to get it.
But this word is outdated, in its proper sense no longer used.
If you want to note that any circumstances/people have a negative impact on you from above, use the word “press”.
You can also use the design "to measure the pressure", but remember that it is the office.

“I think there are a lot of people in the world who are capable of doing this.”
“Unfortunately, they don’t attract the same attention as the outings of the bastards.”

The readers asked the journalist if she could suddenly find out who was the author of the idea and tell her about it.
After all, this man seems to be somewhere nearby: he has watched the child park several times, once this happened to his mind.

With the help of an operation in Syria, Russia guarded itself against terrorists
In the three years of the Russian military operation in Syria, about 100,000 terrorists were killed, of which 85,000 were destroyed by the Russian Air and Space Forces.
This was said in connection with the third anniversary of the beginning of the Russian military operation in Syria by the former head of the VCS, the head of the Committee of the Federation Council on Defence and Security, Viktor Bondarev.
He noted the high precision of the use of means of air damage: the air and space forces have applied and continue to apply all strikes precisely on the objects of the terrorists.
According to Bondarev, tens of thousands of terrorist objects have been destroyed in Syria in the last three years – for example, ammunition warehouses, fortifications and headquarters.
With the help of Russian airstrikes, the defense of the jihadists was hacked - it became a decisive contribution to the advancement of government forces in Syria, reports Interfax.
At the same time, according to Bondarev, the operation of our military in Syria allowed Russia itself to be fenced off from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the beginning of the operation in Syria, more than two-thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including the Islamic State (ISIS, banned in Russia) and the Jebhat-an-Nusra (prohibited in Russia).
According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, on the side of the ISIS were about four thousand fighters from the number of Russian citizens and about five thousand citizens of post-Soviet countries, TASS reports.
And it is only about the identified persons, except those who have not been identified, Bondarev stressed.
Most of them were trained and ready to take arms at any time, and Russian passports gave them the right to enter the territory of our country freely.
Thus, Bondarev noted, in Syria, Russia is fighting international terrorism at distant borders - otherwise this evil "would sneeze at us".

Syria accuses U.S. of supporting terrorism
Syrian Foreign Minister Valid Muallem has accused the United States and its partners of war crimes in Syria and of supporting terrorism.
The [Western] coalition completely destroyed the Syrian city of Raqqa, destroyed the infrastructure and public services in the areas against which its actions were directed, and committed mass killings of civilians, including children and women.
“These murders under international law are war crimes,” he said.
According to Muallem, the U.S. and its partners provided “direct support to terrorists” as the targets of the militants and the Western coalition in Syria coincided and meant “the seeding of chaos, death and destruction on their way.”
The head of the foreign ministry also noted that the fight against terrorists in Syria is almost complete, and the country has become safer and more stable.
Muallem added that Damascus also intends to clear Syria from illegal foreign presence, and priority in the restoration of the country will be given to Syrian partners.
In September, the head of the Russian Center for Reconciliation of Enemy Parties in the Republic, Lieutenant-General Vladimir Savchenko, said that two American F-15 aircraft had struck the Syrian province of Deir ez-Zor by banned phosphorus ammunition.
The United States rejected all accusations.
The President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko believes that respecting the sovereignty of other states, Ukraine has the right to demand the same respect for its own sovereignty.
The head of state said this during a trip to Kharkiv region, commenting on the issuance of his passports by Hungary in Transcarpathia.
By protecting Ukrainian citizens, I defend the sovereignty of our state.
Just as we respect the sovereignty of other states, we demand the same respect for Ukraine,” Poroshenko said.
According to Poroshenko, as president, he will protect Ukrainian citizens wherever they are - in the east or in the west of the country.
At the same time, the head of state supported the position of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the passport scandal with Hungary, which consists of the intention to send the consul of the country from the coast.
“I completely share every letter that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has said,” the President said.
According to FACTS, on September 19, a video appeared on the network, which recorded the moment of issuance of Ukrainian citizens at the Hungarian Consulate in the coast of Hungarian passports.
They swore a solemn oath of allegiance to Hungary.
Foreign Minister of Ukraine Pavel Klimkin noted that the consul of Hungary, who appears in a video with the distribution of Hungarian passports to Ukrainians, must leave the territory of Ukraine either at the decision of Budapest itself, or will be expelled by Kiev.
It was also known that the Prosecutor’s Office of the Transcarpathian Region has initiated a criminal case on the issue of passports to Hungary.
The incident is classified under the article "State Treasure".

Putin had already visited Hakasia in January of this year.
Along with Tuva, this republic is one of the president’s favorite places to rest.
More than 10 million Syrians have become refugees since the beginning of the armed conflict that has been going on in Syria for seven years.
About five million people have fled to other countries, primarily neighboring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.
Now, according to Damascus, the war is nearing its end, and the country is ready for the voluntary return of refugees.

The government is continuing its restoration work in areas devastated by terrorists, bringing them back to normal life.
All the conditions for the voluntary return of Syrian refugees to a country they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions, which have made life-threatening and left their means of subsistence.
The Syrian authorities have also called on the world community to promote the return of refugees and to allocate funds for this.
Meanwhile, the US and EU countries refuse to provide aid to Syria, saying that a political solution to the conflict must first be found.
"Folkswagen" fully admitted its guilt in "dieselgete" in January 2017.

The Group’s losses are estimated at least at <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>25 billion.

Folkswagen is trying to compensate for losses and restore customer confidence.
Thus, the management of the group has recently changed again, and a large-scale restructuring and fundamental changes in the management system have been announced.
Moreover, Volkswagen promises to buy even new cars if German cities ban diesel on their streets: this is the right the authorities received in February of this year.

Metropolitan Ilarion compared Kiev’s decision to rename UPC with the actions of the fascists
The head of the Synodal Department of External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, Metropolitan Hilarion, compared the rename of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of the Fascists against the Jews.
"It is still the same that in fascist Germany, the Jews have a yellow star, it means marking the Church as an enemy organization, and that is for this purpose that this bill was created," - said the metropolitan on the air of the TV channel "Russia-24".
According to him, this move will have the most serious consequences right now, when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is in the acute stage.
Kiev thus hopes to gain full control of the UPC and “put it out of the law,” the priest believes.
"This is the Ukrainian church, and the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are the patriots of their country," he added.
It was previously known that the deputies of the Verkhovna Rada are working on the implementation of bills No. 4128 (on the change of subordination of religious communities), No. 4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and No. 5309 (on the change of name of religious organizations).
The latter assumes the rename of the UPC of the Moscow Patriarchate.
The Deputy of the Pochaev Laureate called for the protection of Orthodoxy and Ukrainian shrines
The Deputy of the Sveto-Uspenska Pochaev Laureate, Metropolitan Vladimir, called for the protection of the Orthodox faith and Ukrainian shrines.
The text of his appeal to the faithful of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) was published on Saturday on the website of the residence.
At different times in the history of our predecessors and relatives by faith and spirit, Christians had to confess their faith and defend their shrines.
Given the situation, and the information we have, and the threats of dissolution that is spreading, it is clear that we will have to survive something as well,” the Metropolitan said.
He asked for support – prayerful, moral.
The deputy laureate also stressed that "probably your physical presence will be needed."
The priest added: "Lenin's grandchildren are in the spirit, they are threatening to destroy, and therefore we will defend our sanctuary."
Whoever is not indifferent to the fate of the Pochaev Laureate - the Orthodox Ukrainian and world sanctuary, must be ready to protect it.
The Metropolitan urged not to go on behalf of those who mislead the believers.
The UPC has a canonical status as determined by Thomas on October 29, 1990 by the Mother of the Church.
And now someone wants to put into dependence on the novelist patriarch and friend of the Roman Catholic pope Bartolomeo.
A new style with its consequences is unacceptable to us Orthodox.
And we are satisfied with the status that our church has,” said the deputy laureate.
He recalled that the UPC has been canonically independent and fully independent in its administration since October 1990.
There is no administrative and financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchate.
In fact, Thomas already has our church.
What other Tomos do we need?” – metropolitan Vladimir Pochaevsky, calling on believers and all citizens to ask whether other religions have Tomos, are they independent of the Vatican?
Believers will be able to understand and decide what kind of temple they are going to go to.
However, someone wants to sow hostility and discord again.
Some are jealous that the domes are shining in the temples they want to destroy,” the priest stressed.
The Pochaev Lavra is the largest temple complex and monastery in Western Ukraine.
The laurel is located on the top of the Pochaev Mountain, 70 kilometers from Ternopol.
The first historical record of it dates back to the beginning of the 13th century.

Many fans reacted negatively to such a post and noted that, in fact, the singer "did not see the real life".
“You haven’t suffered yet.
You stick to every word, feed in a normal, ordinary family,” <0x40>nataliamamama37 wrote.
There were also those who advised Buzova to turn to psychologists or at least read books on the subject.
Is it worth reading the literature on psychology?
What do you need to do to prevent the victim from being corrupted?” wrote <0x40>liashukgalina.
However, there were also those who supported the singer.
"Ola, you, most importantly, don't get upset.
Your man will not speak loud words throughout the country and then just not perform them,” Buzova <0x40>arina_prostyle said.
"You're the queen and you need a king, and the one who changed you into papers, he just doesn't deserve you.
Up your nose and go on,” <0x40>Kreszentia_f wrote.
Earlier, Nazarov explained his decision to take 2 million rubles and give up Buzova by the fact that the singer lacks sympathy for him.
He decided to spend all his money on charity.

"The good game was interesting, although it went to the goal" - says Vorobyev's official website "Automobilist".
“I tried to play very simple.
I really liked the first period.
I didn’t use a few good moments.
In the second period, the opponent made us a little regret, we stood up.
But removing us a little bit "feeded".
The guys played great, they did a coaching setup.
I think if we continue to play correctly, the wins will come.
Not scored, with zero heads the game is not won, but the content of the game itself was correct.
Good luck will come if we continue to play in this direction.”
"In your opinion, did "Automobilist" add in comparison to meetings in Nizhny Novgorod?"
“There was no foreign team at the time.
In the pre-season, the teams solved other tasks, played a lot of young guys.
I think there was a completely different game, a different hockey.
"Car driver" is a good team.
According to the tournament table, the team is playing correctly.
Good hockey, good atmosphere both on the arena and in the city.
You can only wish them good luck.
The team is moving in the right direction.
There are a lot of good players, there are leaders.
Good defense, good goalkeeper.
It was hard, we were getting ready.
They knew the team was going without defeat, they wanted to break it, but it didn’t work.”

U.S. increases opioid production in Afghanistan
There was a lot of talk about the sharp exacerbation of the situation in Afghanistan on September 26 in Tehran.
There were multilateral consultations with the participation of Iran, India, China, Afghanistan and Russia, represented by Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev.
In fact, in the Afghan territory, the militants have unleashed a real terrorist war against the authorities and the civilian population of the country.
This year has become a record for the number of bloody terrorist attacks, which resulted in the deaths of thousands of ordinary Afghans,” Patrushev said.
The crisis in Afghanistan began not long ago.
After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the main enemy of the United States was the terrorist group Al-Qaeda (prohibited in Russia), which was planted in Afghanistan.
It has not been a month since the United States and NATO allies started a military operation called Indestructible Freedom.
It's been 17 years.
A multi-thousands of U.S. troops still in Afghanistan.
Peaceful life is even more spiritual than it was then.
The U.S. military is forced to close dozens of its bases.
They can be bought from fighters for money – just not touching them.
The Afghan government controls a smaller portion of the country's territory - 40%, according to Patrushev.
50% - in the movement "Taliban" (prohibited in the Russian Federation).
Another 10% - behind ISIS terrorists (prohibited in Russia).
But they grow up there fast.
The goal of creating a barbaric pseudo-caliphate in Central Asia is exactly what they did not do in Iraq and Syria.
America, it seems, is fine.
The fact that in 17 years of American presence, the production of drugs (opioids) in Afghanistan has increased at least 40 times.
The colossal growth of areas sown by opium mac and multi-billion-dollar profits.
Macedonians are preparing to vote in a referendum on accession to the EU and NATO on the condition that the name of the country is changed.
The agreement on the renaming of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia into the Republic of North Macedonia was reached on 17 June as a result of long negotiations with neighboring Greece, which refused to recognize the right of the Republic of Macedonia to be called Uzbekistan.
Lupko Petkovsky, a political scientist: “Through this agreement, Macedonia or North Macedonia gets the right to a better future, hope for social change.
And Greece will consolidate the right to its past.
There are no ideal agreements.
They arise as a result of difficult compromises that can’t please absolutely everyone.”
The rename of the country is supported by the ruling Social-Democrats led by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev.
Against - the conservative opposition and the country's president George Ivanov.
According to journalist Tsvetin Chilimanov, there is no point in Macedonia joining the EU - it is enough to have a partnership with him: "Many of those who do not like the agreement, believe that it is the country that the current socialist government, headed by Zaev, is tied to the subject.
However, this decision will have negative consequences.
First and foremost, the loss of sovereignty.
“Obviously there are countries that do not want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans.”
Faye Dulgari, Euronews: "The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is facing the biggest challenge in its history.
The country was on the brink.
The choice that the citizens of Macedonia will make will determine not only the future of the Balkans, but also of Europe as a whole.”
