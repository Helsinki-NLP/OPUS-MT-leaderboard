Parliament does not support the amendment that gives Timoshenko freedom
Today, the Parliament of Ukraine in the course of amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code rejected an attempt to repeal the article according to which the opposition leader, Yulia Tymoshenko, was convicted.
The amendment, which would have resulted in the release of the former Prime Minister in prison, was rejected during the second reading of the draft law on the mitigation of sentences for economic offences.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for signing a gas deal with Russia, which was considered unprofitable.
The sentence is not yet final; the court will consider Tymoshenko’s appeal in December.
Tymoshenko argues that the sentence is the political place of the regime; in the West, the process was also suspected of prejudice.
The proposal to repeal Article 365 of the Criminal Procedure Code, according to which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was supported by 147 Members of Parliament.
It would require 226 votes to be ratified.
Libya's victory
In the history of liberation, or rebellion, Libya has already lost.
Muammar Gaddafi was buried somewhere in the desert, without him, the war was over.
It’s time to determine the winners.
Islamists usually win in the country; the question is whether they are moderate or radical.
The transitional government has declared itself a follower of the conventional Sharia law, which we have already heard of.
Libya will become a crime-free country, as the penalty for theft is a hand cut.
Women may forget about emancipation; potential apostates will be executed; etc.
Instead of a dictator, a society made up of rival clans will be united by the Koran.
There will be an order in Libya that we cannot imagine, and that we would hardly wish for.
In any case, our way of life is neither the only one of its kind, nor the best and most likely would not be suitable, for example, for the Libyan population.
In fact, it is surprising that Islamic militants have received help from non-believers.
Their only justification is that, in their opinion, NATO attacks were led not by an American general, but by Allah, whose greatness they glorified after every strike.
And if we look for winners in Libya, the West is not among them.
We participated in the shootings, served Islam, and our politicians got rid of the dictator, their political ally, without any guarantee of profit.
Given the recent sad experiences with Afghanistan and Iraq, we have decided to give up the military occupation of Libya.
The local population, therefore, does not need to worry about the expulsion of the "cruisers".
But will oil companies receive Libya’s black gold almost inexpensive without the occupation?
Probably won't, and the West will finally be able to defend civil rights.
Unless the followers of Shariat put an end to it.
A New Wave of Crisis Begins
France and the rest of Europe are now at the centre of the attention of investors.
Statistical storms hit Europe on Tuesday.
Some countries have released data on GDP in the third quarter.
Compared to the previous quarter, the Czech economy was in stagnation, with Germany and France showing growth.
And yet today the debt market is breaking records.
Investors are not just looking at Italy; they are now focused on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
Statistical offices in the eurozone countries in Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries have released their preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by 0.5% expected; France - 0.4%.
Both countries also adjusted data for the second quarter, in which Germany went better than expected (increase of 0.3% instead of the initial 0.1%). France reported a slight decrease of 0.1% (original information implies stagnation).
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5%.
However, compared to the previous quarter, GDP was in stagnation. According to the Czech Bureau of Statistics, this confirmed the trend of a gradual slowdown in economic growth.
The results were worse than the analysts predicted.
Key Events:
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5%; however, it was in a steady state compared to the previous quarter.
Based on preliminary and seasonal data, Germany’s economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter.
From July to September, the economy of both the Eurozone and the European Union showed growth by 0.2% compared to the previous quarter, which corresponds to the forecasts of analysts.
Greece’s economy showed a preliminary decline of 5.2%.
The return on its 10-year bonds is 28.45%.
The return on both Italian and Spanish bonds is approaching a critical mark.
Even Austria, the Netherlands, France and Belgium, etc., are beginning to experience difficulties.
Although the situation in the region is deteriorating, the yield of Czech 1-year bonds remains around 4%.
In Germany, it is argued that the ECB is the last lender that can save the situation.
The Czech national team played in the Euros.
In Montenegro, they won with a 1:0 score and celebrate an unexpected cash prize of 200 million.
The national team has successfully coped with the most difficult task of the season!
Thanks to the magnificent Czech Republic and the beautiful goal of Peter Yirachek, they won with a score of 1:0.
In the second tie, the Czech team was fortunate to retain a significant advantage after the home rematch, and she will again participate in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz monitored the progress of the match and compiled a detailed report.
Almost nothing remarkable in the first time and great luck in the second.
The Czech national team, partly due to the defeat of the team at the end; the great Czech; and the heroic Yirachek; won 1-0 in Montenegro and celebrates the European Championship.
The excellent defense of the Czech team allowed the Montenegro team to create dangerous moments only in the second half of the game.
Damyanovich and Vucini<0xC4><0x87> became the most unsuccessful pair of matches after losing two great opportunities.
The magnificent Petr Czech is one of the reasons that the Czech national team will not miss the European Championship next year. And Czech football will thus earn about 200 million Czech kroner.
The game was very tense from the first moment.
Both teams had difficulty making combinations; the game spent most of the time in the center of the field.
This also explains the lack of pressure from the team of hosts in the first time. Long strikes behind the defense line were carefully intercepted by Czech defenders.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They created a living shield.
Several hundred students of the university have created a living shield around a nuclear power plant in Iran.
Thus, they want to express their support for their country's nuclear program in the face of a possible attack by Israel.
On Tuesday afternoon, students prayed before entering the building, followed by a prayer for the deaths of both the US and Israel.
In Isfahan, Iran, several hundred university students have created a living shield around the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant.
They thus demonstrated their willingness to protect their country’s nuclear program at the cost of their own lives.
In its latest report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) stated that everything is evidence that Iran has not abandoned its attempts to obtain nuclear weapons.
A possible attack on nuclear facilities in Iran has been discussed in Israel.
On Tuesday at noon for students’ prayers before entering the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant followed a plea for the deaths of both the US and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at maximum paralysis of Iran’s nuclear program, the targets would be to be installed in Isfahan and in Natanz, where uranium is being enriched.
Nutrition of obese children: No breakfast and snacks for dinner
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 weigh more than the norm; while 9% of schoolchildren are overweight, 5% suffer from obesity.
According to a recent study, children who suffer from obesity usually come from families who lead an unhealthy lifestyle.
We see again the importance of the environment and the patterns of behavior accompanying a person for his or her healthy development.
For example, sausages appear on the tables of obese children, almost twice as often as in families with children with normal weight.
More than 19% of obese children ate free potatoes for dinner on the eve of a survey related to an educational event called Obesity is not a coincidence.
Moreover, the families of children who suffer from obesity do not engage in sports. However, this applies to most of the families of modern schoolchildren - only 15% of children said that their parents find time to practice sports at least once a week.
The study was conducted on 900 children.
The study was conducted at the end of last academic year; it was attended by nearly 900 elementary school students throughout Bohemia.
Obesity is not a coincidence for the second year in a row, with the support of the insurance company Vseobecná sarodní ink<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xA1>tovna and the company Unilever.
To date, more than 12,000 schoolchildren of 4-8 grades have joined the project.
Proper nutrition and adequate exercise exercise are the main determining factors that cause the rapidly growing number of children who are either suffering from overweight or obesity.
“For example, only half of the respondents said they ate five meals a day, according to the breakfast-breakfast-breakfast-breakfast-breakfast-breakfast-dinner scheme, and that’s one of the essential conditions for proper nutrition,” the study concluded.
No lunches and snacks in the evening
Experts warn that for healthy development, even relative details such as the regular time of family breakfast are important.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of schoolchildren eat breakfast together.
In most families, breakfast is served separately.
The worst finding is that one in every 10 families don’t have breakfast at all.
And yet breakfast is the basis of the correct daily diet.
The study found that roasted food is more commonly consumed in families with children suffering from obesity.
Almost everyone – regardless of weight – drinks sweet cooling drinks every day (70%).
Although more than 40% of children regularly practice sports, this figure is more than doubled – up to 15% – when it comes to their parents.
Set up your own menu.
In another part of the study, the selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) were asked to prepare their own menu based on the suggested products and based on their tastes and preferences.
"Preferences in eating for Czech children aged 12-15 years are far from the ideal when it comes to healthy eating."
Their favorite food includes a large number of bitter, meaty and sweet dishes.
“Special concern is the great popularity of sweet cooling beverages,” the study concludes.
As the main lunch dish, pasta beat the bird with a small overweight.
However, the children had virtually no interest in beans, fish and vegetable dishes.
A desire for a healthy lifestyle
The study also found that children are willing to change their eating habits provided they are provided with relevant information.
“Many of the study’s control group participants demonstrated a significant shift in preferences towards healthy food when they filled out a questionnaire after completing the lecture Obesity is not a coincidence,” the project’s findings said.
This was especially noticeable, for example, in the case of sweet cooling drinks - more children began to prefer just water.
In addition, as the main dish, children were more often noted for birds and fish, limiting the amount of sweet dishes and baking.
A stylist should also be a good psychologist, say professionals
In the first article about training for stylists, I visited the volume of information at the introductory classes.
I had no idea what would happen next.
Lectures of three experts in this field; clothing choice tips for non-standard figures; and a workshop on how all this works in real life.
Further, more.
The closer we are to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks await us.
The training takes place every Saturday and Sunday, but it’s really full of information.
This time with Alenka, the director, (there is no man on the course) we discussed how to dress for a woman whose body is not perfectly symmetrical.
Most women are not completely symmetrical.
In one short neck, another boy's figure without proper shapes, another weighs more than the norm.
A stylist should know how to visually reduce the width of the shoulders, lengthen the neck, or add missing volumes.
We have been given advice on how to emphasize the figure of women like Jennifer Lopez, i.e. those who have a luxurious chest and ankle and a narrow waist, and at the same time do not dress them too challenging.
For example, if the difference in the size of the waist and thighs is so large that you cannot choose a skirt or pants, it is worth having at least one thing sewn to order.
You will obviously not regret the funds invested, as the perfect sitting clothes are invaluable.
In the skirt, sewn to order, you will feel much better than in the one that constantly leaves, spins, stripes the waist, etc.
The owners of the boy figures, on the other hand, can wear clothes with ribs, application, embroidery or folding.
Given the abundance of such information and types of figures, I’m glad that I have a whole week to realize all of this.
And yet, I’m afraid, it’s too much given the homework we’ve got.
Each participant of the courses had to invent two outfits for any celebrity: for the day and for the evening.
We need to take into account their modern appearance, their style in clothes and the type of figure.
I'm going to dress up Miranda Kerr, which you can know about Victoria's Secret advertising campaigns.
I’m happy about myself, because her dress is much easier than, say, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilar, who recently got a ton (please keep in mind that I’m exaggerating), or the very young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut clothes out of magazines or find them on the internet, print and process them with graphics programs.
The modboard - so called the result of the work - then reflects our own style and attitude to the graphic image.
It is important to keep in mind the graphic component style.
A stylist not only dresses real people, but creates product pages in magazines (based on special instructions, such as fashion bags, coats, etc.).
This is what the designer and designer Mario Kamenik told us about.
But it was only on Sunday.
A stylist needs common knowledge.
The Saturday lecture, saturated with information about the types of figures, was revived by three guests - specialists in the field.
Stylist, Honza Submissive; fashion designer, Jacob Polanka; and fashion photographer Ben Ranch.
Jacob reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should use this fact.
A good stylist knows how to use one item of clothing differently.
In this case, diversity is the key to success.
For example, a shirt can be worn in the usual way, on top of jeans and t-shirts like a coat; but it can also be worn on a naked body, without braces like a dress.
Another option is to roll the sleeve or lift the necklace, and the whole image changes completely.
"Play with him," he stressed.
Anyway, I highly appreciated the following advice: “For your work you should know the rules perfectly.”
Then you can start breaking them,” Jacob told us.
Here I finally realized why we confused all the definitions and rules, what to combine with what and why, while in fashion magazines we often see something completely different.
Not to mention the fashion shows.
From Ben, the photographer, I learned that the stylist must have more options of clothing than the number of photographs he needs to take.
So, for a fashion review of ten pages (equivalent to ten outfits) I must be ready to create at least fifteen images.
Now I also know that in the picture the item of clothing often looks and works in combination with others not quite the way it is in reality.
We have to keep this in mind when creating an image.
Honza Pokrona has confirmed that often image and style are half of success.
Just look at Madonna, who doesn’t have an amazing voice, but her image and marketing have turned her into a world star.
The attitude towards the services of stylists in the Czech Republic is still quite cool.
Even well-known people often consider it superfluous (and believe that it is enough to be a specialist in something, and how they look – secondary).
And if someone finally allows us to create their style, we have to expect them to call us a different (less) size than the one they actually wear.
We then turn to Google and find out if the tabloids have written anything about what some celebrity has been uplifting/slimming, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario emphasized that it is not enough for a stylist to understand fashion and be able to pick out a suit.
Our work consists mainly of communicating with the people we dress for; therefore it is important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to judge people, not to fool them and stick to their opinions.
“If the manager asks you to look at her clothes and add a few nice things, you can’t throw away her entire wardrobe by telling her that her clothes are terrible.”
“Find at least a few things you can praise, and advise what you can wear with them,” says Mario.
He also showed us that the workbag should be specifically fitted.
This is a bag that you tie around your waist to carry everything you need.
In addition to obvious things such as scissors, adhesive roller or English pens, it should be a nylon thread (stylists use it when shooting some items, for example, bags or hats), they are brackets, special clips for fastening fabric on the back of the case.
In order to distract from the lectures and get some practical experience, we have learned to do the right overlays on the sole shoe.
Even during shooting in the studio, where the floor is smooth, the soles can get damaged - not to mention shooting on the street.
And there we did the sticker.
You don’t have to touch the shoes with scissors so as not to spoil them.
It requires real skill.
I was glad that Mario praised my work.
The abilities mentioned have not come to my mind.
This is only part of what we heard during the second part of the weekend courses.
I’m starting to realize that being a professional stylist isn’t that easy, no matter what they say.
V Need for Speed: Escape takes place in America.
<0xE2><0x80><0xA2> Review
What was supposed to be a carefree walk turned into a routine morning trip to work because of a series of completely inappropriate and negligent mistakes.
The ambitions were satisfied to a certain extent, but it doesn’t matter, as no one clearly wanted to do the extra work.
Before the release of the new version with the subheading "Escape" was associated with great hopes.
It was expected to shift the previous Need For Speed series in a new direction; demo versions indicated that the game would occupy a decent place in the racing game genre.
We were curious to see parts of the game where the main character comes out of the car and runs.
As is often the case with NFS, in the end, a lot is different from what we expected.
The game is a pretty good arcade race, but the overall impression is lost by a few unnecessary mistakes that have been present in this series of games for several years.
And so, in fact, it is not a mistake, but a manifestation of an inexplicable lenin of developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You become part of the story, whose main character, Jack, decides to solve some personal problems by participating in an illegal race across America.
You’ll be in a car on the west coast in San Francisco, and your task is to get to New York first.
This idea has several interesting features.
The route consists of ten stages, divided into more than fifty races.
This means that each race takes place on its own route, individual stages take place in a diverse and interesting environment.
Therefore, there is no feeling that the same thing happens all the time in the game.
Despite the fact that the graph is at the same level as in previous parts of the series, it is nice to watch on some tracks.
However, the game does not create strong emotions.
Although driving through the desert, in the autumn suburbs or high in the snowy mountains is very pleasant.
In addition, the race from time to time revives an unusual detail.
For example, in the desert you get into a sandstorm, which significantly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains, you need to be careful not to fall under the avalanche.
The individual races are fairly well organized.
There are only a few varieties, but that is enough.
For a while you’re trying to bypass several opponents (essentially a regular race); then you’re trying to improve the time (a standard second-time race); or you’re competing with one opponent.
Among other things, from time to time you encounter the police, which further complicates your task.
The components outside the car are new.
It’s just an interactive animation where most of the time Jack runs away from someone and you have to help him by pressing the right buttons at the right time.
There's nothing complicated.
Although it’s surprising that these fragments are much smaller than you might expect (only three to be precise).
Actually, it turns out to be good for the game because it does not bode well; considering all of the above, it is one of the things that make the game more entertaining.
The race model follows the footsteps of previous models.
This means that it is no longer something special, but it cannot be considered a drawback.
If you are looking for imitation of real life, you will have to look elsewhere.
And yet this driving model is very suitable for dynamic races, although you can find better options on the market.
So far it's all very well.
After a while, however, problems begin.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not so good.
You don’t expect complex transformations and collisions from such a game, but if you have no idea before a collision with an object, how your machine will behave, something is wrong.
Typically, by rolling or passing machines in a dense stream, you sometimes touch another machine slightly. And yet sometimes in almost similar situations, your machine starts to swing furiously.
Or it's broken down.
This is not so important thanks to the restart system, but this is enough to spoil the fun.
The restarts are arranged so that if you break up or leave the track far away, the game will return you to the point where it was interrupted.
However, only five reboots are available for each race.
If you use them all, you will have to start the race from the very beginning.
This is useful in case something doesn’t work, but you can’t fully rely on it.
Sometimes restarts are not enough, and you have to learn a separate section of the race.
An important disadvantage of the game is the fact that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some turns need to pass in a certain way, otherwise you just won’t log in.
In other cases, you encounter civilian cars in a certain place in the same configuration, whether you arrive first, fifth, five seconds earlier, or a minute later.
This is especially annoying in situations when you see your opponent move easily between two cars moving in the opposite direction, while when you’re there, the cars are already positioned in such a way that you either need to go around them or lower the speed.
It doesn’t matter when you’re next to them; everything is arranged in such a way that the situation always happens right in front of your nose.
Competitors have other advantages.
During the game, you discover several places where, regardless of the time, the same opponent will wreak havoc on you in the same place.
This is especially evident at the end of the game, on the long bridge where you go in the opposite direction.
Obviously, your opponent has to stand in front of you no matter what.
The fact is, when he drives in front of you, he deteriorates you overview, which leads to one or more accidents in this area.
You can understand the attempt to make the game more interesting and filled with adrenaline, but it is so obvious that it quickly starts to cause irritation.
Unfortunately, despite the simple driving model, the game is fun and sometimes so full of events that you don’t have time to pay attention to what’s happening around you.
It doesn’t matter what makes you miss – a concept with fifty unique tracks, a sequence of races or something else.
The idea of changing cars during races is unusual.
You need to track the gasoline along the way, as it is on them that your car can change, despite the fact that in most cases the one you already have is enough.
Machines are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for cities; powerful American cars are for straight sections of the road; and exotic super-sports for technical driving, for example, on curved mountain tracks.
The main story mode is closely related to the challenge mode; it’s the individual track races that you’ll learn as the game progresses.
Here you win for your personal cause both medals and points, common to the challenges and story modes.
Many options are available to get a higher level of driving: from cars to profile data.
In addition, the profile is associated with the online Autolog feature, which, among other things, compares the results you achieve with the results of other players, and provides communication with the public.
Here’s another drawback that’s hard to understand; this is an example of the last race in a sequence.
You and your car get into the subway tunnel (let’s assume that’s the case), where you’re strolling along the rails in the dark (let’s assume that’s the case).
Your speedometer shows figures from 150 to 200 km/h (let’s say that) when suddenly a subway train crashes at your back, turning your car into a metallic chest.
For a few days, our editorial board discussed whether nobody really thought for a second at the time of creating the game, or whether its creators really thought of us as such.
The technical component of the game is nothing special; but the overall impression from the video is largely pleasant, sometimes even stunning.
Although it is a pity that at some critical moments the quality of the recording, sometimes quite strongly, is declining.
This is especially true for events with a large number of participants, where a good record would not help you either.
Sound in order; soundtrack - to the lover.
To please as wide a youth audience as possible, the soundtrack ‘compositions of different styles’ has come in; but it’s unlikely that many people will buy the game because of its music.
Need for Speed: Running is a bit of a mess.
If the game avoided clearly unnecessary mistakes, we could honestly say that Running is the best part of the NFS in the last few years.
In any case, the game leaves a feeling of incompleteness.
Of course, it’s a good entertainment, but be prepared for the shortcomings to blind you as an airport headlight.

Ambassador to the EU Vicenova:
The Czechs have a reputation for being unwelcome and skeptical of the euro.
"The Treaty of Lisbon has caused considerable discrepancies between individual organizations."
“I didn’t expect such a cruel war.”
“It will take five or six years before the situation at least somehow stabilizes, will calm down and all players will become accustomed to their new roles,” EU Ambassador Milena Vizenova began his lecture at the Faculty of Law.
She proved how much she adhered to her motto “Clearly and openly about Europe” in the first part of her lecture, where she described individual EU institutions and their relationships so simple and understandable that many lecturers from the Faculty of Law of the CU would be envious.
Moreover, Vitsenova commended the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy:
“At first, critics said he was an ordinary gray office mouse who couldn’t perform any role; I have to say, everyone was shocked at how well he handled his role.”
“He is a person who can listen to twenty-seven countries at the same time, communicate with them perfectly, and who has a clear idea of which side the EU needs to develop.”
She explained her new position of Representative for International Relations and Security in response to the question: "Who is the European Union? What number should I call?"; that is, as an important step towards unification and greater transparency of the Union's policy towards countries such as China or India.
No one is going to ban our cheeses.
Vicenova continued to focus on a program that is key for the EU in the past, present and near future.
She called the Czech Presidency a successful one last year.
The Czechs were dealing with the impending financial crisis; they overcame this crisis and organized the Eastern Partnership Summit.
She said that the resignation of the government at the time was a negative phenomenon that caused considerable harm to the Czech Republic.
Currently, Czech representatives in the EU are very busy.
As the Ambassador said, both the Presidency and the subsequent financial crisis have caused the ongoing horror.
In addition, it is necessary to adopt a new seven-year EU budget, which is very difficult given the current crisis.
Whether the budget will be scarce and cost-effective, which areas will be preferred; which countries will receive more support, and which countries will receive less; all these issues are in the forthcoming programme.
The Ambassador recalled the key slogans she brought to Brussels: "O Europe, a language understandable".
“I really don’t like shortcuts, foreign words and a jargon that no one understands.
How can citizens understand that in Brussels people are not trying to sell curves or round cucumbers, bananas of different sizes, or that someone is going to ban our cheeses?
It also intends to make more effective use of the EU environment and attract more Czechs to European organisations.
A multi-speed Europe is our future
The ambassador argues that the Czechs are regarded as Eurosceptics; as well as people who are noticing the negative rather than the positive sides of things.
She wants more representatives of the Czech Republic to be involved in European organizations.
She believes that several factors are responsible for this: for example, the modesty of our candidates and their inability to write motivational letters; at the same time with little support from the Czech side.
Along with the successful Czech Presidency, it noted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
“Believe me, when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary, and a Slovak joins us, the Frenchman next to me says, ‘Hey, why the assembly, the Visegrad Group again?’ and he’s not happy about it.”
In the future, the Vitsenova Union expects essentially new strict rules for the budgetary policies of the States Parties.
Compared with the new European Federation, it considers the idea of a two-speed, if not multi-speed Europe, more realistic.
“We have countries both inside and outside the Eurozone.”
“We have the Schengen area, and we already have an institution of enhanced cooperation.”
“For the first time, it has been said that countries that want to unite, while those who don’t want can stay away.”
“The number of such institutions will grow; it will be a truly two-speed Europe,” Vizenova expects.
In this regard, she stressed the role of both the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in promoting the rule that all EU-wide issues should be discussed by all participating countries, not only those that are part of the Eurozone.
History of the brand:
IBM is entering the second century of its existence.
If someone wants to find a word that best expresses the IMB strategy, the closest is likely to be “long-lasting”.
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution; the company is considered very modern, although it was founded more than a hundred years ago.
The company's longevity was set by its first boss, the dreamer Thomas J. Watson the Elder.
He believed in his motto that many world problems can be easily solved if people want to think.
His slogan "Think!" thus became the stamp around which the life of the future giant was developed (as well as the name of his internal magazine, which IMB began publishing in 1935).
What’s more, it was the foundation of the corporate culture that Watson carefully built.
“For us at IBM, long-term thinking means a constant move towards the future.
IBM has survived and thrived for a hundred years because it remained true to its original values, although it was not afraid to change everything around it.
In our first hundred years, this has enabled us to transform technology, business and company.
In the next 100 years, we hope to achieve even more,” said Samuel J. Palmizano, the company’s current CEO on the occasion of the anniversary.
Complex system
In the 1930s, Watson approached the issue of care for employees as well as Batya in the Czech Republic - IMB employees were among the first American employees with paid leave, employer insurance, an elegant outfit, and a complex bonus system.
Similarly, IBM’s long-term relationship with consumers has progressed.
From the very beginning, the company found a brilliant application for talented people. It was one of the first companies in the world to eliminate all discrimination, giving it a great choice.
It is in line with the anti-discrimination strategy and the current plan, according to which a woman, Virginia Romette, will replace Palmizano next year.
She has worked at IBM for thirty years; she is currently Director of Sales, Marketing and Development.
In the past few years, IBM has organised meetings, online brainstorming, during which many future innovations emerge.
Not surprisingly, there are a lot of ideas – about half a million people in the company.
An organization with a good reputation
A strong position of the company in the business is provided with a strong internal and external image.
“From the very beginning, from the point of view of the concept, IBM was rather an organization rather than a technology company,” said Harvard Business School professor and author of IBM’s book, Rosebeth Moss Canter.
“IBM is not a technology company, it’s a company that helps solve business problems using technology,” adds Joe Coloney of Forrester Research’s consulting firm.
As they say in the company itself, there is a difference between getting into the market and creating it.
For a hundred years, IBM, or the "Blue Giant", as it is called in the United States because of its logo, has become one of the largest companies in the world.
It seems to be the most versatile technology company - developing hardware and software; infrastructure; hosting and consulting services - from servers to nanotechnology.
It holds the largest number of patents among all American technology companies, with five of its employees receiving the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include, for example, an ATM, a bank card, a financial swap, a barcode, and a diskette.
With <0x24>220 billion, according to market capitalization, IBM became the second-largest technology company this year (the first at Apple), surpassing Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Look Forward <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Not all of its products came to the taste of buyers and fit into the era. For example, IBM failed with its OS/2 operating system; online service Prodigy and IBM PCjr computers.
“If your business is determined by moving forward, you can’t be emotionally tied to the past,” says Samuel J. Palmizano.
That’s why IBM easily lays the foundations on several platforms – if they don’t work, it gives up on them.
This is different, for example, from its competitor Microsoft, which is based and experiencing a fall on Windows, its operating system.
Perspective technology
IBM’s primary revenue comes from services, about one-fifth in each case comes from computer programs and hardware.
While in 1990, with capital twice as small, it was the strongest manufacturer of equipment.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-profit assets for <0x24>15 billion, while at the same time investing <0x24>58 billion in the purchase of promising technologies.
It continued to invest even after 2008, when the world was hit by the current economic crisis for the first time.
IBM follows the example of its first director, Thomas J. Watson, who increased the number of investments in the years of the Great Depression.
So far, IBM has not done any damage to the current crisis.
Since the beginning of 2008, the price of IBM shares has risen by a record 120 percent; the company’s net income has steadily increased.
IBM’s corporate motto is to change everything but its own values.
Therefore, it can be expected that even if another crisis breaks out, this flexible giant will cope with the situation.
The history of IBM: from a cheese knife to spaceflight.
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago. Its original name "Computer, Tabulation, Recording Corporation" was quite complex.
It took the name IBM in 1924. Originally it was called the brand, which was used for the company's offices in Canada and South America.
The foundations of IBM’s future were laid by the merger of four companies, whose history begins in the 1880s.
They owned technologies such as the legendary "table clocks", i.e. clocks that set the time when employees come and go from work.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlet Flint, who was also chairman of the company's board of trustees until 1930.
Flint hired a competitor's director, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
The CEO then turned the IBM founder in the shadow – Watson’s ideas remain the foundation of an unwavering corporate culture and individuality.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, started with the production and sale of various equipment for business – from cheese knives and meat cutters to cash registers.
In the first four years of Watson’s leadership, revenues doubled to <0x24>9 million, and the company began to expand to all continents.
Watson became so important to the company that nearly forty years later his place in the chair of the director took over his son, Thomas Watson the Younger.
Under his leadership, IBM began to develop artificial intelligence technologies and created the first programming language.
In the 1960s, both IBM employees and computers helped NASA control space flights - to Mercury, Saturn, and 1969 - man's flight to the moon.
In 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers, the IBM line system/360.
The classic PC, which defined the computer standards of the time, called IBM 5150, appeared on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold the manufacturing of computers to Chinese company Lenovo, while simultaneously acquiring the consultancy office PricewaterhouseCoopers, thus fully focused on consulting and high-value services.
Over the past three years, IBM has achieved great success with its Smarter Planet concept.
Its goal is to make reasonable use of technology in areas where this has not yet been planned, and to improve the road situation and urban governance.
In the field of commerce, IBM recently introduced a Smarter Commerce platform that helps businessmen control the entire trading cycle.
IBM’s traditions are strong even in our country.
In the former Czechoslovakia, as the first country to be simultaneously located in Central and Eastern Europe, IBM established its branch in 1932.
Today, IBM CZ also runs a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The headquarters of Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague, where there is also a world-class research team engaged in speech recognition.
Rhythm about his unfaithful husband:
Iveta, stay a fool, I don't need him anymore!
Darina Rikhtarzhova (53) said it's over!
After her husband Joseph Richterz (53) became the bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartoshova (45), Darina still hoped that he would wake up and return home.
However, she no longer wants to wait, and has set clear rules for her future life.
“The Pope may come home, but he is no longer my partner,” Rikhtarzhova explained.
When Darina Riktarzhova provided Bartoshova's blood in her home in the summer, she probably had no idea what would happen to her marriage.
And although she forced Yvette to leave Ryzh<0xC4><0x81>n 30 days later, Pepa did not leave the singer.
In addition, he publicly admitted that he loved her.
After some time Darina gave up, pretending to have calmed down her husband's novel; and now she finally said goodbye to him.
I don't care who his wife is sleeping with.
Even if Ritterz and Bartoshov ever break up, his wife won't accept him with his arms spread.
“He is the biological father of my sons and if he wants to spend his last days in our house, no one will expel him.”
"However, he will end his days not as my favorite, lost and found old fool, but as a person with whom I have something to do," Rikhtarzhova said, adding that she has already been freed from her husband and insists only on mutual respect.
As long as Joseph does not mind his wife rejecting him.
“I respect my wife’s decision.”
“I’m going to be with Yvette, I’m not going to change that.”
“My wife has decided to leave the marriage on paper, and I respect that decision.”
“Our union is still functioning; I’m responsible for repairs, gardening, home and shopping.”
“Darina and I communicate perfectly well, but we don’t share the bed anymore,” Richter told Blask magazine.
He claims that if Rytharzhova finds a new love, he will not interfere with her.
“We don’t sleep together, and I don’t care where she goes, with whom and if she has a boyfriend.
“I know it’s my fault, I fell in love with Yvette and I’m fully responsible,” Joseph said.
Women’s Worst Habits: Are They Affecting You?
When you ask men to name some typical female bad habits, they usually list them all right away.
Dear ladies, will you recognize yourself in the following lines describing several female habits that make men angry?
SHOPPING
Is your second half complaining that you’re constantly going shopping?
Do you need to buy at least one item each week?
Do you like to shop at large sales?
If so, then your shopping can be considered a bad habit.
Some women admit that they need to somehow control their passion for shopping.
And yet, which of you will refuse to walk around the clothes stores in search of the perfect fit clothes and sample it (preferably in different color options) in the samples?
Maybe shopping is a hobby for most women, but for men it can be a real hell.
Just remember how many times you told your second half to wait outside for you...
Eternal dissatisfaction
"Am I too fat?"
“I need to lose at least five pounds – maybe I should start doing gymnastics?”
"You're still attracted to me?"
Do you know these phrases?
- Yeah?
Then you join a group of women who are impaired in their appearance.
Not that you need to stop watching yourself, but many men literally have an allergy to the constant complaints of the partner about their appearance.
The strong sex also agrees that the more frequent such complaints occur, the more women irritate them.
Most importantly, order and cleanliness
It's like an endless story.
Glass washing, vacuum cleaner, floor washing, dust scrubbing, bath cleaning - at least twice a week.
Are you criticizing your partner for coming up on a clean cabin in dirty shoes; children for dirt in a clean sink and fingerprints on a window in the living room that was so difficult to clean?
In case you suffer from this “distortion,” try to realize that falling into extremes is not good; and that in your family order and cleanliness should not be the first priority.
Innocuous pursuit of cleanliness can threaten your relationship, as well as the whole family.
The Strength to Command
"Put the lingerie in the basket."
"Are you going to wear dirty socks tomorrow?"
"Black towels for dishes should not lie on the floor."
If you make remarks to your partner several times a day, he may find this very annoying.
Of course, you have good intentions, you just want everything to be perfect.
Perhaps if men had understood this, women wouldn’t have to command them so often.
Spletni
Some women like to plot, insult, and smear intrigue against others.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to discuss who, where, with whom, and why.
From time to time, each of us may be disconnected.
Let’s be honest, this is the nature of all women.
In any case, there are more serious conspirators, women who often plot and despise others. They, especially in the women's workforce, pose a greater danger to their surroundings.
The resulting transfers of Yagra and Vorachek helped Philadelphia win
During the NHL game on Monday, two successful transfers of hockey striker Yaromir Yagra helped Philadelphia to beat 5:3 on Carolina's ice. He again became the most successful Czech player of the game.
In both cases, Claude Jiru used the experience of the thirty-nine-year-old star; he added another transfer and was declared the best player of the match.
Two successful transfers of the match also belonged to the player in the same team with Yagro Yakubu Vora<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
After the game, Yagr told foreign journalists that he predicted a great evening to Jira.
"I told him before the game that he was going to kill the het-trick."
"I felt it."
“Sometimes you feel that sort of thing,” Yagri explained, after whose actions Jiru scored at the first opportunity that Flyers gave.
A little later the team's second goal also had a "Czech trail".
The closing Harrikeins Voracek took over the laundry and handed it to Maxim Talbot, who scored between the circles.
A second before the first break, home gamer Patrick Dwayer reduced the gap with a number of advantages, but at the beginning of the second tie again led the Flyers.
Especially Giraud.
After a successful Yagra, he scored a third goal; in the future, his hit was converted to a fourth goal by Wayne Simmonds.
“I like to play with him.”
“I don’t want to say he’s the best player in the league, but he’s definitely one of the top three,” Yagr said.
“I never thought that at the end of my career I would play with a hockey player like him.
"That makes me happy."
“I want to support him.”
"All these years in the NHL, my teammates tried to help me, and now it's my turn," Yagri added.
Carolina made the match more dramatic with the help of Tuomo Routh and Dwayne's penalty, shortening the gap to one goal.
Further complications were prevented by Matt Reed, who increased the gap to two points.
"Pronger was doing great in our area."
"He hit the sink, I hurried, and Reid went to the far end."
"I aimed at him and I'm glad it worked out," Voraczek described his impression from the last goal of the game.
The victory led Philadelphia to the first place in the Eastern Conference.
Montreal team defender Yaroslav Spachek did not finish the match with Buffalo; he left the game in the second period due to injury to the upper body.
Along with the season-experienced defender, the Canadians lost their two-point lead and lost 2–3 after a penalty shootout.
Thomas Plekanets was unable to shoot during one of their attacks.
More than lost points, the home coach was saddened by a large number of injuries in the back row, as the match ended with only five defenders.
"The situation is bad."
“We ended the game with only one experienced player, the rest were young people.
“However, we can’t do anything about it, we just have to deal with it,” said Jacques Martin.
“Replaced by replacement, it was amazing and we couldn’t resist.”
"We needed to simplify the game, move the laundry from our zone."
"What was our weak side," said defender P.K. Subban.
After thirty strikes, Czech goalkeeper Onjay Pavelets helped Winnipegs defeat Tampa Bay 5:2.
The naked Jets, who interrupted the five-match series of defeats, were beaten by five different players.
The dynamics of travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, only five state travel agencies were able to work in the former Czechoslovakia: <0xC4><0x8C>edok, Sporturist, CKM, Recrea and Autoturist.
Because travel to the West was severely restricted, the travel agencies of the time mainly sold tours to the countries of the socialist bloc.
Thus, during the holidays, Czech tourists travelled to the German Democratic Republic; the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea on the Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (both countries on the Black Sea); and Hungary (Balaton).
The only exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when we had the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia. Then the Yugoslav regime turned to the West, which resulted in significant restrictions on the travel of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia.
The great paradox of the socialist period was that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. Czechoslovakia) were not allowed individual trips to socialist countries.
If a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel on his own, for example, to the Soviet Union or Poland, a letter of invitation from that country was required; otherwise, individual travel was not possible.
At the time, the travel agencies offered to travel to the West, but it was either to stay in line all night, with a sleeping bag, or to have "good friends" in the agency.
And that's not all.
Currency permits were required for travel to the West. It was not issued to politically unreliable people who were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not freely convertible; it was impossible to obtain money (western currency) for a trip to the West without a currency permit.
Most often, the Czechs spent their holidays at home, which led to the emergence of a large number of cottages and summer houses, this habit remains to this day.
Since 1989, tourism in the Czech Republic has thus undergone a real revolution.
While until 1989 the holidays in the DPR or Bulgaria were the culmination of our travels, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million holidays in countries around the world.
The great paradox that we no longer realize is that until 1989 we could not freely visit the most popular Croatia today, as it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
In early 1990, the need to obtain a visa to the neighbouring countries of Western Europe was abolished, which led to a huge wave of short trips mainly to Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not be satisfied with travelling to the West. Everyone wanted to go there at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris, Czech tourists slept in parks in tents, as their income at the time was lacking in a hotel or pension.
A typical feature of Czech tourism in that period was the desire to bring their own food (canned, salami, etc.) to save money.
Another important point is the introduction of the freely convertible Czech crown. After decades our tourists can finally freely buy the Western currency.
Our standard of living and average income increased, leading to another important circumstance around 1997.
Since 1997, the increased demand has allowed travel agencies to prepare regular flights operated by charter airlines. Compared to the past, airline tickets have now become incredibly cheap thanks to the ability to book wholesale discounts.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs did not need a visa to visit almost all the developed countries of the world except the United States. This made our travels even easier.
The next major event in the history of post-revolution travel took place in 2000. Great demand led to the first historically direct charter flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country, Thailand.
Since then, direct charter flights are delivering Czech tourists to warm exotic countries. This winter flights from the Czech Republic will be sent to twelve exotic destinations.
Currently, about 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
And another important event of this period, symbolizing our post-revolutionary development, occurred in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the U.S. canceled the visa requirement for Czech tourists. Our country, thus, has forever joined the most developed countries in the world.
For the first time in history in 2008, the Czechs spent more than half of their holiday abroad (50.3%); and for the first time in history, they spent more than 15,000 kroner per person during the holiday abroad, including their expenses at the destination.
The General Assembly must elect the President, the threat of path is coming back
For about five months, Czech football had no president. There is a risk that the successor of Ivan Ga<0xC5><0xA1>ek, the head of the Czech Football Association (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R) will not be named even after another extraordinary general meeting to be held in Nimburk.
There is still no consensus on what election rules to follow.
Without this, the vote for one of the three candidates will not begin.
Yindrich Reichl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomash Paczlik are eager to lead Czech football.
Ga<0xC5><0xA1>ek left his post in June, leaving, he urged his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality that would lead football in the future.
However, the Ga<0xC5><0xA1>ek era once again plunged football into a dispute between the two chambers of the association that could not choose a single candidate.
This became clear on September 16, when a new president was to be elected.
Delegates of the general assembly arrived at the National House in Prague, Smihov, as negotiations remained blocked, not just through the election process.
There was no consensus as to who had the right to vote in the General Assembly - only legal representatives or officials who had been given authority.
This point has since been partially settled thanks to the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which representation based on the powers granted is impossible.
Controversy over the rules of the election, however, continues.
The Executive Board was also not very helpful, although at its meetings, both regular and extraordinary, it was mainly concerned with this issue.
The notion of voting methods has changed several times, but the key issue remains the same.
The question is, how do you get to the 3rd round and avoid the path?
“The dispute is whether to follow the established norms or to find another model,” says one of the vice-presidents of FA<0xC4><0x8C>R Dushan Svoboda, who represents professional football in the management of the association.
Based on the model provided for by the Statute, the winner of the 3rd round is a candidate who has received much support from the chamber from which he stands as a candidate.
It is alleged that Moravia agrees to a compromise to consider the winner of the election of the candidate with the highest number of voters in both houses.
The Czech side insists on the condition that the winner should receive at least two-thirds of the vote in the overall percentage.
"However, the previous two rounds would then lose their meaning; this would completely reject the concept of the two chambers," Svoboda agrees with Moravia's arguments. He says that it would be better not to change the rules and vote in accordance with existing norms.
Some unexpectedly, Tomas Paclick agrees with his opinion, although it is estimated that the rules of election determined by the Statute fit Pelt more than other candidates.
"I would like the elections to take place as far as possible in accordance with the Statute."
“I want to avoid all sorts of representative nonsense, as in the previous general assembly,” said owner Victoria Pilsen, who is a candidate for the first time; and in his statements he largely contradicted Pelte.
Pelta remains an optimist.
He believes that the new president will be known in Nimburg; he also hopes that candidates will cooperate constructively in the future.
“All the emotional horrors will calm down after today’s expected national team out in the European Championships.”
"Football will again be on the happy wave, people will be more willing to cooperate," says Jablonetz representative. Of the three candidates, he has the most experience in football management both at the professional and regional level.
Richard is more restrained.
"I'm hoping for an agreement, but the situation is very ambiguous."
“This is not between representatives of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are attempts to deliberately adapt the rules.”
"This could cause another collapse of the general assembly."
"I hope that common sense will win," said Reichl.
There is not much time left for the parties to reach an agreement.
According to some reports, separate negotiations took place directly in Montenegro; but who knows if soccer unity will be achieved before the match.
An additional flight, which was to be delivered, among others, by Vice Presidents Dalibor Kucher and Reichl to Podgorica, did not depart in the morning due to a technical failure. They were looking for an alternative to deliver part of the executive committee to the place of the transfer.
In the end, the ministerial meeting, which is expected to be on Wednesday, could be decisive.
The Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, Jozef Dobe<0xC5><0xA1>, would like the opposition parties as part of the country’s strongest sports association to come to an agreement.
There is a lot on the map: government subsidies; the creditworthiness of football; and the planned general meeting of <0xC4><0x8C>STV with the new Czech sport management after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclick enters the presidential race because he doesn’t see the right candidate
If, before the extraordinary general assembly, the head of football players Pilsen Tomash Paclik had seen a strong candidate who would meet all his requirements for the president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), he would not even claim a high position.
“If I were a decent candidate, I would have fought for him and not participated in the fight myself.”
"But such a man has not been found yet," said Paclik <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
Paclik’s motive for joining the fight with Miroslav Pelta and Yindrzhih Reich is to try to prevent Pelte, the alleged favorite of the elections, from entering the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R administration.
In addition, Paclick stresses that if he wins, he will only remain president until 2013, when another general meeting is planned.
In the future, he would like this post to be taken by an experienced top manager, not too related to football life.
“I’ve talked to a few people I could think of.”
“It was awful to me to hear some of them say they don’t even want to have anything to do with Czech football right now.”
“I would like to change that opinion,” he said.
Currently, the main disagreement of Paclick with Pelta is related to the relationship of the latter with Roman Berbrom, president of the regional football association in Pilsen. Berbro is a person of a controversial reputation, who is known behind the scenes as an influential lobbyist, able to influence the general's slogan.
Paclick therefore considers it unacceptable for Pelta to become president.
"If he wins, the current situation will remain unchanged and football will not move forward."
“With the support of Berber, a capable businessman, it would be even more damaging to football,” Paclick said.
He suggests the fact that a few years ago Pelta’s name was recorded while listening to the phones while investigating the corruption case; Pelta managed to avoid the sentence.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta's victory would bring to football."
"And what we would look like in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," Paclick said. He is not now mentioning his previous statement that he will "sell the Pilsen club if Pelta becomes president".
If Paclick wins on Thursday, he could present a partnership with Pelta in the future.
This opinion is shared by another candidate, Reichl, whom Paclick supported before the general assembly in September that ended the fiasco.
“He would be the first one I’d call on.”
"He's very capable."
"I can introduce him to the team."
"But he can't run the association."
"I also don't rub my nose in what I don't understand," said Paczlik, who attracted a lot of attention in September when he supported the removal of the Judicial Brigade led by Ludek Macela, who was replaced by Dagmar Damkov.
Paclick says he will risk running the association.
He refers to his experience in managing private companies; since last summer he has run the Pilsen team, which with his help celebrated his first triumph in the league in May.
“I have the power to make the football environment change, to support its change for the better.”
"Limit the influence of some groups of individuals who tend to influence the disciplinary and appeals council, which leads to disgusting situations," Paclik said. He does not hide his antipathy, for example, to Sport Director Daniel Krzetinsky.
One of his priorities will be to strengthen the relationship between FA<0xC4><0x8C>R and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he will lobby at the highest political level to allocate more money to the sport from lottery fees.
“This is one of the key points that a new president must address.”
“If gambling is taxed, as political parties claim, I understand their arguments, but they must clearly state where the money will go,” he said.
Paclick does not consider his relationship with the Pilsen club a burden, although he claims that the president of FA<0xC4><0x8C>R should be independent.
Pelta is associated with Jablonec, and Reichl with the Prague Duke.
"This is not the perfect option."
"And yet I don't see any sense in the hypocritical transfer of my shares of the Pilsen Club to someone else, once I'm going to go back there in six months," Paclick said.
Pelta promised new FA<0xC4><0x8C>R rules that will allow to avoid the Election Path
Two days before the general meeting of the football association, one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if elected, he would fight for the new rules of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R in order to avoid disputes over the rules of the election in the future.
Before the negotiations on Thursday in Nimburk, Jablonec’s official remains optimistic and believes that attention from the pre-election fight will significantly distract from today’s expected success of our football team.
Before the failed elections in September, Pelta promised that if he wins, he would focus both on the mission and on getting funding.
He decided to take part in the election at the last moment before the last general meeting. A two-month delay, thus, could be useful for him to defend his ideas about football in a wider context.
"People at all levels have been in football for a long time, and they expect the president to be known on Thursday."
“They feel it’s time for someone to lead the association,” says the man, mainly associated with the club Jablonets; but he spent many years in Sparta and the executive committee of the association.
This gives him reason to assume that he is experienced enough to manage Czech football.
He believes that the current problems are caused by the euphoria that reigned during the reign of Ivan Ga<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
"Unfortunately, the rules that were not as perfect as we all thought were adopted at the general meeting in June."
“If the different ways of representation had not been adopted, we would have had a president since September,” Pelta said.
It referred to the rewriting of a key document of the civil association as a false objective for delegates.
“If I become president, I will consider it my personal task, and I’m going to take personal responsibility if this attempt fails.”
“This is a fundamental issue without which we cannot exist,” Pelta says.
In addition, he says he is not trying to stand out against the background of rivals.
In the past, he had already stated that he could present his cooperation with Yindrich Reich, whom he appreciated for his legal education; he is quite aware of the fact that his rival candidate should become his first vice president.
For a long time he did not attack Thomas Paclick, who was constantly criticizing Pelt.
“He has been in football for over a year and has achieved some success.”
“Either way, his attacks were inappropriate, and many people were surprised by the methods of his election campaign.”
"Although, therefore, some of them are now doubting his true identity," Pelta said of his competitor. Pelta himself claims that he is faithful to the statements he announced in September.
He considers his knowledge of football to be his main weapon, from competitions at the lowest level to the national team.
The national team must represent the whole of football.
“I would also try to stop all incidents, starting with the Bohemian case or the consequences of last year’s corruption scandal.”
“Right after that, I would focus on negotiating with both the private and public sectors to guarantee enough money for the whole football,” the forty-six-year-old candidate said two months ago.
He then promised that his election to the post of football chief would not result in the dismissal of staff.
"I'm going to need to know the official instructions of the individual employees." It was his message to the Insurance Company, where the lengthy period of interpolation is causing a clear nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios accompanying the planned general assembly, he believes that delegates will not come to Nimburg on Thursday in vain.
“If the only controversial question is how to hold the third round elections, we can deal with it.”
“Football needs the trust it can get, only by finally choosing its leader,” says Pelta, who remains an optimist two days before the key day of his career.
Rikhl promises that under his leadership FA<0xC4><0x8C>R will start actively working
If the current vice-president, Yindrzhih Reichl, becomes the president of the Czech Football Association at the meeting on Thursday, many people in the Association, according to rumors, will be dissatisfied.
Rahul promises that if he is chosen, there will be a time of hard work.
He wants to make changes to the system and make members of the executive committee responsible for certain areas of football.
He also promises to solve the Bohemian problem; to improve relations with both UEFA and FIFA; to attract more money to football; and to continue the work of the previous president, Ivan Ga<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“As president, I would like to focus on football as a whole.
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to the national team, professional football and youth football events," he said.
“This is not what I want to say that I will do everything myself,” Reichl said in an interview with <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
“I’m a team player and I want to allocate powers on the executive committee so that each member focuses on a specific area.”
“I will carefully allocate the tasks so that in each of these segments, football takes a big step forward.”
“This is probably not going to be liked by many people, because it will mean hard work, not just criticizing the work of others,” he added.
The atmosphere of criticism in the football movement allegedly made him question his candidacy.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
“But I need to know if there is any meaning in this; and that I will not be surrounded by people who put sticks in my wheels and question my every step,” he explained.
“However, many people have told me that I shouldn’t give up, otherwise others will come.”
"It's a trust I can't throw away," he said.
What’s more, he says his motivation is to continue the work he started with Ga<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“A lot of work has been done in the last two years, and I don’t want to overlook all of this.”
“There have been processes that can bring results in a few years, and I don’t want anyone else to stop them,” he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, was elected, the situation in the Association could return to what was before Ga<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“I believe in a systematic approach, and that’s something that Mirek Pelt is unlikely to be competent to do.”
"He's surrounded by people who would play soccer so that it's only accessible to the chosen."
“I can be blamed for a lot, but certainly not subjectivity.”
“I’m trying to be objective.”
“I want to make football accessible to everyone, because then everyone will have a good time, not just the chosen minority,” he said.
Moreover, he denies the allegations that he will only be President of the Czech Republic.
“While many people are trying to say the opposite, I plan to do the most for Moravia.”
“For example, it’s time to think about splitting the second league into the Czech and Moravian sides, the winners of which would continue the fight in the first league.”
"This will prevent the current situation where there are only three Moravian teams in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravian," said Raichl.
While Pilsen's manager Thomas Paclick joined the presidential squad, Reichl did not dare to assess his chances of winning.
"However, I still feel strong support in the Czech House, which chose me as its vice president, and I see that I have achieved some obvious success," said Reichl. "To his successes, he has been able to save tens of millions of kronor.
On the other hand, he partially blames himself for the fact that there is no unity in the association.
Claiming that Pelta was “excluded from the process of returning credit to Czech football,” he considers another rival, Paclik, a strong candidate who has something to offer.
“No one can doubt that he has done a great job in Pilsen this year.”
"If he is elected, I hope he will continue what Ivan Ga<0xC5><0xA1>ek has started, without any significant staff changes in the committees."
"He wouldn't have distorted the facts for his own benefit," said Richard of his rival.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Jump into the water
Yulia Stanek
Children's pools with universal fiber optics and status pools in Budapest. Travelers can taste the incredible waters of Europe - and relax the tired body in a jacuzzi after a city tour or walk.
A book can tell you where the best water is.
Without one thing, Iris Mader couldn’t do during her research trips for the last one and a half years: without her swimsuit.
lying on her back in the water, she looked up at the tastefully decorated domes, floated to the marble cherubs awaiting her by the edge of the pool, and enjoyed the carefully restored swimming pools in the style of ar-nouvo.
She was eager to add every pool she liked to her notebook – with important details about the building’s construction and history.
Architecture historian Meder has explored more than 200 swimming pools - and now has gathered impressions in her recently published book Badfreuden (The Joy of Swimming), where everything came from the public pools of the Beton in Munich to the historic bathing palaces in Chevrolet.
Her "travel in the most unusual swimsuits in Central Europe" led her through 13 countries. In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited swimsuits in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia and Hungary.
The 46-year-old author is a true enthusiasm for swimming culture.
She has very little enthusiasm for sports, says Meder, but in the water everything is different.
The only drawback is that swimmers should indulge in the blue caffeine tile and the smell of chlorine, while runners can breathe in the enticing smell of soft forests or listen to the cheerful birding in the park.
“I once wondered why swimming pools should always be so terrible,” says Meder, a Viennese resident.
“That’s how I started collecting beautiful pools.”
When the Surface Doubles the Architecture
Spreading in the pool and refined oils in the sauna is a health factor in the bathrooms is so significant, because, according to Meder, all feelings are stimulated.
And swimming pools can be a real pleasure for the eyes if the builders take on such work. "Instead of the floor in the pool you have the surface of the water."
“The surface is very transparent, but also reflects the beauty of the entire building.”
Everything is reflected visually: high ceilings, colored tiles and trampolines.
The 190-page illustrated edition of The Joy of Swimming contains valuable information about the architectural and cultural history of health oases – and you want to jump into the water.
Watercolor collector Meder has discovered several outstanding specimens during a study in Hungary.
She discovered a nitrate-rich water in the karst cave (Cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolce) and a thermal bath filled with alkaline water, in the building, built in the form of a bottle (Városi Termálfürd<0xC5><0x91>, as well as a bubble bottle)
From the many heated outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria, on the other hand, there is a stunning view. You can see the whole of Zurich from a bath on the roof or see the snowy Arlberg. The cottage is a cottage from the outdoor pool in St. Anthony. There is a window in the park.
Probably the most unusual design awaits swimmers in Langenfeld. The Aqua collection in Ettal looks like a UFO that just landed in the Alps.
In winter, a pair of three open canyons emerge from it, which seem to be quite small in the background of the Eztal Mountains.
Category: Alhambra in Schwarzwald
The pool collector Meder did not meet the smell of chlorine in every pool.
Many thermal baths smell grey. The bathrooms of Arpad in Bekeshchabe smell so strongly of oil that you may find it difficult to believe that you are in a healing source.
The smell is caused by hydrocarbons in alkaline water. The water is almost black from the yolk, which sticks to the skin as soon as you immerse yourself in the pool - a healing experience of a certain type.
Iris Meder, however, at some point was disappointed in her search for beautiful places to swim. When she tried to visit the open swimming pool of Czech baths in Lugachevice, she found that the territory was sealed.
The bathrooms, designed by the architect Dushan Yurkovich in 1902, were closed.
When Meder looked into the outer windows of the red-white-yellow building in the style of ar-neuvo, she saw the sprouts growing between the caffeine tiles.
One of the places where the destruction was stopped on hot tracks is the amazing swimming pool in Schwarzwald – the Thermal Water Palace in Bad Wildbad.
The pools have already passed through three stages of construction. You will discover not only the neo-Roman elements of the period after construction in 1844, but also the Mauritian hall in the style of Alhambra, added around 1900.
After a thorough reconstruction in 1995, the Thermal Palace – the favorite swimming pool of Iris Meder – is not only because it is from Schwarzwald.
"This is a real achievement - so crafty to combine such different architectural styles," says Meder.
Getting into a thermal pool in such a palace is clearly a secondary occupation.
Speculation of Agricultural Producers
Doyce Bank is investigating the trade in agricultural products.
Christian Tyves
Will Doyce Bank stop trading in agricultural products?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Joseph Ackermann gave the working group the task of investigating the effects of speculation on the poor around the world.
The Executive Director plans to make changes in January.
Hamburg - Hamburg
For German citizens, the situation is clear. According to one study, 84 percent of Germans consider it unacceptable that banks speculate on agricultural products such as wheat and corn.
Two-thirds of respondents are demanding that the Doicha Bank and other banks stop trade in agricultural products as trade exacerbates the problems facing the poorest people around the world.
The findings were made in a study conducted by the Forsa Institute of Social Research and Statistical Analysis from the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is based on a report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author of the report, Harald Schuman, demonstrates that the game of betting on global commodity exchanges is raising prices – and banks are thus involved in global hunger.
The campaign of consumer interests advocates is directed directly against the head of the Doyce Bank, Joseph Ackermann, although large banks such as Godman Sax and Morgan Stanley trade the same.
Initially, betting on goods was designed as a means of protecting traders from price fluctuations.
In any case, most experts now agree that players have abandoned the rules of supply and demand – and are earning at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, Akkermann responded to criticism, promising to investigate the allegations, saying that no trade "is worth risking the good reputation of the Doyce Bank."
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, the international working group is currently investigating the allegations contained in the Foodwatch report.
The investigation should be completed by the end of the year, when the results will be submitted to the Board of Directors of the Doyce Bank - with recommendations for action.
The head of the bank then plans to announce the changes that follow the investigation at the end of January.
Trade in goods may decline or cease to exist.
Akermann is working on his image.
Foodwatch President Tilo Bode was pleased with the news, stressing his critical attitude towards the financial sector. "The rise in food prices is a striking example of how banks are currently acting recklessly against the common interest."
As the chief lobbyist of the bank, Akkermann has a certain responsibility, according to Bode.
“The bank should remove from the portfolio all the investments that make money bets on food prices,” Bode said.
“It doesn’t matter if it’s about starving people or the reputation of the Doyce Bank.”
Akkermann’s quick reaction at first is surprising, but in the meantime, the director would like to have a flawless image just a few months before his office stay.
Doyce Bank announced on Monday that the chairman would not move to the supervisory board as planned.
The abolition of the speculative controversy in the food market could improve his image.
He also hardly needs to worry about expenses - with the consequences, he will have to deal with his successor.
One in two would refuse to invest in commodities.
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager.
To date, more than 30,000 internet users have joined the organization’s campaign.
Bode published the study on Tuesday. The study was conducted for the Forsa Institute of Social Research and Statistical Analysis on November 7 and 8, and 1001 people participated.
No more than eleven percent believe that investments that make a bet on the price of food are acceptable to the Doyce Bank.
Many banking clients would also take concrete steps if they found their bank was involved in such a trade. According to the study, one in two would withdraw deposits that ultimately lead to speculation of commodities.
43 percent would recommend leaving the bank, 49 percent said they would consider closing the account and switching to another bank.
House of the 21st Century in Vienna
The Pavilion in a New Place
Ingeborg Winsovski
Architectural history with rises, falls and a happy ending. The Pavilion of Austria for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, was emptied and was abandoned.
It is now reopened as an exhibition centre.
The Pavilion of Austria, designed by Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels, is a well-known example of modern post-war architecture with its simple shapes, glass halls, bold expressions of faith in technical progress.
Pavilion Schwanzer won the Grand Prix of Architecture in 1958 for its lightweight steel and glass damper construction.
The building is considered a milestone in modern architecture.
This made the architect so famous that he also built the pavilion of Austria at the next World Exhibition.
In the end, he became famous around the world in 1973 for his legendary four-cylinder tower BMW and his sister – a cup-shaped building.
The pavilion, designed as a building for temporary exhibitions, was moved to the Swiss Garden near Vienna's South Station, converted and opened as a 20th century museum in 1962 - and is often referred to as the "House of the 20th century" for this reason.
In any case, the building was not suitable for the museum for technical and spatial considerations - it had no walls on which artwork could be hung, and poor air conditioning.
However, it continued to be used until modern art in Vienna received a new home.
The house has been empty since 2001, and its condition has gotten worse and worse.
Architect Adolf Krishnitz has to date restored the pavilion, which was called the "House of the 21st Century" and will be used as a museum of contemporary art.
This museum – the Belvedere Museum’s branch, which will open its first exhibition on Tuesday evening – is a joyful event in every sense.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Belvedere Austrian Gallery in 2007, contributed to the new venture.
Husslein-Arco, a graduate of the Faculty of History of Arts with a brilliant career as a figurine artist in her youth, who worked at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum, and eventually became the founder and director of the Museum of Modernity's arts.
The new museum was to house a permanent exhibition of the Fritz Votruba Foundation, a café and a bookstore along with contemporary art. The office building was also to be built.
Strict control & limited budget
Krishanitz was then the perfect candidate for the project.
He was known, of course, for the restoration and expansion of the Vienna Session by Joseph Olbrich, and won the contest, but he also studied at Schwanzer at the University of Technology, and the pavilion was an "extremely important place" for him, where he attended exhibitions "nowhere".
He knew the original design and the tasks that stood before the building, a building that had already lost some of its greatness and lightness when it was moved to Vienna and converted.
The problems that arose during the last restructuring were much more serious. The building was a "absorber of energy", says Krishnitz.
Window profiles on the glass facade were replaced, fiberglass reinforced safety glass was inserted, and the glass roof was replaced by a high-strength safety glass.
The steel transfers of the thermal bridge were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos was removed from the ceilings.
The two lower floors created a space for the new use of the building, the light well between the building and the street provides lighting - a virtually new building, but still the exquisite Pavilion of Schwanzer.
The original exterior doors were preserved, and the building was decorated in an old red-brown color of corrosion protection.
The cinema hall is the same as it used to be.
All this under the strict control of the museum management and with a limited budget.
“We often had to find material that was good, cheap and would have been approved by the museum management,” Krishnitz says, pointing to the uneven floor in the basement.
The building remained flexible and light, despite limitations, problems and transformations.
K<0xE1><0xB9><0x9B><0xE1><0xB9><0xA3><0xE1><0xB9><0x87>itz recently noted that the pavilion "from Brussels" was a rough - a typical story of "a chapel in the city".
Such architecture is “not always in its place” and nevertheless wants to “stimulate real awareness”.
The house of the 21st century is in the very right place, as there was unexpected luck in the planning of the city. A completely rebuilt "main station district" with offices and residential properties grows around the Swiss Garden.
A second happy event may take place. The 21st century house can be complemented by the second building of Krishnitz - the collector Francesco von Habsburg acquired the Temporary Exhibition Hall of Berlin and, as reported, is negotiating with the city in its location.
Deutsche Bahn Plans Multimillion Winter Anti-Crisis Package
Deutsche Bahn has announced an anti-crisis plan to avoid the cancellation of trains in the winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
The cost will be millions of euros.
According to the newspaper, Deutsche Bahn will spend an additional <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70 million this year to avoid winter delays and train delays.
Referring to the internal anti-crisis plan of Deutsche Bahn, Bild reports that by 2015, investments totalling around 300 million euros are planned.
The investments are designed to improve the performance of locomotives and the rail network even in extreme weather conditions.
The number of own and engaging staff involved in snow clearing from roads and platforms will be doubled to 16,000.
The goal is to clean the platforms from snow and ice before the start of operation and 90 percent of the required arrows within four to five hours.
Rüdiger Grube, head of Deutsche Bahn, warned of the possibility of train cancellations and delays this winter at a meeting with government and industry leaders two months ago.
Last winter, Deutsche Bahn experienced considerable difficulties with passenger transport as it lacked reserves at the time of deterioration of weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for the approval of the Federal Railway Service for years.
There were also some delays in the delivery of ICE trains.
Deutsche Bahn has also had to check the axis of the ICE trains much more often over the years after one of the ICE trains broke the axis at the main station in Cologne.
Doyce Bank will pay millions of pounds of fine in the US
New troubles came following the tensions around Joseph Akkermann, CEO of Doyce Bank: Doyce Bank threatens a fine in the U.S. of many millions of pounds.
According to Doyce Bank had little problem at home, the past of the industrial giant in the US now pushed it. Doyce Bank with head office in Frankfurt will pay <0x24>145 million (106 million bucks) to settle the disputes that came after bankruptcy.
The problem arose around the sale of mortgage bonds.
The National Credit Unions Administration (NCUA), the regulator of the financial market, accuses a number of major banks of using false promises to trick credit unions into buying their financial products.
The price of bonds fell sharply during the financial crisis and dragged credit unions down.
“We are pleased to have resolved this problem without the parties to the court,” said a spokesman for the Doyce Bank in New York.
In the agreement, the bank did not acknowledge its guilt.
The same is true for Citigroup, which has agreed to pay <0x24>20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the rapid reaction of both banks.
The National Credit Unions Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. credit unions and intervenes in bankruptcy processes to protect consumer deposits.
The NCUA is fighting for compensation for the losses that are spilled out of billions.
This is the first such agreement.
The regulator also drew attention to other major banks and raised a case in the summer against JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
Dubious mortgage bonds are so-called securities secured by the pool of mortgage loans.
They are supported by internal loans.
This led to the fate of a number of financial companies when a bubble broke in the US real estate market in 2007.
The US investment bank Lehman Brothers ordered to live long in September 2008 on the brink of a financial crisis.
A few years later, banks in the United States are still fighting the storm.
Investors and regulators have filed a large number of claims, requiring to pay compensation or punish fraudsters.
The largest wave of claims is the Federal Agency for Housing Finance (FHFA).
It accuses the 18 largest international banks of acquiring <0x24>200 billion in deposit agreements from American credit organizations Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
The bank also faces the threat of prosecution by the FHFA over a number of <0x24>14.2 billion total agreements concluded between 2005 and 2007.
The regulator is demanding that a bank headquartered in Frankfurt take responsibility for "substantial losses", but has not yet indicated the exact amount.
Doyce Bank rejected the claims as unfounded and reported its intention to challenge them.
Warren Buffett invests <0x24>10 billion in IBM
Financial guru Buffett is actively investing in IBM’s IT company.
Since March, he has bought shares for a total of more than <0x24>10 billion.
To date, the largest U.S. investor Warren Buffett has always said he is not investing in computer and IT companies, as their long-term development is difficult to predict.
However, IBM’s annual report changed its opinion on investments in the industry.
According to Buffett, he should have understood much earlier that IBM primarily offers services and buys computer systems for IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, Warren Buffett’s investment was regarded as a knighthood.
IBM, a veteran of the IT industry, has now received the title of "Sir IBM".
In an interview with CNBC, Buffett said it had acquired IBM shares for a total of <0x24>10.7 billion since March.
Its investment holding Berkshire Hathaway became one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said that even IBM didn’t know anything about his involvement until recently.
He praised the management, who managed to make profits even during the financial crisis.
“They did a great job,” Buffett said, referring to the management strategy.
IBM has been focused for a considerable time on high-performance IT services such as data centers.
The founder of the computer industry, who has been for more than 100 years now, also offers software and consulting services, as well as powerful computers for business.
To date, Buffett has avoided technology companies.
He said he only invests in companies whose business he understands.
and has invested, for example, in freight rail transport, in the production of lubricants and in mechanical engineering.
Berkshire Hathaway owns shares in a long list of major companies such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (former Municher Rück), along with some 80 of its own subsidiaries.
The 81-year-old acquired the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and, with the help of skillful investments, built one of the most expensive companies in the world.
His way of life, however, remained modest,
making it a cult figure for countless investors all over the world.
His almost unmistakable money making instincts gave him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha".
IBM’s stock price rose 1% before market openings after Buffett’s investment announcement.
The “black giant,” as IBM also calls it, stands on the stock market for over <0x24>220 billion, making it one of the most expensive high-tech companies in the world along with Apple and Microsoft.
Buffett, however, said he was not going to invest in Microsoft.
Its founder Bill Gates is his close friend.
The Inevitable Danger
After the discovery of a "chick in Zwickau" Turkish media began to question the rule of law in Germany.
One of the newspapers talks about a “blood ideology” that is now rising to the surface again.
The killings of eight Turkish and one Greek businessman between 2000 and 2006 were the result of right-wing extremist ideology.
Fear and concern have become a response to this message in Turkey and in the German-Turkish community of Germany.
For many Turks in Germany, this news has brought long-forgotten fears to life. There have been no such right-wing attacks on Turks since the fires in Melbourne in November 1992 and in Zolingen in May 1993.
There has never been any doubt, however, that xenophobia exists in Germany.
However, the right-wing extremist network now discovered has a scale that is not yet fully conscious.
"The Rebirth of Blood Ideology?" was the title of the online version of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
The Sabah newspaper, on the other hand, notes that one of the perpetrators was a secret intelligence officer for the secret services, and expresses concern that the German authorities may be drawn into the right-wing extremist bay.
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) reacted calmly, reminding victims of racial hatred with a silent picket across the Brandenburg Gate this weekend.
Just two weeks ago, the Turkish municipality of Berlin celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish bilateral agreement on the recruitment of workers at a ceremony with German and Turkish politicians.
Cooperation between the two countries was presented in a positive light – as a success story.
"Gift from Germany on the Fiftyth Anniversary" is the title of one of the articles on the Turkish internet portal "Haber X", commenting on the circumstances of the series of murders.
The German edition of Hürriyet also did not miss the occasion to carry out this parallel.
"It starts to smell bad" is the name of the column of Ahmet Kulakhji.
He notes that people who paid taxes and contributed substantially to the transformation of Germany were killed.
The behavior of the police and the subsequent successful seizure were severely criticized on German-Turkish internet forums.
The authors were asked why the German authorities did not think before to monitor suspects in right-wing extremist circles.
Some authors have come to a rather sharp rhetoric: "If they continue to act equally decisively, migrants will have no choice but armed self-defense."
"This will be the best self-defense."
“The world in Germany depends very much on how the entire network will be opened and on the legality of the punishment,” writes Selen.
The crimes in Mühlen and Zolingen in the 1990s were an example of the threat of peace in Germany.
The photograph of the burning ruins in Zolingen was deeply captured in the memory of the Germans and Turks.
No other event has shown the Turks living here so clearly that they are in danger, and the Germans that distrust and indifference can flow into real violence.
These crimes, however, increased the sense of unity of the Turks.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
The Turkish press during that period condemned the failure of the German police after the attacks. Helmut Kol refused to visit the survivors in Melln.
He sent a telegram of condolences to the President of Turkey after the burns in Zolingen, but the participation in the memorial ceremony in Cologne was accepted by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel in his speech calculated the taxes that the Turks pay in Germany,
It is as if he has determined the value of a person by the taxes that he pays.
The current illumination in the Turkish media once again showed how the distrust of many German Turks towards the present German state has deepened since then.
It has clearly shown what needs to be done now in addition to efforts to identify and reassess right-wing extremist terrorist organizations in Germany.
Banking scandal on Lake Zurich
Most of Europe’s leading risky banking policies are not in France or Italy, but in Switzerland.
UBS barely went bankrupt during the financial crisis and has been struggling with one crisis ever since.
Now the German has to get him back to the right course.
Alex Weber probably didn’t suspect that he would miss this role.
In July, after his impressive resignation from the post of head of the Federal Bank, it was announced that he would begin work on a no less impressive post in 2013 - the chairman of the board of directors of the largest Swiss bank UBS; an unexpected and profitable career.
Alex Weber was clearly thrilled, praised Switzerland for its beauty, UBS for its renewed strength, and made a few friendly remarks to his future colleagues.
“UBS has changed for the better.”
“I look forward to working with Caspar Filler and Oswald Grübel.
But in September it became clear that everything would be completely different.
UBS trader in London has circumvented the bank’s security systems and lost about 1.7 billion euros.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, a banker known not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the chairman of the board of directors of UBS has been considered sick, and everyone wants to know: when will Alex Weber finally take office?
Weber has been consulting the bank since February 2012.
And, as the bank said on Tuesday, he will be the chairman of the council in May, not in 2013.
It's not going to be easy for Alex Weber.
He is a professor of economics and a specialist of the Central Bank, not a traditional banker, and he will undoubtedly need time to adapt.
He was suddenly responsible for the bank’s strategy, which once again proved that he had long earned the title of “the biggest banking scandal in Europe.”
UBS, on the one hand, is very large - until recently it managed the largest assets in the world - and on the other hand - does not come out of the scandals.
The proud Swiss bank doesn’t seem to be saving anything.
It all started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had a good reputation.
The bank has combined the image of a hidden and sustainable, but at the same time a prolific asset manager with ambitious goals and aspirations to become the largest player in investment banking.
As a result, in 2007 UBS managed 1.6 billion, thus having more wealthy clients in the management of money than any other bank in the world.
As an investment bank, he joined the world’s largest banks.
It made an impression.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and banking professor who has been a longtime lecturer at the Institute of Banking at the University of Zurich, explains: “I have always brought my UBS students as a model of a good bank.”
“I know what we know now, you can ask me how I could have been so wrong.”
He was really wrong.
It was only in 2007 that it became clear that something was wrong with UBS.
In the middle of the year, CEO Peter Wuffly, who was considered an outstanding intellectual and equally brilliant banker, suddenly quit his position.
A few months later, we were able to guess why he left.
The bank’s investment unit tried to play on substandard securities and was forced to write off billions.
You want to believe it or not, but UBS has reported an increase in capital of 13 billion Swiss francs to counter the crisis.
The bank has indeed managed to find investors - but investors whose services many bankers would have politely refused recently - one very opaque Asian sovereign fund from Singapore and one Arab sovereign fund, hidden to such an extent that even its name was not shared.
It was only the first blow.
In April 2008, things got much worse.
The bank had to announce new billion-dollar losses, and chairman of the board of directors Marcel Ospel, the second highest salary chairman of the board of directors in Switzerland in 2006, resigned.
In October 2008, a disaster occurred. Due to the lack of investment during the financial crisis, UBS was faced with the threat of collapse, and the state had to save it.
The National Bank bought toxic securities from UBS for an unnamed number of billions, and the Swiss Confederation paid six billion Swiss francs for a convertible bond with mandatory conversion to become the bank’s co-owner.
The whole of Switzerland was in shock: the country was aware of the dramatic consequences of the fact that the small country was founded by huge banks.
Ultimately, UBS’s total balance sheet in 2007 was five times higher than the entire production of Switzerland (see schedule).
“We will not be able to save UBS for the second time,” said Geiger, a banking analyst.
The second accident occurred shortly after the first.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with the U.S. and said it was ready to pass on the data of wealthy customers who may have been evading taxes with the bank.
UBS has also agreed to pay <0x24>780 million, consisting of reimbursement of unjustified revenue from business plus a fine.
UBS, therefore, more or less recognized that it was an instrument of tax evasion.
At the same time, UBS has lost what has always been its advantage in the fight for wealthy clients – the veil of secrecy.
After the scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same as before.
The Executive Director and the Chairman of the Board of Directors subsequently resigned, and
The customer’s money has started.
Within a few months, the bank lost confidence in both main areas of its activities - in investment due to failed speculation and in asset management as a result of assistance and promotion of tax evasion.
And just everything calmed down and it seemed that UBS managed to break the situation, as this disaster happened with the affair-trader. One single trader dropped 1.7 billion euros, before the bank noticed that something was wrong.
One thing is clear: risk management in the investment department is not working yet.
“The incident with Adobe clearly showed that risk control has changed insufficiently,” said Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the Swiss Institute of Banking at the University of Zurich.
The financial director of one of Germany’s largest banks also has no doubt: “UBS’s problem is that it does not have a risk control tool.”
For a long time, caution has made Swiss bankers the holders of the world’s largest assets – not an excess risk, but security for money, regardless of whether the world has collapsed outside the Alpine Republic or not.
Swiss bank safes have become a symbol of unmistakable reliability, as Lindt and Sprüngli symbolize the refined taste of chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still corresponds to the image of a decent Swiss private bank, only a little more.
Its atmosphere is a classic in itself.
The bank’s head office is located in Zurich on Banhofstrasse, which leads from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, surrounded by snow caps of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are luxurious, and the rental rates for shops are among the highest in Europe.
Among the traditional Swiss stores such as Confiserie Sprüngli you can find jewelry companies like Tiffany's here.
Swiss banks have been here for hundreds of years – from the National Bank to the Credit Suisse Palace and elite private banks such as Julius Barr.
A heavy door leads to the UBS lobby.
Along the marble-covered walls are large leather sofas. Next to the bank's emblem is a large "safe" indicator.
UBS knows what its customers need – reliability.
But the two largest Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, at some point abandoned Swiss concepts of banking – or, as the head of one of the small Swiss banks assumes, betrayed them.
He would not like to see his name in the newspaper – like all Swiss bankers, he also cooperates with the two largest banks.
He believes that UBS has become too big – in particular, in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons are very active.
In his opinion, the Swiss have nothing to add here.
"And if there is anything, then they have long adapted to Anglo-Saxon customs."
Indeed, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, brought him the first big profits - and then the fiasco. No other European financial institution has lost as much money in the jungle of substandard assets as the largest Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
“On that Wednesday, the ruling coalition of a small country with a population of seven million people undertook the largest rescue operation in the country’s history,” says Lucas Hassig in his book Crack UBS.
Politicians have approved the allocation of 68 billion Swiss francs (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>45 billion) to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How could this have happened?
If you ask the Swiss banks, they will say that the problem is mainly the size of UBS.
Two of the three largest Swiss banks merged into one large group in June 1998.
A bank was formed, which was already too large for small Switzerland at the time of merger, and a bank that continued to grow.
This was also helped by the fact that the two banks that formed UBS complemented each other. One was a wealthy but gradual bank specializing in asset management in Zurich; the other was not so wealthy but much more internationalized.
Internationalized investment bankers all of a sudden gained access to a large amount of money they could use to spin the all-powerful wheel.
Two names are associated with the growth of UBS: Peter Wolffly, UBS Group CEO from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, Chairman of the Board of Directors.
“I always thought that Wolffly and Ospel were the team of dreams,” said Hans Geiger, a banking analyst.
“Wulffly, an outstanding intellectual, modest and deeply understanding of models and statistics, and Ospel with his inner instinct, has gone all the way upwards, starting from an intern at the bank.”
But Ospel eventually relied on Wolffly.
And Wolffly could have made a critical mistake. "He decided that his models were a reality," says Geiger.
"It's tragic."
Maybe it's tragic.
Pride precedes defeat.
UBS employees remember the meetings of board members, at which Wolffly has always repeated the same slogan – to emulate Goldman Sachs.
The U.S. Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
At the time, he was the head of the “tournament table” where the successes of the banks were introduced.
UBS wanted to get to the top of the table.
He was able to make a part of that path.
UBS was the largest player in foreign exchange and government securities trading.
Authorised management consultants, however, pointed to a weakness. By that parameter, which in banking terminology is called "permanent income", UBS was far behind the largest banks.
UBS has failed in U.S. mortgage products.
To close the hole, UBS engaged in an adventure that barely cost him his life.
In an effort to grow, the bank itself and the hedge fund it founded invested in U.S. substandard securities.
This developed into a large mechanism that combined securities based on U.S. mortgage loans and sold them further – continuing to carry risks on its own.
Even when other banks have long been looking for a way out of this process, UBS has not stopped.
“UBS bought until the summer of 2007, when the U.S. real estate market was already on fire,” said Geiger, a banking analyst.
The higher the growth, the deeper the fall.
One manager after the other had to leave as attempts to put the bank in order were harder than it seemed at first.
Posts at UBS have become a children’s game with chairs and remain unreliable to this day.
In front of anyone who leads this huge bank, there is an almost impossible task.
He must find a strategy for the bank that has turned its back on all existing business models.
Geiger’s banking analyst already has the idea of abandoning investment banking, focusing on asset management and forgetting his Swiss roots.
The bank, however, is not (yet) ready to go so far.
However, it is clear that the investment activity needs to be significantly reduced.
The new head of the bank, Sergio Ermotti, plans to present his future strategy on Tuesday.
The 51-year-old Italian-Swiss banker was actually only viewed as a temporary decision when the bank unexpectedly broke up with its predecessor, Grübel.
Over time, he has managed to show character and now, as the Zurich bank said on Tuesday, he leads UBS on a permanent basis.
Ernotty plans to return the investment bank to the state it was in the mid-1990s.
It cuts 3,500 jobs.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a concept of development.
What is UBS?
How does he plan to make money?
These questions must be asked by Axel Weber.
In public, he has so far only said that he and his wife are looking for an apartment in Zurich.
The next year.
The fears of recession in Europe will drag down the U.S. stock exchange
The imminent recession in Europe has deteriorated the mood of U.S. investors at the beginning of the week.
The change of governments in Athens and Rome had little effect.
The decline in industrial production on the continent has silenced the hope that the debt crisis can be overcome in the womb.
The general relief that followed the change of governments in Rome and Athens was not reinforced.
The euro fell compared to the dollar.
Last week, the Italian and Greek glasses were still considered half full, not half empty — but now the problems are getting back to the forefront, Mark Luskini of Janney Mongomery Scott said.
Financial exchanges, in particular, were on sales lists.
The Dow Jones Industrial Index closed at 12,078 with a drop of 0.6 percent.
The market barometer during trading fluctuated between 12,027 and 12,170 points.
The broader S&P 500 index closed at 1251 points, falling by 1%.
The Nasdaq Technology Index lost 0.8 percent by trading at 2,657 points.
In Frankfurt, Dax fell by 1.2 percent, closing at 5985 points.
Industry in 17 euro area countries has significantly reduced production and is adjusting towards the end of growth.
The Eurostat Statistical Service reported that in September, the companies produced two percent less than in the previous month.
This message threw American investors into skepticism. "We're not on the island. We're dependent on them," - said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
He also said that Europe is unlikely to hit a recession quickly and that banks are showing further signs of weakness.
Legendary investor Warren Buffett was only able to affirm these concerns. In an interview with CNBC, he said it is still unclear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything it takes to end the crisis.
Therefore, he believes it is too early to invest in European government bonds or in banks.
Instead, Buffett dumped into the garbage bin the principle that lasted more than a decade and invested in the American high-tech industry.
His more than <0x24>10 billion investment in IBM raised the stock price of the oldest company by almost 1% against the trend.
The shares closed, almost unchanged, at the level of <0x24>187.35.
Buffett said he paid an average of <0x24>170 per share and now has a share of 5.5 percent.
The stock price of his investment firm Berkshire Hathway fell by 1.3 percent.
Bank of America’s shares fell by 2.6 percent, much stronger than the market.
The bank converted almost all of its remaining share of the Building Bank of China into cash, earning <0x24>6.6 billion.
The bank primarily plans to support its share capital with net sales profits in order to comply with more stringent standards.
Aircraft manufacturer Boeing won, shortening the losses on Dow-Jones.
The stock price rose by 1.5 percent after the corporation received the largest order in its history.
On Sunday, the airline Emirates ordered 50 777 series long-haul aircraft for a total value of <0x24>18 billion.
Including the option to buy another 20 aircraft, a total of in fact <0x24>26 billion.
Approximately 710 million shares were exchanged for the owner of the New York Stock Exchange.
The shares of 719 companies grew, 2281 fell and 79 remained at the same level.
The shares of 630 companies ended the trades with growth, a fall in 1913 and 82 remained at the same level on Nasdaq with a turnover of 1.38 billion shares.
Thoughtful warriors fill the cities
Players are considered problematic birds in many places. Experts today say that these very smart birds will no longer be able to be expelled from the cities.
Some like birds, others would like to get rid of them as quickly as possible. Warriors have been part of the urban landscape for centuries, but residents complaining of dirt and noise, in many settlements are becoming more and more.
The solution to the problem of birds, however, has not yet been achieved.
At the first symposium, dedicated to predators, in the town of Ler in East Friesland, experts argued that it was no longer possible for the gamers to be expelled from the cities.
Experts from all over Germany have discussed possible solutions.
Finding Alternatives in Cities
Conservationists argued that the root of the problem in cities was the migration of specially protected grasshoppers, indicating that the use of chemicals in agriculture has increasingly destroyed traditional habitat areas.
Hunting, expanding construction and cutting of traditional trees for nestling made life difficult for birds.
The robbers are under guard.
The city of Zest in Westphalia and in the northwest of Jever, Dipholce, Ahime under Bremen and Lere are large colonies, with more than 600 parent pairs.
The ambiguous project of shooting warriors in Lare caused disapproving newspaper headlines in 2005.
Critics described catching birds in traps and stabbing them with sticks as a particular cruelty.
"Normal movement and intimidation don't give anything," said architect and landscape designer Werner Clever from Lera.
Breaking down water jets or tree strands often have undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lara, Baden-Württemberg.
“Animals are dispersed, and large colonies are divided and spread to other areas.”
The intimidation is possible only in the form of an exception near hospitals, homes of the elderly and schools.
"We have to live with them. Getting rid of them is not an option."
Unlike the surrounding areas, the problem in the cities will not be solved, says Mayor Lera Wolfgang Kölner.
A combination of discouraging birds from those in need of shelter and encouraging them to return to other areas could be a way out.
"Information stands instead of benzopil" was a slogan proposed by psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jurgens, who advocates a completely different approach to birds. "We need to be confident in living with this problem."
Jurgens was one of the founders of the educational rout in Ascherberg in Schleswig-Holstein, where information stands provide information about the lives of highly thoughtful players.
The project is already of interest to tourists.
Jurgens also expressed her opinion about complaints about noise produced by birds. "The noise transmits a lot of information. They have a lot to say to each other."
The mind and the whispering of these birds have become legends. Players often not only use the weapons to capture the spotted piece, but also make the weapons themselves.
Behavioral researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested a bird's mind measure on four toys.
In one experiment, the birds quickly realized that it was necessary to feed on a plate to obtain a larvae of moly.
Without special training, they recognized the size and shape of the stone needed to knock down the plate.
In another experiment, smart gadgets had to solve a more complex task.
The researchers put a small rope with a mole larvae in a vertical cylinder.
Birds were unable to get their livestock.
But researchers gave them pieces of wires.
All four birds used the wire to make hooks and used hooks to tie the handle to the handle and pull it out of the cylinder.
Three of the four players managed this from the first attempt.
Ronaldo draws Portugal for Euro 2012
The hopes of Bosnians and Turks for a last minute victory were long gone.
Favorites of Portugal, Croatia and the Czech Republic, plus Ireland, will participate in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland took last place in the Euro 2012 championships in Poland and Ukraine.
Under the superstar Cristiano Ronaldo, who scored 8 and 53 minutes, Portugal beat Bosnia and Herzegovina with a score of 6:2 (2:1), perfecting their fifth Euro outing after 0:0 in the first stage.
The Czechs had enough 1:0 (0:0) in the second round of play-offs against outsider Montenegro after a clean win in the first round (2:0).
Croatia did not lose their chance by playing 0–0 against Turkey, and Ireland easily scored 1–1 (1–0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th minute), Nelder Postiga (72th and 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the remaining goals for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburger Bundesliga professional Zvezdan Misimovi<0xC4><0x87> and captain Emir Spahi<0xC4><0x8D> reduced the difference by two points thanks to a successful penalty in the 41st minute and a goal in the 65th for Bosnia.
Sena Lulich received a second yellow card in the 54th minute.
Portugal has already kicked Bosnia out of the playoffs of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
Portugal made a great start at Lisbon’s Estadio da Luz.
Ronaldo took an early start, putting a free kick in the gate from about 30 meters.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani demonstrated his long-distance abilities, with a 25-meter mark increasing the score to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did not open the account in the first half hour, got their first chance thanks to the attacking Edna Jacko.
A former Wolfsburg player from the England championship leader Manchester City sent the headball to the bottom of the stick in the 33rd minute, but the ball did not cross the goal line.
Yira<0xC4><0x8D>ek plays for the Czech Republic
Later, Judge Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding was at the center of attention.
Following the attack on Elder Postiga at the Bosnian penalty area in the 36th minute, Stark decided that the Portuguese player had simulated and showed him a yellow card.
Stark also awarded dubious penalties for hand-playing after Fola Fabiu Kuentran - Misimovich implemented it.
After the 2004 European vice-championship break, they scored another four goals.
Peter Yira<0xC4><0x8D>ek cleared all remaining doubts about the Czechs in the 81st minute.
The 1976 European Championships will be sent to the European Championships for the fifth time in a row.
The good luck was also smiling to the team of coach Mikhail Bilek and the Bundesliga legionaries Mikhail Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Thomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg) after a mistake in the very beginning that could be catastrophic.
The goalkeeper Petr Chekh in the 9th minute, thanks to the instant reflex, prevented the potential autogoal of Tomash Sivok.
Montenegro’s best chances were when the duo of Stefan Yovetic and Dian Damyanovich were on the field.
Damyanovich hit the end of the penalty area in the 40th minute and barely scored a goal for the Czech Republic.
After a break of the squad, she saved the already beaten world-class Czech goalkeeper after FC Seoul's forward left the field in the 50th minute.
The winning goal was scored just before the final whistle.
Turkey, meanwhile, was lacking in football happiness in Zagreb.
Four days after losing 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks could not play better than a 0-0 defeat in Zagreb.
Although there is virtually no doubt now that coach Gus Hiddink will now free a place on the bench of the team, which reached third place in 2002, the Croatians are in the final round of the European Championship for the fourth time.
The Turks almost perfectly managed to start in the eyes of 31,000 spectators at the stadium Maximir.
Seljuk Inan's long-hit in the seventh minute hit the stand, and the attacking Kazym Kazym failed to throw the ball into the net.
Croatia has since woken up and has gained more and more control over the game.
After the break, the Croatians continued the game in excellent form.
The Bundesliga Legionaries Daniel Pranic (Bavarian, Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Aintracht, Frankfurt) were on the field with Mario Manjukic of the Wolfsburg team, who gave up the place of Ivan Perishich from Dortmund for 62 minutes.
Trapattoni is heading for Euro-2012.
The Irish in Dublin celebrated their first Euro appearance after Germany in 1988.
The team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni – who already looked confident in his place after a 4:0 win in the first stage – took the lead in the 32nd minute thanks to the goal of Steven Ward.
Konstantin Vasilyev from the guest team compared the score at the 57th minute.
Ireland took a good pace from the start, but only in the 23rd minute Robbie Kin from Los Angeles made his first clean headshot.
At the last moment, the Estonian defender managed to prevent him from pushing Ireland forward.
The goal was scored in the 32nd minute.
Bypassing defender Pavel Londak, Ward was in the right place and, dropping the ball across the line, changed the score to 1-0.

SAP plans to double the number of employees in China
The largest software manufacturer in Europe, SAP, plans to invest billions and almost double the number of its employees in China in the next few years.
The Dax-listed company said on Thursday it plans to invest about <0x24>2 billion (about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.5 billion) by 2015.
“We will create more research and development opportunities and employ thousands of people,” said Bill McDermott, one of SAP’s executive directors, at the Consumer Exhibition in Beijing.
A state of 2,500 people should grow to 4,500.
The global market leader in industrial software plans to double the number of its offices from five to ten or eleven.
SAP now has offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chendu and Dalian.
This country, which is experiencing an economic boom, has about 4,000 SAP customers from more than 176,000 worldwide.
China’s growth forecast is an important component of the company’s 2015 strategy, which is part of the Dax listing.
SAP plans to increase its turnover to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 billion by 2015.
Last year, the company from Waldorf earned about 12.5 billion euros.
The software vendor business, with 55,000 employees worldwide, looks better than ever before.
SAP has been in China for 20 years.
“Now we want to change the scale of our operations,” McDermott said.
“Our goal is to achieve sustainable growth, based on information technology in China.”
Mass murders are a human dimension.
Peter Englund’s exciting and very good new book, Beauty and Sadness: A Personal History of the First World War, begins with a long list of active people from whom the heart is sore.
Here’s a tip to continue reading: carefully cut this page and use it as a bookmark.
You’ll get to know these people very closely as Mr. England tells the story, and this list of active persons will be your GPS, your flashlight at the moments when, like one of these men and women, you’ll get off the road and get lost in the fog of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
The book he wrote now is unusual, he describes it, quite precisely, as "the work of anti-history".
It contains little known names, important treaties or famous battles; there are hardly any ambassadors, hunting journalists or discussions of tactics and combat equipment.
It's not so much a book about what was, he explains, as a book about what it looked like, it's about "feelings, impressions, experiences, and the state of the spirit."
The book “Beauty and Sadness” brings together the experience of the war years of 20 more or less unprecedented men and women, on both sides of the front line, from schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and staff.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Someone gets trapped, loses a hand or a leg, gets mad or dies.
Their lives are melted here like church candles: new ones are added to many others, and some at this time will be extinguished.
Mr. Englund's book is a departure from the standard of historical books.
This is also an amendment to the idea that the First World War was only a severe guerrilla war on the Western Front.
"Beauty and Sadness" skilfully gives a panorama of other war theaters: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
A soldier in this book falls beehives; one of them meets Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the unresolved problem is the tschetsky flies.
It’s an exciting book, almost from the beginning.
War covers the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina, smelling smokeless dust.
When you hear cannon near, and you are a woman and you are at home with children, will you stay in place or escape?
Either way, who's going through it?
Almost no one understands what’s going on and why you should fight in this war.
"The lack of facts," says Mr. Englund, "is filled with guesses, assumptions, hopes, fears, obsessive ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beauty and Sadness" follows the fate of such people as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young naval officer in the German Offshore Fleet.
Their stories are taken mainly from memoirs, letters and other materials already published.
Stories about their lives can be scary or exciting, but they are highly alive thanks to the small moments and fragments that Mr. England has collected.
Many of them are about deprivations and how to deal with them.
Telling the story of a German schoolgirl, he says, "Erzaz, Erzaz everywhere."
"Replacement coffee, fake aluminum, non-real rubber, paper ties, wooden buttons."
He continues to talk about Erzz-Food in Germany.
He describes “meat from pressed rice, boiled in lamb fat (and decorated with a fake bone made of wood); tobacco made of dried roots and dried potato skin; shoes, bent with wood.”
He noted that there were "837 registered meat substitutes allowed in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories tell us about honor and courage.
One American notes in himself a craving for cruelty and says of the war: "You feel that, in the end, it's what men were created for, not to sit in comfortable chairs with a cigarette and a whiskey dish."
The British soldier, on the contrary, notes that he is likely to die and that no one will notice or be sad.
“When a person humbles himself with the thought of self-sacrifice, he would like to think that it will happen in front of the public,” he writes.
But it’s the opposite, terribly similar to “a convicted man who is secretly hanged.”
Other remarks concern the old Europe, which is falling apart, and new kinds of fear.
“Conflict has become more and more economic competition,” writes Mr. Englund, “the war of factories.”
He notes the arrival of the one he calls “a new species in the beetle of the beginning of the century: a beautifully expressive and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a well-sewn suit that fits the cut while sitting at a desk.”
Humans act in an unpredictable way: lower actions are as much as heroism.
Mr. Englund spoke about the soldiers who tried in every way to suppress the venereal disease from the prostitutes in order to avoid service on the front.
“The most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade of gonorrhea pomegranate, which the soldiers bought and shaved at their genitals in hopes of getting to the hospital,” he wrote.
"All the despairs were sweeping him in the eyes, which often led to lifelong blindness."
Translated from Swedish by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund's prose is flexible, but unbroken, perfectly suited to his humanitarian task.
In dozens of small scenes, he shows how the war "liberated completely uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are forcing them to fight.
The best books about World War I were often indirect, such as "The Great War and the Modern Memory" by Paul Fassel or such novels as "On the Western Front Unchanged" by Erich-Marie Remarque, rather than exhaustive historical works.
Mr. England's book is part of this unprecedented pantheon.
His book has the most amazing finale I can remember in non-artistic literature.
I'm not gonna tell him.
But it's as if he reached out from the book to a page with a list of characters, took it out of your hands and burned it with a spike.
After the previous error - a carefully calculated raid
Hundreds of police officers, some in protective helmets, were involved in the operation.
The clocks from Monday to Tuesday were chosen because there were the fewest people in Zukotti Park at this time.
The operation was kept secret from all but a few high-ranking officers, the rest were told at first that they were going to the exercises.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the center of the event, his presence underscored the importance given to the Police Department's operations.
There could be no talk of repeating such episodes in recent weeks as the use of cross-border gas against protesters, which violated the rules of the department and caused a hurricane of public sympathy to the occupiers.
So, after two weeks of planning and training, a police operation to liberate protesters from Zukotti Park began.
The authorities were preparing to watch the occupations in other cities evolve.
The largest anti-crisis exercises were conducted on the island of Randels with a calculation on Zukotti.
The authorities have increased the number of so-called trainings in the event of unrest - counter-terrorism measures that provide for the rapid movement of large numbers of police officers - in the light of Lower Manhattan.
The last training was held on Monday evening on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to enter the park came in the "last minute", - said a source familiar with the orders, in which the task was mentioned only as "training".
“The few cops I know and called on to this case did not say they were being sent to Zukotti Park,” said the man, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
“The only ones who knew they were going to Zukotti Park were at the highest positions in the department.”
One of the reasons for secrecy was the lesson that the city learned.
On October 14, the authorities wanted to clear the park, but retreated to the hundreds of protesters who sneaked inside before the deadline to hear about the plans.
The operation was carried out on Tuesday by employees of various police units, including forces from the districts - police teams, which were usually used to control the criminal surroundings.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, almost like at work, come and leave the park during the day, making 1 hour of the night a suitable time for the attack.
“It was right to do this when the park is the least populous,” he said.
Rescue vehicles with projectors and loudspeakers gathered at Pike-Slip and Franklin Roosevelt Drive, near Manhattan Bridge, before moving forward.
The projector and pre-recorded announcements from speakers seem to have frightened many protesters.
When the officers of the administrative units entered the park in their blue winds, many protesters simply collected their belongings and left.
Police said the tents did not touch until 1:45 p.m., giving protesters time to assemble.
Other groups of police, according to eyewitnesses, gathered around the perimeter to enter in case arrests are needed in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Brown, a spokesman for the Department of Police, said it was done for their safety.
But many journalists claim that they were not allowed to see how the police operate, and that the police treated them harshly.
Mr. Brown said that cars with cameras on Church Street, along the western boundary of the park, could have taken a picture.
When the police went west through the chest of protesters’ personal belongings, including bags, plastic rugs and plastic bags, full clothes, the Sanitary Department teams followed her, collecting what was thrown.
Some protesters, who refused to leave, pulled out, photographs of this soon appeared on the Internet.
The main group of protesters took positions near the kitchen camp, near the center of the park.
Some built barricades, and the police went inside, methodically arresting them.
About 10 people at the camp's epicenter held their hands together.
And two people clinging to the trees, Mr. Kelly said.
To cut the locks, the rescuers were called.
No arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The cleaning operation was completed in about 75 minutes, police said.
Mr. Brown said about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most were arrested for “violation of public order and resistance in detention,” he said.
The highest-ranking officer on the spot was Joseph J. Esposito, head of the department and senior officer in the department.
Phil. T. Pulaski, the head of the department's sheriff's police, was there too.
Mr. Kelly, although present, "didn't lead the operation," said Mr. Brown.
The second group of police were waiting along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Sidar Street, in case you had to enter.
The barriers were placed on Courtland Street, in the neighborhood north of the park, and on Pine Street, in the neighborhood south.
Observers saw the police extending the perimeter even further beyond the borders of Zukotti Park from these positions.
At one point, observers saw a group of police officers, many with shields, pushing people further.
About 28 people were on the northern perimeter.
Some of the most serious events of the night occurred south of the park.
At about 5 a.m. south of Pine Street, one of the protesters jumped on the roof of the police car, and others, according to eyewitnesses, released air from the tyres of the police van.
At one point, a piece of funnel flew out of the crowd.
As a result, one policeman and one of the protesters were hospitalized.
Union of School Service Personnel to Appeal to City for Dismissal
The union, representing hundreds of school service staff who lost their seats last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming that dismissals were unnecessary and discriminatory due to the disproportionate impact on schools where poor scholars are studying.
Proceedings are probably the last means available to the trade union of the District Council 37, seeking to cancel the dismissal.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, a co-ordinator for working with parents and other employees who were among the lowest-paid workers in the city, lost their seats on October 7th, as a result of the medical profession, which the leaders of the union called their political reaction.
City officials have categorically rejected the accusation.
At the hearings at the City Council last month, school Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said the dismissals were part of the budget they signed in June.
One of the members of the board paried, telling him that there was no indication in the budget that auxiliary school staff would be fired.
Representatives of 37 district councils reported that they had appealed to the Department of Education to warn it was being filed; a press conference will be held on Wednesday to announce a formal filing of the suit at the High Court of the State in Manhattan.
The suit will include Mr. Walcott and the Department of Education of the City as respondents and list eight temporarily fired workers as plaintiffs, all black or Latin American women, as well as most assistants who have lost their seats.
Elizabeth Thomas, a representative of the city’s legal department, said the city had not seen a lawsuit and could therefore not comment on its specific provisions.
In accordance with the preliminary version of the complaint available to the New York Times, the union focused on a number of dismissals in schools in poor areas of the city to support the claim that they are being treated unfairly, claiming that the poor are more educated.
He pointed out that while there were no layoffs in Staten Island, but there were few in the schools of Upper East Side or Tribeca, 17 auxiliary school workers lost seats in 23 districts in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 had to leave in 9 counties and 8 districts.
Noting the loss of five of the eight school assistants who worked at Free High School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the claim reads, “These are not areas of wealthy parents who can find money to fill budget gaps.”
P.S. Budget 36 was cut by 3.26% this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way to calculate additional funding for every poor student who goes to school.
The union also argues that the school directors could have been misled by the language of the notification authorizing the dismissal of parents coordinators.
The notice used the word "exaggeration", although "exaggeration" is more often said when a teacher moves from the school's payroll to a list of existing employees, whose salaries are paid by the central office.
“Sixty-six coordinators working with their parents were fired,” the lawsuit said, “and not just translated.”
Mission finished, Congress ready to agree on Libya <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
It seems that Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill are finally ready to agree on something relevant to the uprising in Libya.
All it took was for the rebellion to succeed, long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi to be captured and killed, and the American intervention ended.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee will consider a resolution drafted by President John Kerry (Democrat, Massachusetts) together with Senators John McCain (Republican, Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent, Horne).
“The purpose of this resolution is to pay tribute to the courageous people of Libya when they begin to restore their country,” Kerry said.
"This is an affirmation of their support for the democratic aspirations of both parties."
The language may seem harmless, but no discussion about Libya has yet been easy.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties discussed with each other and with the White House the formulation of a series of resolutions endorsing or condemning the role of the U.S. military in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution allowing the limited use of U.S. armed forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected by the House of Representatives by a significant majority of both parties and did not reach a vote in the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill failed in the House of Representatives, the House also did not support a proposal that would cut funding for the U.S. operation in Libya.
This has left the American mission in some sort of legislative purge—when Congress is angry enough to criticize Obama’s approach to the mission, but not so angry enough to actually kick the ground out of her legs.
Events then reversed the indecision of Congress.
In August Tripoli surrendered to Libyan rebels, and on October 20 Gaddafi was killed.
NATO’s mission was officially completed on October 31.
Now the Senate can be ready for action.
The Foreign Affairs Committee’s resolution “admires the Libyan people for their incredible bravery and extraordinary resilience in the pursuit of freedom” and thankes the men and women of the United States Armed Forces for their non-coalition partners’ efforts to protect their people.”
The resolution also “affirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya.”
Will the new measures receive full support from the Foreign Affairs Council, or will they split the legislators, like the June bill?
The latter version was opposed by Senator Richard G. Luger, the leader of the Republicans in the Committee.
Luger’s spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the latest version of the bill.
On the other hand, the Capitol of the House of Representatives should vote this week for a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, the main legislative priority for almost every Republican and for some Democrats in Congress.
The measure proposed by the House of Representatives by Bob Goodlaat (Republican, Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or anything else that will be put to the plenary vote of the Congress of this summit.
Other legislators have not yet been able to make their amendments to the plenary meeting, but not because they have not tried.
The Goodlat amendment is just one of the 68 constitutional amendments that concern a wide range of issues that have been introduced in this summit.
Some were duplicated - the same bill was introduced in the House of Representatives and in the Senate - others were minor variations of one another.
There are at least 15 versions of the amendments on the balanced budget only in the House of Representatives and some more on "control over federal spending".
Some of them are also identical, but give their authors – mostly newly elected Republicans who want to decorate their CVs – the opportunity to boast that they have “opened” such an offer.
The Budget Control Act, which was passed in August, required both the House of Representatives and the Senate to vote in favour of an amendment to the balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, some congressmen want to limit the term of office of members of Congress, and House of Representatives José Serrano (Democrat, New York) wants to repeal the term of two for the president.
Congressman Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat, Illinois) proposed a number of amendments that guarantee, among other things, the right to quality education and health care.
An amendment banning same-sex marriage has been proposed for many years, as well as another amendment banning the burning of the flag.
Some legislators also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if two-thirds of the states object to them.
Although members of Congress have sought to propose amendments, they are progressing no faster than in the past years.
In the 111th Congressional convocation, the legislators proposed 77 such amendments, and in the 110th, 66.
This rate will decline compared to the early 1990s, when members of Congress, according to the Senate Library, regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years.
But they were not more successful than they are now.
The last amendment, the 27th, was approved in 1992, but was introduced to Congress in 1789.
"Populate, but not defeated," Giffords said in his first television interview after the assassination.
Ten months after an armed man shot at her at a public event in Tucson, a member of the House of Representatives Gabriel Giffords (Democratic Party, Arizona) said on Monday night that Conrad was more likely to appear on the federal channel, "singing a song".
Appearing on the 20/20 program of ABC News with Diane Sawyer, Giffords hardly formulated proposals and needed help walking.
The program showed her difficult recovery path after a bullet that smashed the skull and pierced the left side of the brain, passing from the front to the back of the head.
Three months later, she unexpectedly returned to the House of Representatives and voted triumphantly on the bill on limit debt.
In her first television interview after the January shooting, in which six people were killed and 13 wounded, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang — and called her recovery “difficult.”
Asked how she feels, 41-year-old Giffords replied, "Very good."
The interview with Gifffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of the hourly special edition "20/20", which was shown on the eve of the new Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope.
The Special Release reported the restoration of the Giffords after the shooting on January 8.
In a video taken by Kelly in the first few weeks, she is lying on a hospital bed with a broken head and a long scar on her forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers at her husband’s request.
A few months later, we see Giffords sitting in a wheelchair, and physiotherapists teach her how to perform simple actions.
Squeeze your head.
Pull your lips.
And then her first word: "What?"
A few days later, Giffords said the second word - "toast", a request to change the breakfast menu.
The video, shown by the BBC, demonstrates that music played a central role in the recovery of Giffords: we see a congressman singing along with the doctors "Girls just want to have fun" by Cindy Loper and "Free Fall" by Tom Petty.
In an interview, Sawyer Giffords, who spends two hours a day on procedures, said she could not remember the day of the assassination.
Her husband said he had read Giffford's article in the newspaper about the March 12 shooting, when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who were killed at the time.
The suspected attacker, Jerd Lee Laffner, is in Missouri prison and undergoes coercive treatment pending trial.
“A lot of people have died,” said Giffords Sawyer.
"Heavy, heavy, heavy."
One day during her recovery, Kelly Sawyer said, she said, "I'm defeated."
"And I said, 'Gabby, you're not defeated,'" Kelly said.
You're just being beaten.
And you're going through it, you're going to get better and come back stronger than ever.
The military feels more regret than respect.
The event was a holiday on Wall Street, which raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, disappointment, and loss.
According to the signal, several hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines built around it.
The audience in the smokinetics applauded him standing up.
“The soldiers were seen as heroes,” said David Salzman, who organized the spring fundraising.
The senior military officer at the concert, at which was also the then chairman of the Committee of Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Millen, saw the role of the troops in a different way.
“They were treated like orphans,” the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers wanted the best.
I know that.
But it wasn't really respect, it was regret.
The very opposite impressions illustrate the difficult relationships that have been established between the army and the often indifferent, sometimes admired American public.
Soldiers are being praised for their sacrifices.
But praise has its price, the military says.
The audience behaves more and more like they feel sorry for people in shape.
"We are not victims at all," Brigadier General Sean B. McFarland, who was in command of the troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan, said.
“But it seems that the only way for some to show support is to treat us as if we were unhappy.”
This is a sensitive topic for military leaders who don’t want to look ingrate or disagree with the society they serve.
They also realize that the anger faced by the returning troops in the last years of the Vietnam War was much worse.
As a result, most conversations about grief take place quietly and only between combat veterans.
After two of his sons returned from combat in the Marine Corps, retired colonel Mark Kenshen warned them that non-military men would look at their service from two points of view.
Some will look at them with admiration because they have crushed the rebels and have been in exotic places.
Others will wonder if "under the mask is a cruel evil veteran," said Kenshen, who fought in Iraq and, returning, took a senior government position in Washington.
While looking for a job, he says, he felt that some interviewers had asked carefully if he would be able to withstand the tensions of responsible work in Washington immediately after the campaign.
Kenshen recalls how he told his sons, "When you talk about your service, you have to count on the negative effect."
The inconvenience experienced by the military is partly due to American indifference to wars.
Victories on the battlefield are rarely praised by a country that is little familiar with the army and sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“As a nation, we no longer value military heroism as it used to be in World War II,” said resigned Lieutenant General David Burnout, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the admiration of politicians and the public focuses mainly on the depth of the suffering of the soldier.
The military estimates the number of campaigns they have undertaken, the number of comrades they have lost, or the scale of the losses.
The Army is facing increasing pressure from supporters of the fight against rape
This week’s historic hearings will have to decide whether 28 men and women will be sued against the army on charges of non-violence.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs will be placed in line with the following.
First-class female Elizabeth Lyman, 25, was allegedly raped by her accomplice at night at the age of 11 weeks of pregnancy.
It was in October 2008, she was returning to her barracks at Miramar Airport, north of San Diego after dinner with a friend, and she met a servant-man carrying a pack of 12 bottles of beer.
He asked if he could go to her room for a drink.
"It was a red flag," says Lyman.
But the native of Texas has given up her fears.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I'm sorry I didn't listen to my instincts at the time."
A few minutes after they entered the Lyman room, the man approached her from behind, fell and raped, she claims.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel will be eagerly awaiting the judgment of the court at a historic hearing that will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and that will be decided by Roosevelt and his predecessor, Roosevelt, who will decide whether or not to go to court with the lawsuit they have filed.
The lawsuit claims that Gates and Ramsfeld were unable to cope with widespread violence in the army in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The lawsuit filed in February by Lawyer Susan Burke of Washington, D.C. initially included 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months – 25 women and three men, all of whom claim that they were not prosecuted or threatened by rape, sexual abuse or co-violation.
Burke says she has been targeting senior officers in the army because the problem starts with them.
“The army is a vertical structure,” she says.
"Who are the people who can eradicate the cult of violence?
Burke also says that since February, about 400 other victims have been contacted, many of whom may participate in future lawsuits.
Her strategy: instead of collecting all the plaintiffs in this case - putting all the eggs in one basket, so to speak - she will open a lot of cases if needed to maintain the pressure.
The defense team from the Department of Defense, led by federal prosecutor Neil McBride, has taken steps to terminate the case.
The court documents received by Newsweek reveal a defense strategy – mainly that former or current soldiers cannot file an army claim for damages inflicted by the armed forces.
According to the doctrine named in the 1950 Supreme Court ruling by the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for the damage caused by persons in military service.
“The alleged damage relates to the risk present to the military service of the plaintiffs,” the documents said.
The Ministry of Defence declined to comment on this story.
Since the 1950s, the situation has changed.
Although women are still officially forbidden to participate in the battle, this division exists only in words: modern wars rarely have a clear front line.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, women-soldier teams play an increasingly important role, especially in contacts with local women in the fighting zone.
The result: between the two wars, 150 women-soldiers died - two-thirds of them in combat.
It’s time for the military to become modern, Burke says.
She is not alone in her struggle; in addition to her quest, three others are being prepared.
At the Yale School of Law, the Veterans’ Law Service Seminar is preparing a case against the four largest military academies on charges of promoting a women’s-professional atmosphere.
A separate non-profit association of American war veterans in Vietnam is preparing a lawsuit against an army, at the center of which the diagnosis of “personality change” is made to be victims of violence to remove them from service, is a common phenomenon, according to the law-abiding organizations, such as activists.
Her group filed a lawsuit against the Veterans Office in December, accusing him of discriminatory treatment of pensions from people who claim to have been threatened with sexual violence during service.
Nine separate bills proposing a number of measures were introduced to Congress by a group of senators and members of the House of Representatives from both parties.
In 2010, according to the Department of Sexual Violence Prevention and Combating, 3,158 attempted rape were reported.
But, as is known, the attacks are often not reported, and according to the Pentagon's own estimates, this figure accounts for approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also investigates the percentage of cases: in 2010, 20 per cent of known cases were brought to justice — twice as low as in the civil justice system.
Burke's prosecutors call them only the first in a series of other injuries.
In the case of Lyman, she reported rape to the military police less than an hour after it happened.
That night, she said, she was asked to tell details of the rape separately 11 times a fiancee of police, doctors and commanders.
She collected a set of evidence of rape, and the blood of the attacker - from the cut on her hand - was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman sat before the judge at a hearing during which she was asked if she had sex with her friend earlier on the day of the attack.
Six people gave a positive characteristic to the accused, which was ultimately justified.
“I remember the day the verdict was read,” Lyman says.
"I thought I was having a baby right now - I ran out of the courtroom with a scream."
"They put me in a psychiatric ward, and when I came out, I remember my commander saying, 'This was not a trial for him, it was a trial for me.'
Lyman was ordered to turn to a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a change of personality, which made her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed with an unfavorable wording, which did not allow her to receive any benefits.
Whether the case put forward by Lyman and her comrades on the lawsuit is going to be a difficult question, says John Terley, a professor of law at the George Washington University law school.
However, he notes: "In my opinion, they are in a position to move forward."
Between them and the verdict stands a doctrine that has been criticized since it emerged.
I've been criticizing the Persian Doctrine all my life.
The army has been delayed for decades because it does not have the incentives and deterrence it imposes on it.
He adds: “The odds are largely against them ... but it’s important for them to try.”
These things will only change when decent people want to fight.
If the hearing is not in their favor, Burke, the plaintiff's lawyer, will gather hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
“We will continue to fight with the army on this issue until there is a reform,” she said.
Or until we die, depending on what's going to happen before.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Study You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Bering Bravewick was an ordinary guy who exposed his anti-immigration views on the internet.
On Monday, Bravik, who confessed to a mass murder in Norway in July that killed 77 people, appeared at his first open trial.
Although Breivik could act alone, he was far from alone on the net: he spent a lot of time preparing to attack his computer, communicating with millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social networks.
After the summer tragedy, researchers wanted to learn more about these people.
But how to find them?
It's easy - you just have to go to Facebook.
“We realized it’s not hard to get to them,” says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of the recently published report on European cyber populism at the British Research Centre DEMOS.
The stock of personal data on Facebook is so big, says Bartlett, that researchers could easily use the site’s advertising tool to highlight the necessary demographics with scientific accuracy – which marketers have been doing for several years.
Bartlett’s team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then placed an advertisement for them, but instead of showing a new group or diet product, the advertisement offered the user to go through a survey with questions about the level of their education, their attitude to violence and their own rejection.
With the help of Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 participants of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries – not even leaving the office.
“This is a completely new way to conduct research,” says Bartlett.
Some results are not so surprising: online supporters of right-wing groups are mostly young men who are dissatisfied with immigration.
But suddenly, “those who combine their online activity with offline activity are more intelligent, more democratic, and less aggressive than those who just hide behind the monitor.”
The DEMOS work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new popular tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers, and politicians use the site to study everything in the world – from health issues to social trends that are expressed in ‘lights’, wall posts, and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three posts a day, Facebook’s “super-recent information” is sparking a research boom, increasing the number of scientific articles titled the site by 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it gives you the opportunity to study people who can’t approach on the street with a notebook.
“Earlier, if you wanted to interview people from the British National Party, it would be very difficult to identify them.”
“You would have to join the party and they would never have accepted you,” Bartlett said.
“Facebook excludes all of this – you’re addressing them directly.”
Others say that with the help of this site it would be possible to identify and investigate social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Meghan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and colleagues found that students who discussed their drunk feats on Facebook were significantly more at risk of alcoholism than students who were silent about it.
Moreno suggests that fellow students, such as their dormitory mentors, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who too often updates drunk statuses.
“You can’t solve the problem without identifying it,” said Washington Post’s Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Moreno and director of the Center for Children’s Health, Behavior and Development at the Seattle Children’s Research Institute.
“We found a way to identify children from the risk group who otherwise would not have been detected.”
Facebook also continuously retrieves various types of data about its users.
The data processing team of the site processed statistics of the relationship status and Valentine's Day, the election of voters in mid-term in 2010, as well as the National Index of Happiness (mainly using information, to which the website should be accessed only by them, - the champions of cyber-freedom.
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not – in exchange for the opportunity to play Scrabble with a friend located thousands of miles away, the site can process your personal data.
But what if Facebook users become participants in a research they don’t even know about?
While researchers have strictly defined standards for conducting offline research, online data is publicly available.
“I don’t think many users have at least thought about what a researcher can look at their profiles,” says Neil Selvin, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, about a study he conducted in 2006 using public-access student pages on Facebook.
“As far as they could have imagined, it was only between them and their friends.”
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that the research object is extremely honest.
It is not possible on Facebook to know how much information in the profile and on the user’s page is true.
“What you’re saying on Facebook and what you’re doing outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” Selvin says.
That’s why, despite years of technology research, Selvin thinks that a notebook and a pen are still the best research tools that can be used.
“Nothing can replace the way out into the real world and communication with real people,” he says.
“Social research is supposed to be about social, and most of social is still happening offline.”
Cold and Inhuman: Anders Bering Bravewick to appear in court for the first time
Anders Bering Bravik, a man who confessed to organizing a double attack that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance fighter" during his first public appearance in a court in Oslo.
"I am the military commander of the Norwegian Resistance Movement and the Knights of the Templars of Norway," he said before 500 people in the courtroom.
“I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism.”
“I admit actions, but I don’t admit guilt.”
Judge Torkiel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "didn't want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform for expressing his own views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who brought with him a pre-written speech, to address the relatives of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, banned him from accessing the media for four weeks, and said the authorities would take strict control of all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
Approximately 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some have come to see Breivik in the eye, others to make sure it is contained under the lock.
Everyone came to find answers to their questions.
"I thought it looked cold and inhumane," one of the survivors told NRK in Utah.
“It was uncomfortable, but personally it was a little easier for me after I saw and heard the suspect.”
Bravewick, wearing a dark suit and blue strap, kept calm and professionalism throughout the hearing and looked in the eyes of journalists and survivors as he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik’s strange idea that he was part of a large “resistance” movement, the judge ruled that he was not crazy, and said there was no evidence that he was acting with his comrades.
Some may reassure that the July 22 attacks appear to be the work of one extremist, not a group of radicals.
But this does not automatically diminish the pain and discomfort that the entire nation now feels.
“I would like him to look like a monster, but that’s not true,” a relative of one of the victims said.
“It would be much easier if it were so.”
7 Lessons from Steve Jobs’ Lost Interview Shown at Theatre This Week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, describing technical genius as the Great Inventor of Modernity.
But what Apple fans might consider to be the biggest discovery in a newly-discovered interview, which they recalled earlier this week’s previews on major markets, is how much this creative mind understood in business processes and manufacturing technologies.
He was, of course, a designer, a dreamer, and considered himself a hippie, but he was also a keen organizer and modernizer of the production process, who believed that many business leaders suffered from the “disease to think that the really great idea of the work is 90 percent of the work and the great idea of the product.”
Back in 1995, Bob Cringley created the TV series Triumph Nerds about the emergence of a personal computer, and he spent more than an hour with Jobs for a unique long conversation.
It’s been about 10 years since Jobs was expelled from Apple, and he’s already been working at his new computer company NeXT, awaiting the mass development of the Internet.
While a small portion of Cringley’s interviews were used in the Nerds, he says the originals of the interviews were missing during transportation.
It was only after Jobs' death that a full copy of the VHS was found in the director's garage.
This footage, slightly edited, was the basis for the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: Lost Interview, which is released at Landmark Theaters on Wednesday and Thursday.
For a man known for his hatred of detailed interviews, Jobs seems unprepared to expose his technological philosophy and business strategy.
And incredibly thoughtful.
At four different moments during interviews, there are large intervals between questions and answers – 10-15 seconds of reflection, where Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts to be more precise.
There are also moments when Jobs’ perfectionism comes to the surface, where he seems irritated by Cringley’s questions, causing him to move faster to more important questions or phenomena.
In the pre-Pixar era, iPads and iPhones The Lost Interview has something more prophetic when Jobs assesses what he sees different companies do right and wrong, and offers his own vision of the future of information technology.
It’s one thing to read about Jobs’ post-mortem estimates, but there’s something vulnerable and inspiring in Jobs, which we see here, an alarming dreamer on the threshold of greatness.
He has a vision of what things could and should be.
Soon after he said everything here, he went and did it.
A brief summary of the seven significant conclusions of the Lost Interview:
How he learned to run a business:
"All the time in business, I've been asking, 'Why are you doing this?' And the answers you're constantly getting are, 'Oh, it's just being done that way.'
No one knows why they do what they do, no one thinks very deeply in business.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues to describe in detail his attempts to streamline reporting at Apple.
Dismantled by a method of recording expenses, often beginning with “standard expenses” that were taken from the ceiling and then adjusted with “clarification”, he created an automated structure that ensured they could track business expenses to a lesser extent.
It's a joke about the Pope:
Jobs tells in detail about the "blue box" he mastered with Steve Wozniak, a device that enabled people to effectively hack a phone company and make long-distance calls for free.
Much was written about the device before, but Jobs' euphoria here when describing the blue box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
He tells how he and Vozniak tested the box using a phone machine, ordering a call and then connecting from one AT&T network to another until they connected as many stations as possible.
“We covered the globe half a dozen times, and you yelled at the phone machine, and it penetrated the neighboring phone machine a minute later,” Jobs said with a smile.
“We were young, and all we’ve learned is that we could master something that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world.”
We both knew a little bit, but we could have mastered a little thing that could control a big thing — it was an incredible lesson, and I don’t think Apple could ever appear without it.
Jobs continues to describe in detail one famous outlet, which he and Wozniak practically managed by calling the Vatican through the blue box at midnight and asking the Pope on the phone, trying to copy Henry Kissinger.
When various members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two were laughed at just before the Pope was raised to answer the phone.
About the love of technology (and the cold calling of Bill Hughlett):
At the age of 12, hunting for spare parts for the assembly of the frequency meter, he found Bill Hughlett in the phone directory and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone call, Jobs received a summer job at Hughlett-Packard.
“It had a strong impact on me, it was the only company I saw at that age, and it shaped my view of what the company is and how well they treat their employees.”
Jobs later became one of HP’s employees who visited the company’s research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw “the first desktop computer.”
It was the size of a suitcase, it had a small monitor with an electronic ray tube, and I fell in love with it.
I often went to HP when I was a teenager and rode around that car and wrote programs for it.
About Improvised Innovation:
In several places, Jobs’ interview talks about the invention of new products for the summer.
On the eve of his career, when he went to sell a pot of mounting boards, one buyer asked him to assemble a whole computer.
Working only 30 days in the loan, he had to think about both the assembly and delivery of ready-made devices.
Later in Apple, he recalls the difficulties he encountered while developing a computer mouse:
“I remember the angry controversy... they shouted at me that it would take five years [to collect a mouse that would cost <0x24>300], and I was soaked in the throat, and I went out and found a designer.”
Ninety days later we had a mouse that we were able to collect for <0x24>15, which was incredibly reliable.
Large companies that are losing energy:
Long before he led Apple’s revival, Jobs predicted exactly how many industry leaders would be mistaken in seeing the situation and losing control of their market share.
“Suppose you’re working at IBM or Xerox, so you’re doing the best copy or printer, and what?”
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company does not become more successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [this is the kind of people] who eventually come to the leadership of companies, and people who make the product are pushed out of the decision-making space.
The product genius that led to this monopolistic position is pushed out by people who have no idea of the difference between good and bad products – the required skill.
This is what happened to Xerox.
Xerox could have captured the entire information technology industry.
It could be ten times bigger, it could be a Microsoft 90s.
They were defeated by the victory.
Innovation as a form of art:
“A great idea from a great product separates a huge amount of skilled work ... when you turn a great idea, it changes and grows.”
You will learn a lot about its subtleties.
There are compromises you need to go to – some things you won’t be able to make electrons, glass, robots or factories.
You need to keep 5,000 ideas in mind – these concepts – by connecting them all together.
In the end, it all comes down to taste – it all comes down to trying to express yourself in the best that people have ever produced, and later – trying to bring it to what you’re doing.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We were always ashamed to steal great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh famous was that the people who worked on him were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who became the best information technology specialists in the world.
If it weren’t for information technology, they’d do amazing things in other areas.
Skalia and Thomas dine with opponents of health law as court examines case
On the day when the Supreme Court met at closed doors to discuss the politically controversial question of whether he would listen to President Obama’s health law, two of his judges, Antonin Skalia and Clarence Thomas, were honoured for a lunch, sponsored by the legal firm, which would be outlawed.
The case occurred last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the petitions filed for consideration.
One of the issues on the agenda was a petition backed by 26 states that challenged the rapid health review passed by Congress last year, a law that unified conservative activists across the nation.
The judges agreed to consider the process; in fact, the 5 1/2-hour turnaround debate is expected in March 2012, and the outcome is likely to be an obstacle in the presidential race, which will be at its peak by the time the court ruling is announced.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and claim that the health law should be repealed will most likely be Paul Clement, who was the Deputy Attorney General during the presidency of George W. Bush.
Clement’s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual lunch of the Federalist Society, a long-standing group that constantly defends conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored the lunch represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pflizer Inc, which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the gravity.
Lunch was held at the Washington Hotel a few hours after the trial.
He attended, among other things, Mitch McConnell, a Republican leader in the Senate and a renowned opponent of the Health Act.
The honorary guests at lunch? Scalia and Thomas.
Nothing new: two judges have been attending the events of the Federalist Society for many years.
This is not contrary to ethical norms.
In fact, judges are free from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of lower federal judges.
If they had obeyed, they might have fallen under Principle 4C of the Code, which states: "A judge may attend charitable activities of legal and other organizations, although the judge may not be a rapporteur, an honorary guest, or be mentioned in the program of such an event."
However, the apparent proximity of Skalia and Thomas to the two law firms in this case, as well as to a company with major financial interests, was a sufficient signal for ethics activists in the government.
“This staggering violation of ethics and indifference to the code contradicts the statements of some judges that the court remains true to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, President of the General Affairs.
“The judges drank and dined at an official fundraising campaign with lawyers, whose cases are now being considered in court.”
Their appearance and assistance in raising funds for this event undermines all claims of impartiality and is unacceptable.
Skalia and Thomas hardly pay attention to critics who say they are very willing to mix court cases with groups in cases such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas's wife, Ginnie, is a well-known Conservative activist.
Moreover, conservatives claim that this is an ethical issue with respect to Judge Elena Kagan, not Skalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the principal legal service in the Obama administration, when the first court objections against the law were filed at the court of first instance.
Her critics demanded that Kagan refuse to listen to the case because she was too involved in defending the law at the time to be impartial now.
Kagan did not show that she was going to do that.
Boeing Receives Record 18 Billion Aircraft Orders
Emirates is ordering 50 wide-body Boeing 777s and is likely to order another 20.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner Oman Air, the size of the deal is more than <0x24>1 billion.
It is hardly news that the company receives an order for 50 units of its products.
But this is an important event when this company is Boeing Co., and the price tag for all these 50 aircraft is <0x24>18 billion.
Just as important is where Boeing got the order: the Middle East, the growing gold inhabited future aircraft orders.
In a forecast released on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth 450 billion in the next 20 years.
Boeing announced this weekend its largest dollar-equivalent order for commercial aircraft - 50 two-seat Boeing 777s.
An incredible order was received from Emirates in Dubai.
The airline also has the opportunity to buy another 20 aircraft, which will raise the total price tag to <0x24>26 billion, Boeing said at Aviashau Dubai in 2011.
Later on Monday, Boeing reported that Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which can boast of significantly better fuel economy and passenger convenience.
The price of six aircraft will be more than <0x24>1 billion.
“It’s really very good for Boeing,” said Morningstar analyst Neil Dior.
“The quality of these particular buyers is quite high.”
Many Middle Eastern airlines are owned by oil-producing countries.
Accordingly, they not only have the money to pay for planes, but also the rise in fuel prices, which is usually damaging to airlines, as this is one of their biggest expense items, not so losing because the country is making money at high prices.
This is important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel an airline booking when prices rise, Diora said.
“They have natural protection,” he said.
The Emirates order strengthens Boeing’s leadership in the broad-floating aircraft market and helps prevent Airbus SAS from attempting to dominate it with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing's victory at the airshow came four months after Airbus announced it would postpone the debut of the largest A350, which rivals the 777-300ER.
He postponed the debut to increase the axle load after buyers demanded that the cargo capacity and range of the flight be increased.
The shares of Boeing Co rose by 1.5% to <0x24>67.94.
Mexico’s President’s Sister Obviously Lost in Elections in Michoacán
Louisa Maria Calderon claims that the drug dealers helped opponent Fausto Vallejo of the IRP in the election race.
President Felipe Calderon’s sister seems to have failed to make her application for Governor Michoacán’s seat during a fierce public election, and she said on Monday that drug traffickers helped sway the race in favor of one of her opponents.
According to preliminary results, the leader in the race for the governor of the western state is called Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or IRP.
"Intervention of organized crime throughout the election process and especially yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacán, but for the whole country as well," Louisa Maria Calderon said in a radio interview the following day after the vote.
“They intimidated our candidates, our workers in the elections... They had enough urns to vote, put obstacles ... and forced people to vote” for the IRP.
The IRP ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency in 2000.
She is preparing a return, and the victory in Michoacán is an important step in this attempt.
The IRP hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have just slightly outdone Calderon, who led the rankings until the election day.
Calderon, a candidate from the National Action Party, or PND, headed by her brother, refused to recognize Valéjo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, a candidate from the Left Democratic Revolutionary Party, or DPRP, which now owns the governor's seat, came third - a serious defeat for the divided and unsuccessful leftists before the 2012 presidential election.
Aureolas also refused to recognize preliminary results.
Vallejo, the former mayor of the state capital of Morelia, denied contact with drug dealers and called on other candidates to recognize the results.
In Michoacán, drug cartels, specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines, have long been dominated.
It is the home state of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military operation against drug traffickers in December 2006.
Violence continues to this day.
The mayor of the PND was killed a week before the election, when he agitated for Louise Marie Calderon, and several candidates stepped out of the local election race out of fear.
For the IRP, however terrible the election in Michoacán may seem, victory will give a moving impulse to the party.
The man who is supposed to represent the IRP in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said, "I think this victory should be very encouraging in the forefront next year."
ABR convinces Asia to help save eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has obliged India and China to be ready to help save the eurozone from the European debt crisis to avoid a long-term downturn that will stop the Asian economy’s growth.
Rajat Nag, Managing Director of the ABR office in Manila, said the two fastest-growing big economies must “do everything they can” to accelerate the recovery of the currency bloc through either the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the BRIC countries viewed Europe’s difficulties “impartially,” and said Asian financial assistance side by side with European leadership and resources could help avoid a long-term decline in the global economy.
“This applies to all of us.”
“So anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful,” he told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
“Asia may be protected to some extent, but it cannot be invulnerable.”
"So if China and India can help, it must be done."
The European Monetary Union has been heavily undermined by the European debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy’s loans have increased dramatically, and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The emerging debt crisis in Europe has raised fears that it could once again lead the world economy to recession, and has led to calls for leading developing economies to gather together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr. Ng predicted that any Asian assistance would be provided through the IMF, but said bilateral cooperation — such as the purchase of EU financial aid bonds, funds to ensure financial stability in Europe — provides enormous strength in the negotiations of Asian partners.
India’s trade minister, Anand Sharma, said India would “do everything it can” to help the eurozone as its own economy is now experiencing a decline in exports and a decrease in foreign capital inflows.
“No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and restless,” he said.
“We have great challenges, and we need to maintain a high level of growth.”
“It’s not a possible option, it’s a mandatory condition, because where we’ll find jobs for tens of millions of our boys and girls.”
Others argue that there is no point in developing economies such as India helping wealthy Europeans when they are faced with their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshni, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be very difficult from a political point of view to help Europe for the Indian 1.2 billion people, of which about 800 million live for <0x24>2 a day or less.
“At some point they will learn that the Greeks are retired at 50 and going on holidays to the sea, and that will not be well understood,” he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, also asked why India’s reserves should be used to keep Greek numerous and well-paid public sector workers at work in poorly organized, losing businesses such as Prez.
Mr. Ng said the eurozone crisis is threatening "significant direct consequences" across Asia.
ABR’s forecast of 7.5 percent economic growth in Asia in 2011/12 is now faced with “lowering risks” due to a threat from Europe.
He said vulnerable developing markets need to draw up “emergency plans” to protect themselves from the decline and significant capital outflows from their economies.
The Pentagon's Terrifying Warnings About Potential Defence Cost Reductions
Defence Minister Leon Panetta on Monday in congress warned that expected automatic budget cuts would undermine national security and trigger a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors to the battlefields of citizens in Afghanistan and Afghanistan.
The Pentagon is already accustomed to a cut of <0x24>450 billion over the next decade, but now fears that additional cuts of <0x24>600 billion or more could be inevitable if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
"The consequences of these cuts will be devastating for the ministry," Panetta said in a letter to Republican Senator John McCain, Arizona, and Republican Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said Congress’s inability to approve a budget agreement and the resulting so-called sequester initiated a general reduction of 23 percent and the termination of many new projects.
"Such a sharp reduction, applied so recklessly, will make most of our shipbuilding and construction projects impossible -- you can't buy three-quarters of a ship or building -- and will seriously damage other upgrade attempts," he wrote.
“We will also have to fire many of our staff, and since the cut will be done so quickly, we will almost certainly have to fire the staff to achieve the goal.”
“These changes will undermine the trust of those who support our army and will seriously damage our readiness to fight.”
The cuts will ultimately affect the military, Panetta said.
"While military funding in Foreign Emergency Operations is not directly affected by the sequester, military achievements will be seriously affected by a severe breakdown in the main budgets," Panetta warned.
“The contract staff will be reduced, which will end with the cancellation of contracts and the supervisory contract that supports the troops.”
"State staff will be reduced, which will lead to delays in payments to military suppliers, and legal and political support will be violated."
Two senators wrote to the Panetta 10 days ago, asking for details of possible consequences of automatic cuts in the Ministry of Defence.
“The consequence of a sequester in the Department of Defense will be the rapid decline of the United States as the world’s leading military power.”
"We are firmly opposed to these draconian actions," the senators said in a joint statement on Monday evening when they issued a letter to the Panetta.
“It’s not the way we can live, and it’s not the way we should impose on ourselves.”
"Sequester is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and this cannot be allowed to happen."
Whether the Panetta letter or the senators’ latest warnings will lead to budget compromise or reinforce calls for the Pentagon to be freed from cuts will be seen later.
Panetta was absolutely frank about possible cuts, although he came to work at the Pentagon leadership after many years of budgetary expertise in Congress and the White House, and realizing that he was facing a difficult choice.
At a press conference last week, the defense minister painted a naked picture of what might follow: a shelled army, but without a nucleus.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a bullet-free team."
"It's the wing of an airplane without sufficiently trained pilots."
"This is a paper tiger, an army with barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission," Panetta said in his opening remarks in the Pentagon.
“It is a force that suffers from an unstable fighting spirit, poor readiness, and unable to fight potential enemies.”
"In fact, it encourages aggression."
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta revealed new details of how the cuts "generate significant operational risks: they slow down the response to crises, conflicts and disasters; they seriously limit our chances of being the first in the breakdown.
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects could face obstacles, including those that have already passed the tests, and some only in the early stages of planning.
This list includes a single strike fighter F35, a planned new bomber, a new generation ballistic submarine, a new coastal zone battleship, and a new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Marine Corps will need.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 could save <0x24>80 billion in 10 years, but its supporters say it’s a vital next step to improve and counter the potential threats of China and other opponents.
How to Catch a Lie
A fleeting look at the latest headlines shows how serious and widespread deception and lies are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Kane is busy challenging charges of sexual harassment from several women; each side accuses the other of lying.
The University of Pennsylvania administration was charged with false testimony as they allegedly concealed that a retired football coach had raped the boys.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught when he told U.S. President Barack Obama on a microphone that Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies are ruining careers and shocking countries.
New York congressman and internet-exhibitionist Anthony Weiner portrayed himself as a fool, denying his findings, which was quickly refuted by indisputable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with financial fraud during a campaign involving the concealment of extramarital ties.
And again, none of the survivors of that time will ever forget the media circus with President Bill Clinton, who was lying about his sexual relationship with Monica Levinski during his second term in office.
Stories of fraud in exams at school and college are common.
There have been cases when teachers gave students answers to the tests in order to have a good assessment of the results of their activities.
The mentors, who must teach the opposite, send a message that lies and fraud are acceptable.
How much of a lie do we face?
During one day, as studies show, you may lie 10 to 200 times.
It is now assumed that a significant part of this is a lie in salvation.
Another study found that strangers lied three times over the first 10 minutes of dating.
Identifying a lie or detecting a lie is a necessary skill for everyone, both for personal and professional purposes.
Unlike room games, like, say, shards, where you need to shout "Fuck!", detection of lies is a serious direction of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the last six hundred years by psychologists and researchers in prestigious universities.
One result of the study is that most of the old myths about lies have been disproven.
The liars look in the eyes.
They don’t always stop, sneeze, redden or sneeze.
It should not be concluded that liars are difficult to notice and difficult to reveal.
An experienced liar can reach the truth by observing the structure of the claims, the mimicry, the structure of the questions, and the temporal characteristics.
I've spent several years researching scientific discoveries in an extensive and ever-growing segment of knowledge about lies, and it's clear that detecting lies is a modern skill that is easy to learn and that helps in orienting, or rearrangement in our complex world -- especially if you're ignoring them.
Good liars are excellently able to read others, making them feel free of compulsion, managing their own emotions, and intuitively feeling how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men lie more about themselves, while women -- about others, usually to protect someone else's feelings, that married people lie less to their partners than unmarried (but the lie they say is more often).
We also know that if you are perceived as a cheater, others will feel less guilty by cheating on you.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First of all, watch the normal behavior of your object.
This is called the “determination of the original state.”
This helps to provide a starting point for further evaluation of changes.
Observe the pose, laughter, vocal characteristics of your object.
It is good for you to know if a person is constantly beating his feet in a normal state, then you will not make unfair accusations when you see a beating his feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for groups of deceptive verbal and non-verbal acts.
Treat these groups as red flags, not as evidence of deception.
Betrayers can record the upper part of their body when they are trying to remember their story, they can put their feet towards the door, lean towards the exit, change their posture in a certain way, or show “slowness after an interview”—this exaggerated breath of relief, when all is smiling and smiling.
Investigators often falsify a signal about the end of the interview to just look at this relief after the interview.
So, pay attention to your object's speech.
Scott Peterson is known to have retreated and used the past, claiming that his murdered wife was alive, which led to her quests across the country.
Looking people can also use the distance in the speech: “I didn’t have sex with this woman ... Miss Levinsky” or repeat the complex question completely.
The most typical verbal indicators are barely detectable.
Someone can use the “qualification language” when answering a complex question: “Well ... to be honest ... as far as I know ... as far as I know.”
This makes the answer more emotional than actual, and is often a red flag.
There is no magical means to detect a lie, but you can master the deception detection skill.
These skills will increase everyone’s chances of not being a victim of experienced cowards in professional and personal life.
The controversial plan to build the pipeline needs to be revised after U.S. threat postpones its approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to postpone the approval of the planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- causing the trade unions to anger, but calming the environmentalists -- the company that is going to build the oil pipeline will override the project.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that it will remove the planned oil pipeline from the environmentally sensitive Sand Hills area in Nebraska and is confident that the project will still receive approval.
The company announced this decision at a press conference in Nebraska State Capital.
TransCanada official Alex Purbas says the company remains confident that it will eventually get approval for the oil pipeline, albeit with a different route.
This comes after the State Department’s statement last week that it will postpone the decision on the project at the federal level until it explores new possible routes that do not affect the area of the Sandy Hills of Nebraska and the Ogalala acquisition, a huge underground pass.
“This is a real step forward,” said Fox News congressman Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska.
The new environmental review commissioned by the State Department is likely to postpone the decision to 2013, after the next year’s elections, although the authorities denied that the decision involved politics.
In a written statement last week, Obama called the decision a State Department appeal, and expressed his support.
The 1,700-mile pipeline is expected to extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It is expected to ship 700,000 barrels a day from Alberta Province to oil refineries in Texas.
To do this, he needs to cross six states.
It is hated by environmentalists, but is loved by trade unions, who hope to have about 20,000 jobs related to the oil pipeline.
But the Nebraska lawmakers, who oppose the plan, are considering a bill to accelerate the movement from the Sand Hills area and the Ogallalala aquifer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study of the State Department on environmental impacts showed that the project would only have a limited negative impact on the environment, but a source in the energy industry stated that the auditor of the Department ordered a separate examination of the procedure.
One is whether the lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an advisor to Hillary Clinton’s 2008 campaign, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other was whether the choice of the firm that was hired to conduct the initial study was inappropriate as it was affiliated with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle has been sued for allegedly causing nausea in a child
The New York family claims that disco diva Patty LaBelle began raging in the lobby of their Manhattan home, frightening their teenage daughter to such an extent that she was stunned by fear.
Lady Marmalade's tyranny frightened 18-month-old Geneva Monk so strongly that she suffered "personality change, sleep disorder" and "strong fear of strangers," her family said in the Manhattan Supreme Court.
This happened on November 10 of last year, when worker Kevin Monk, his wife, kindergarten educator, Rosanna, and Geneva were going on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk caught the car, Rosanna Monk went down to the lobby of the building on Riverside Boulevard with their luggage, carrying Geneva.
Rosanna Monk said she stopped at the door and lowered her daughter to the floor for a minute.
"Someone came up to me from behind and said, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said 'yes' and went to pick her up,' she said.
LaBelle angered a pregnant woman.
“She aggressively said, ‘You shouldn’t have left your daughter at the door,’” Rosanna Monk said.
“I told her, ‘I don’t care what you say or think.’”
She got angry and started using bullying -- word on C and word on F, -- on high tones...
She had a bottle of water, and she started pouring water out of the bottle on me.
She said that Geneva had started hysterics.
“I said to this woman, ‘Look what you did to my daughter,’” said the child’s mother.
LaBelle ran over to her mother, who was still holding Geneva, and her companions had to hold her and push her into the waiting car, Rosanna Monk said.
The baby was crying so much that she was exhausted, she added.
Later, the family sent LaBelle a letter of apology, but did not receive an answer.
Lawyers and LaBelle representatives do not respond to calls for comments.
The amount of compensation for the damage is not reported, but the family’s lawyer, Sam Davis, said he took care of the case free of charge and that the family plans to donate any money they will receive to the charitable children with cancer.
“The goal is to make Patty LaBelle accountable for his actions,” Davis said.
“Such behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially with respect to a kindergarten teacher with an 18-month-old child on his hands.”
Climate change has slowed the economy
During the first year of Mario López’s rule in Sinaloa, unemployment and the illegal labour market increased, foreign funding decreased and the economy weakened.
2011 - year that will enter Sinaloa's economic history as associated with the first year of the government of Mario López Valdez, also called the year of change, which has generated great hopes for economic development, but given the unfavourable climate conditions of the beginning of the year, there was no economic growth, but there was a sluggish
The low temperatures of February not only led to losses of millions for the agricultural sector, but they limited the growth opportunities of the state economy, causing a reduction in overall economic activity by 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly due to a historic fall of 31 per cent.
According to the report on the areas affected by the frost, provided by the Council of Mexico for Sustainable Rural Development, 835,582 hectares were affected, of which 78.03 per cent were totally injured, and the remaining 21.07 per cent were partially damaged.
The decline in economic activity caused, until November, by the time of the year, the constant growth of the unemployment rate in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography. during the first three quarters, the growth of the unemployment rate was recorded by the year of the year, by the year of the year, by the year of the year, by the year of the year.
Decreased liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa over the course of the year has been stalled by many factors, for economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the Autonomous University (UAS), the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, by actions undertaken in the state.
“What we see now is the growth in unemployment, which is linked to several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market in order to limit the resources imposed by the law that was passed in Congress to fight money laundering,” he said, “it’s not easy to say, as people who illegally own their jobs do not have money.”
Suspended Immigration
Lopez Cervantes said there is also a demographic factor in the growth of unemployment.
"The number of people who leave the state in search of work abroad in the United States was limited, primarily because of the difficulties with entry, and in the second - because once they entered, they are already faced with a lot of difficulties with the job search, so the group of people left.
Violation of formal requirements
The labor market analysis of Sinaloa is getting worse if you pay attention to the large number of violations that prevail in the workplace, according to INEGI, 60.38 percent of the active population of the state is working, not being mentioned as workers in any social protection institution.
In addition to unemployment and disability, another reminder of work in the state is represented by low wages; in the state the lowest wages in the country, according to records of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of Sinaloa workers as of September was 5,352 pesos, far below the national average, which is 7,375 pesos.
Reduction of IEDs
In addition to the decline in economic activity and the high rate of unemployment in 2011, the largest outflow of foreign direct investment in the last 10 years was recorded, according to the Ministry of Finance, from January to July, the IEDs of the state had a rate of <0x24>630,697.3 per cent.
For its part, the Ministry of Economic Development of the state government recorded only 17,280,000 pesos of investment over the year, which mainly came to companies in the service sector.
Duty
Against the background of the economic downturn, the state government requested in July during the state congress approval of a loan of 3 billion pesos, which would be used for investments in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities, to revive the economy as much as a doll, and at the local level it was approved 2.
Reactions
For business representatives, the first year of the government of Mario López Valdes demonstrates a lack of government capabilities.
Miguel Loredo Lopez, president of the National Chamber of Manufacturing, said that during 2011 there was a lack of harmonisation of the wishes of various sectors, including the state government itself.
"The efficiency of the economy in Sinaloa this year was really low, we have to work a lot to restore the positions lost this year, in 2012 we need to double our efforts, we have not been able to reconcile the efforts of everyone and, above all, the success of our good and synchronized new work.
Slowing the economy
Lopez Loredo said that events such as early freezing stopped the state’s economy this year and its efficiency and growth were limited.
“The low volumes of the economy are the result of several events, including the freezing, one of the main effects was the slow economy, which does not become fast enough to create economic dynamics, which allows it to have an acceptable level of processes, goods and services over the years and beyond.”
Revision of direction
Theodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation of Employers of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, said the state needs to continue its most dynamic production activity.
“In general, we have found that we have been working on this, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program that will redefine the direction and economic course of the state, it is necessary to mobilize all the material and human resources that Sinaloa has,” he said.
Upcoming Jobs
President Coparmex stressed the importance of defining the future direction in order to better guide the government’s efforts.
“In general, I would say that the Government is trying to be successful in various areas, there is little progress in terms of economic development, but it is important to develop a long-term program,” he said.
He noted that the current administration had demonstrated progress in its own way of governing public policy.
“There are facts that allow us to say that the government is starting to get into work, and that I can say that some work has been done, and I think the government is aware that there is much more to be done,” he said.
He was sentenced to eight pounds of marijuana.
Five years in prison and a fine of income of 100 days - such a sentence was given to a citizen of Navolato for storing eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Prosecutor General said that the convicted drug trafficker, Omar Alexis Valencia Sandwall, was convicted of a crime against health, in this case the storage of marijuana for the purpose of dissemination.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/MI, Valencia Sandual was arrested by the Mexican military on 7 June 2010 during the patrol of Cipriano Valdes Street, before post No. 80 in the city of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was behind the wheel of a white truck, in which he carried a black bag in a box in the car, and on the passenger seat - a small backpack, where the soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the confiscated person was handed over to the Second District Court and the accused remains detained at the Centre for Legal Impact of Crime.
You need to make contributions to the work
Public works related to programs such as Homeland, Rescue Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of remaining incomplete or delayed for a long time due to lack of funds, Miguel Angel López Miranda said.
The Director of Municipal Social Development noted that while the work programmes have so far been developed, they are at risk as the state government is unable to make relevant contributions, which amount to more than 11 million pesos for all three programmes.
He noted that the total funding of all three programmes amounted to about 50 million pesos, of which 25 per cent should be contributed by the staff, and so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for work, so a delay in their completion is still possible.
“They have to invest almost <0x24>12 million, and even though the year ends, they didn’t give us a penny when they were supposed to give us a share from the beginning of July,” he said, “so that we don’t postpone, we started work and they have made a lot of progress, but we need money.”
He mentioned that last year, during the reign of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the state did not make the contributions he was supposed to make, so at the beginning of the term of the municipality government had to borrow money to cover the state more than 7 million, an amount that was not provided to that minister.
“This happened to us in the previous administration because the state did not have financial opportunities to participate, and the programs continued to evolve, and this year, in order to access these programs, we need to find resources to cover what the state has left behind,” he explained.
Although the State authorities have an obligation to deliver these resources, he said that the request was made on behalf of the Secretary of the Administration and Finance, Armando Villareal, to increase efforts so that interest on them came as soon as possible.
“They have to make almost <0x24>12 million, and even if the year ends, they haven’t given us a penny.”
Court to Approve ‘Transition to Digital Television’ in Mexico in 2015
Replacement of analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has made in recent years.
The Supreme Court rejected the constitutional claims made by the Senate and House of Representatives against the presidential decree, which moves the so-called "transition to digital television" from 2021 to 2015, as there were no eight votes required for its cancellation.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Mesa, believed that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his powers by issuing a decree detailing the actions to move to digital terrestrial television.
As a result, the constitutional claims made by the Senate were rejected because of the lack of a qualified majority of eight votes required for the court to declare the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and it remains in force.
The draft statement, prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed to declare the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of the radio and television program is a law enshrined in the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and re-legislation.
Only Salvador, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted for the project.
On this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies held two constitutional debates to reject the decree and support the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all actions mentioned in it regarding the transition to digital broadcasting.
At the ministerial meeting, it was also decided to reject the request of the Chamber of Deputies without entering into the discussion of the project, also under the responsibility of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said he disagreed with the project's arguments in the sense that the federal executive could not determine by common rules the measures for which the state administration should prepare.
“I also don’t think that if this happened, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body,” and recalled that planning state policy in strategic areas, such as the telecommunications sector, has to do with the federal executive authority, which has a constitutional government mandate.
Replacement of analog signals with digital is one of the most important changes that have occurred in recent years, leading to better use of the radio-electric spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
Delaying the transition, he said, would mean postponing the benefits of digital transformation, which includes meeting public needs, which has not only a technical dimension, “as it covers economic, social, political and national security issues.”
These questions, he said, “require the work of the entire system formed on the principle of state economic governance, including the group of authorities that the Constitution unites into state executive power.”
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the transition to digital broadcasting, and did so with the help of the executive, despite the presence of narrow technical institutions.
From this, it cannot be concluded that the Government, by adopting the Decree under discussion, which in any case affects the competence of Congress, ensures that the laws adopted by the Legislative Assembly are complied with in the administrative sphere.
In Michoacan analyzes the possibility of counting "vote-by-vote"
According to the PPRV, the difference between the first and second places in the governorate elections is only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes coming from 879 out of a total of 6,074 protocols.
The possibility of counting "vote-by-vote" is real, as regards the election process this year in Michoacán, where, according to data obtained from the Preliminary Elections Program (PRW), the difference between the first and second polls of the 7th general polls is 8 per cent of the total votes in the presidential elections, which is 27 per cent of the total.
In light of this, the chairman of the General Council of the Michoacán Elections Institute (IVM), Maria de Los Angeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral corps approved a package of principles to harmonise the local rules of the republic.
As it should be recalled, Michoacan did not adopt the Constitution or the Electoral Code of the State or the Electoral Law, since the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force in this electoral process.
On the same day, 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice (OJC) ruled on a constitutional claim filed by the local legislature, and called the vote of the state's representative on constitutional reform "invalid and illegal" as it does not have the right to "resolve" them.
In an interview about the possibility of "voting for the vote", Maria de los Angeles Llanderal claimed that with the adoption of appropriate principles by the General Council of the IMF, it would be possible to present a partial or complete count of votes by the local electoral body.
For example, a partial recalculation of one or more electoral urns may be made provided that: the results of the protocols do not coincide; there is no voting and document counting protocol in the urn or it is not with the President; or when there are obvious errors or corrections in the protocol.
In addition, a general recount of votes in all polls can take place when there is a sign that there is a difference between the alleged candidate-winner of the elections in question and those who have received the second place in the polls that you have had a share of the ballot, less than or equal to one percentage, at the time of the vote.
The total number of votes shall also be made if at the end of the normal calculation it is established that the difference between the winner and the candidate who took the second place was less than or equal to one percent, provided that there are certain cases of a request from a political party whose candidate took the second place.
It should be noted that in this situation there are elections in Morelia, where, according to the PPRV, the difference between first and second place is only 0.16 per cent, not even counting 129 of the total votes in 923 protocols.
His last will.
His dust will be scattered in the mountains of Sapalinam, the family confirms.
The remains of pilot Felipe Basio Cortes arrived in Saltillo, his hometown on Sunday evening; a witnessing and a restful Mass was held on Monday.

Some didn’t believe him, they said that he had a head rotated even in a truck, but he always wanted to fulfill his dream of being a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Davila Basio remembers him as a very good man, "as soon as he came to Saltillo, the whole family wanted to welcome him, as when he brought Martha Saagun to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that even when he was seven years old, he went to Sapopan for the diploma ceremony of his relative, so he knows that his uncle died doing the thing he loved most in life: flying.
He is guided to the last path.

Three bodies found at NL Caderet's farm
Hours before the discovery, the military authorities showed in the media eleven people who were detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot dead in different parts of the body with a control shot at an abandoned farm in the municipality of Caderet Himenes, Nuevo León.
The discovery was discovered on the 1.5 kilometer highway of Caderet towards Santiago, on a high point in the commune known as El Castillo.
A few people who passed by noticed that in the village house, whose wall is painted in beige and brown, the gate was subsequently opened.
Looking inside, literally within three meters, they found the bodies of three people, they immediately informed the relevant authorities.
One of the men was dressed in a yellow shirt with black jeans, without shoes, and next to him was another man in a white shirt.
Almost one meter away was the body of another person, wearing a red shirt and blue jeans.
All three were lying face down.
According to the evidence gathered there, three people were killed in another place, as there were no shells on the site.
On the blockade of the village house there are signs addressed by one organized criminal group to another, there are also several holes from bullets in it and in the gates.
11 Arrested in Cadernet
The Ministry of Homeland Security has presented 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the municipality of Caderet, and who are accused of kidnappings, murders, "fraud" and secret burials.
According to information released, eight people were initially detained in the Los Alvero colony on November 11 and one person who was hostage was rescued.
They were provided with three homes and a phone, demanding to become members of a criminal group called "Los Zetas".
Another incident occurred on November 12 at 6:00 a.m., the military personnel made a patrol trip to the village of Stara Rancho in Kadereite, when he saw a car without number marks with two men in the salon.
By stopping them and conducting an inspection, the military found a rifle, a cartridge and 18 cartridges.
Later, following these statements, on November 13 at 2:00 p.m., one of their comrades was arrested in the public land of La Pravda, who, seeing the military, tried to escape.
He is accused of secret burials in the municipalities of General Teran, Hina and Kaderet.
A new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday.
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present a new government that will face a crisis that has put the country on the brink of economic disaster.
Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with the President of Italy on Wednesday to present a new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and damage the entire eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace said Monty, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President George Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he could form a government.
It is expected to present a cabinet composed mainly of technocrats, although it is unclear when the new executive body will take up its positions.
Monty said he would present to the president the results of his talks with political parties in an attempt to form a government.
“I want to reaffirm my full confidence in our country’s ability to get out of this difficult period,” the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monty did not say directly that he was able to form a government, but the tone of his comments showed that the obstacles had been overcome.
“The structure is now well outlined,” he said.
Monty completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than usual, as Italy struggled with a political and financial crisis that brought their debt to a critical level.
The administration, led by former European Commissioner Monti, has to approve the package of hard-earned savings required by European leaders to restore confidence in Italy.
Based on pressure on Monti to hurry, unstable markets set BTP bond revenues by 10 years above 7%, a level at which Greece and Ireland had to save.
Emma Marchegalia, the leader of the Italian Employers Federation, told reporters after a meeting with Monti: “We said we will actively support this government.”
We believe that this government is Italy’s last chance to get out of this critical situation.
Monty’s chances of success were largely based on the support of the LDP party Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced to resign on Saturday because of the crisis.
“We believe that Professor Monti’s efforts should lead to a good outcome,” Angelino Alfano, the party’s secretary of the centre-right, told reporters.
The support of the LDP, the largest party in Italy, is important because so far many of its members have opposed the majority of the government consisting of technocrats that form Monti.
Parliamentary support of the
The new Monti government should have strong parliamentary support for reforms that are likely to be unpopular reforms of hard savings.
Any blocking or suspension of these attempts can lead to a new and destructive attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has exacerbated pressure, warning that Monti’s failure could be a disaster.
Monty began his consultations with political parties, unions and business groups, as well as with youth and women’s organizations on Monday.
He will finish his meetings on Tuesday night.
Monty was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who allowed an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief overhaul at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, Italy’s debt cost has now reached a critical level against the background of uncertainty as to whether the new prime minister will be successful.
Rescuing Italy with <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.8 billion in government debt would be too much for modern eurozone financial defenders.
Monty said his government would exist until the next election in 2013, despite widespread forecasts that politicians would only give him time to carry out reforms before nominating new elections.
Monty said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the main parties insist that he should be made up only of technical experts, evidence of their dissatisfaction with what the financial situation affects the process.
Political sources said that mutual distrust and disapproval of parties complicated the attempt to include political figures.
The Spaniards have more gaming experience than Tikos
Of the 22 players declared in Spain, ten have already played in 50 international matches.
From Costa Rica, only one of the 22 claimed players played 50 matches.
A slight contrast with Costa Rica, when compared to the 22 players invoked by both countries in a friendly match today at 3:05 p.m. at the National Stadium in San Jose.
While world and European champions, number one in FIFA's monthly ranking, have a full list of A-Class selection games, Tricolor has only defender Michael Uman as the only one to have played 50 international games.
This figure was reached last Friday in the game against Panama (0-2), at the stadium called Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers, who play in the League of All Stars and in the strong Premier League clubs of England, have been very active in the league and in local cup competitions this year, and they are high-level players in the European Cup and Champions League.
It is worth adding to the experience of the Spanish Fury in a difficult qualification in the Euro or World Championships.
Ticos players, however, have limited international experience in an area like CONCACAF, which is considered the lowest level in FIFA.
We can see that he leads the list of Spanish team goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who last Sunday against England (match lost 0-1 in London) repeated the record of former goalkeeper Andoni Subisarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play against Tricolor today and set a new record in 127 international matches for Spain.
Javi Hernández, a Barcelona player, has 106 matches.
Casillas and Havi were awarded the best last week by UEFA with another Iberian team player, Subisarreta, with 126 matches and bomber Shalke Raul González with 102.
Nearly approaching a hundred Carles Puyol with 97 games.
Javi Alonso followed them with 91, Fernando Torres - with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81, Andrés Iniesta - with 62, Sec Fabregas - with 61 and David Silva - with 53.
Costa Rica side with Michael Uman, left-handed Hunior Dias with 48 matches and bomber Brian Ruiz - with 45.
Next, only five have crossed the border in 30 games: Kaylor Navas with 31, Randall Asofifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The rest.
More than 30 matches in Spain were played by Gerar Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santa Casarla (32), Alvaro Arbelo (31) and Raúl Albión (31).
The team with less than 30 runs on the field has Roy Miller with 26 games, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Murray with 23.
The rest didn’t even reach 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four, Horda Alba has two, and Victor Bolivar has only one in Costa Rica, Olman Vargas and Nelson Edder have not yet made their debut.
Spain’s leading player David Villa has 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Brian Ruiz has scored twice as many points as Carlos Hernández and three times as Roy Murray and Parks.
Quintet included the country on tour in honor of 20 years of career
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true.
In an exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the band is ready to give one of the best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
There have been more than 20 years of waiting, but the band says it's also a dream come true for them to play in this country.
This was a statement by bassist and founder, Jeff Amenta, who gave an exclusive interview with Viva from Brazil last week.
The group is located in South America as part of a 20-year-old tour and on Sunday, 20, will make its only stop in Central America.
On this day, they will perform at the National Stadium starting at 7:30 p.m., together with the Los Angeles team The X and the local group Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, whose full decryption is available online at The Nation.
For your fans from Costa Rica it is a dream come true that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica. Do you know what your fans are experiencing?
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us as well.
This is our only second visit to South and Central America, and so far everything is going well.
I’ve only been to Costa Rica once – on vacation, it’s a beautiful country, and I think we can stay there for a few days.
We are very happy to bring our music there.
I ask this because there is some loyalty to the band; fans live in tension the days before the concert.
What do you say to your most loyal fans?
Thank you for being with us all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, thank you for waiting so long, and we’re sorry we took so much time to get here.
Some people, awaiting your concert, see it as the biggest show of the year.
Does this add a bit of stress to your visit?
“Some of the biggest shows we’ve played in the past 21 years have taken place over the past two weeks.
We’ve had some great shows in São Paulo and we hope this has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
Actually, we really want to play here.
We love this country, we love surfing and jungle in terms of these two things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you find out about Costa Rica and its surfing waves?
We have a lot of surfer friends, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo, and the waves here are amazing.
My friends always travel to surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, as well as Mexico, these are great places to surf, as we learned about it from people who love surfing.
Looking at the tour, you can say that you’ve done great shows with a lot of songs.
What did you plan to do in Costa Rica?
Since we’ve never played there before, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to make the best show possible with a wide variety of songs; we will try to play a few songs from each album and present to our fans a wide variety of repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
How does that work?
I think that's partly because we have nine records and we can play more than 120 songs, and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs that we haven’t played for a while, it keeps us in tune and surprises us because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved those songs and what we might have forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and therefore, I think, makes it more interesting for people.
On this tour you will celebrate 20 years of career.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you’ve done?
Yes, of course.
First, I think none of us could ever have imagined that we would be in a rock band and that what we have been doing for more than 20 years makes it look like a dream.
We are happy with our success and we are very excited that we can continue to create music together.
We all love each other and love making music.
We are happy to travel to places in the world where we have always wanted to go.
For us, it's all very successful.
What does it mean to be a big part of the grenade?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of great teams.
We're good friends with the guys from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It’s great when the movement grows out of a group of friends, and it’s unusual.
From time to time, one group from one city appears, but it is much more strange when five or ten groups appear at the same time in one city.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
I still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden during their tour, so we are happy to be friends with them all and to be an honor to be a part of Seattle’s sound that worked.
It is also very strange that a group like yours stays together and in the same composition for such a long time.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years, and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is much longer than many groups exist.
First, I think we're lucky we're still alive, and second, we care about others.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to this, we have also opened up musical paths that give everyone freedom to experiment.
We trust each other’s music, and it couldn’t be any better.
Your attitude to the word of glory was not easy; but thanks to your success you were able to do whatever you wanted.
How do you find balance?
As we grew up, it became easier to find a balance.
We take care not to be on tour too long, because it is easy to get into this game of big crowds and people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are here for the sake of music, it reminds you that you have to respect the music and what made it, not deciding to be famous and to be a rock star, what none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other project, Manother Love Bone?
I think we're writing really good songs and at first it was great.
We were a band for almost three years and didn’t release any albums until Andy’s death.
There was a lot of disappointment because it took a lot of time to talk about it, and the most important thing is that we were still close friends with Bruce (Fervezer) and Graham (Gilmore), who started with us in the group, and when I was changing the song or seeing the photo, I was thinking about it.
He was a great man and we miss him.
The local group Las Robertas will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you are familiar with her work, especially Eddie Wedder, and that's why you chose her to open?
Yes, the producers sent us a few video proposals, and it was the group we liked the most, so we can’t wait to see what Las Robertas can offer live, and that should be very exciting.
Why are you constantly changing words in Yellow Ledbetter at concerts?
It's a question to Eddie Wedder, so I don't know.
He sings it, and I think he uses the first thing that comes to his mind.
Who influenced you as a bassist?
There are so many.
Among the first to come to mind, Gizer Butler, John Anthvisle, C.J. Ramon, John Dow, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukovsky...
There are so many that I can talk all day about the bass players that I love.
How did Pearl Jam succeed in maintaining the relevance of the grenade, even though it is no longer fashionable?
I think we all feel some disconnect from the word grenade.
When I think of him, he reminds me of the bands I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana, and all those who appeared at the same time, and if it's important now, I think it's great because it's music that's worth listening to, and Mudhoney's teams are like.
At first, your music was darker, and now it has become more positive.
How would you explain this change?
This is interesting because I think there are a few songs on the album that may sound lighter, but there are songs like The End or Just Breathe that are considered very dark, although they may sound a bit positive.
Since both of them when Ed played them, I cried when I listened to them, these songs are very dark.
I think when you grow up and there was some trauma in your life and you lost a family member or a friend, these events are beginning to affect your creativity and your music, and these two songs, of course, reflect this for me.
So, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to create dark music.
Peru:
Fuchimori was hospitalized again for medical examination
Former President Alberto Fuchimori was hospitalized on Tuesday at a state hospital to examine the loss of muscle strength that is being observed in his legs, his family doctor said.
Fuchimori, 72, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his reign (1990-2000), suffers from a number of diseases, including tongue cancer, which caused him to undergo surgery four times and is under surveillance.
Congressman Alejandro Aginaga, who is his personal doctor, told TV channel N that Fuchimori will be examined in three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of pain and loss of strength in his lower limbs.
Aginaga said that in his opinion, Fuchimori should be a candidate for a pardon for humanitarian reasons; however, he said he does not want it because he knows he is innocent.
He carried out four operations on tongue cancer, lost 18 kilograms of weight, to which were added other diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cysts, kidney stones, high blood pressure and problems with blood circulation in the legs.
Fuchimori has been in prison since September 2007, in the National Police Department of Special Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the killing of 25 people by an army destroyer, which acted secretly during the first years of his reign.
Muhika is heading to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official delegation headed by Uruguay’s President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and businessmen will come to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and to start negotiations on the region’s political issues.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with her Mexican colleague, Felipe Calderón, the most important point of the extensive plan of meetings with political, commercial authorities and meetings with the community of Uruguayans living in Mexico, according to a schedule published by Uvdorugru.
The two presidents’ meeting in the city of Guadalajara will be “convenient for the exchange of information on the issue of political relations between the two nations,” the South American leader said on his website.
According to local media, Mujica seeks Calderon’s support for Uruguay in an incident with France that occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country in a list of tax ports at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remain tax havens, a statement that provoked Uruguay’s protest and a withdrawal for consultations of its ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has presided over the G20, a group formed from the most developed and developing countries since November, and has, in essence, with the South American country since January of this year, an agreement to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has sought to accelerate the conclusion of tax-exchange agreements to leave the “grey list” of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, made up of countries that do not benefit from international tax cooperation standards.
As regards the trade plan, Mexico and Uruguay have a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in force since 2004, which has increased trade between the two countries.
The water supply will be 3D with “Super Mario 3D Land”
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for more than 25 years to save Princess Pich from the evil legs of Bouzer, but he has never done it in three dimensions before: in Super Mario 3D Land, he will fight for the love of a girl in stereoscopic technology.
The release, which will appear in stores around the world this month, was created with the features of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without the need for glasses.
“Mario is a hero who must announce how the stereoscopy will work without glasses,” said Omar Alvarez, head of the Nintendo press service in Spain, during the game’s presentation in Madrid.
Alvarez said Super Mario 3D Land is the "first Nintendo video game specially developed under this platform" because so far successful products such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D" have been adaptations of existing games.
Nintendo said that despite its existence in 3D, “Super Mario 3D Land” is an “available” video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and mobile game.
Alvarez said "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to attract less experienced users.
Once started, most experts will go “in the second round” at the levels of the game that are more complex this time.
In addition, users can choose in real time between "D aggressive" or one that only affects the depth of action, but on which you need to play in three dimensions to overcome various obstacles and "do not succumb to optical illusions."
This three-dimensional invasion of Super Mario also marks the hero's return to the portable console, which has not happened since 2005.
In this game, Nintendo mimics the fans of the series and repeats the successful formula from previous games, the waterman with the whales has to go through the dangerous mined platforms to free Princess Pics.
However, the player will discover new movements, decorations, costumes and enemies, as well as the "playing" Luigi.
Colum guarantees extradition of Portillo to the United States
President Alvaro Colom said on Tuesday that the process of extradition of Alfonso Portillo had begun to answer in the United States for a <0x24>70 million laundering conspiracy.
This is the end of the process in which Guatemala responded to a request from a northern country that demanded extradition of Portillo to trial him there.
Colum said at a press conference that his decision was related to the independence of the judiciary and the executive, taking into account that the court of first instance had already signed the extradition.
He claimed that during his mandate, he did not "supplied hands" on legal decisions and took all the extradition procedures he had ever known about.
Along with Portilio Sergio Ruano Marrokin will be extradited for murder and serious bodily injuries, as well as Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for selling drugs.
What Colom has done shows the executive process after all the legal and constitutional courts have been exhausted in order to prosecute the former Head of State from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the judgments of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CP), Portillo will be extradited once with a decision on his legal status in Guatemala and a guarantee of his human rights.
Portillo was found guilty of wasting <0x24>120 million in the Department of Defense during the presidential term, which was a process that preceded extradition, but the Department of Public Relations appealed and reopened the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people from the risk group
The organization was established to prevent the marginalization of young people without education.
The results of the first 25 years of the Trinijove social support organization are important: 6,000 young people exposed to social isolation helped overcome difficult situations during this quarter century.
It is worth adding to this more than a hundred jobs created for this social group.
The anniversary was the occasion for the ceremony held in the premises of the old Fabra I Coats factory, where more than 300 people came.
Trinijove was born next to Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with lack of education, lack of work, and drug problems or marginalization.
Yesterday’s celebration in Sant Andreu gathered a large number of responsible organizations and institutions that have cooperated with the association over the past 25 years.
A different political presentation during the elections showed the unified nature of Trinijove's work.
After the President of the Generalitat, Arthur Masa, and his predecessor, Hordy Puhol, the ceremony was attended by the former Socialist Education Advisor, Ernest Maragall, and the former Lieutenant Mayor and current Ecosocialist, a member of the Ricard Gom municipal council.
Also appeared in Fabra I Coats the current consultant on social welfare and family affairs, Josép Lewis Clarice and the CEO of La Caixa Social Work, House Lanaspa.
He said that Trinijove appeared in a very difficult time and that the current period was also difficult, but added that the work done so far "is a good base."
The President presented Trinijove as an example of the struggle against bad circumstances and the creation of hope in people in difficulty.
“The crisis is not new for the organization and the work done to it,” he said.
The building, where mass parties were held, was evacuated.
Invaders occupied 11 of the 13 floors of the building on Balmes Street, 51
12 occupiers left the building yesterday at noon without fighting
It seems that the nightmare experienced by the neighbors living in house 51 on Balmes Street has come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building, which they illegally occupied and where they organized mass parties that annoyed neighbors, by a court decision without police intervention.
When the operation was completed, the lock on the door was changed to prevent a repeat of the situation.
"From this point on, there will be a pass control here," said the manager.
The squatters, who seized 11 of the 13 floors of the building, settled the rest, allocated all of the electricity and part of the water, painted the walls and left traces of various kinds, especially the jars from under the alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were a venue for mass parties that lasted up to two days and annoyed the owners.
Right behind the building is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
The owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that since the building was occupied, her income has decreased by 80%.
The owner of the club says that the invaders of the building dragged her into unfair competition as they sold drinks for three euros, while at the club for 10.
In addition, the owner of the disco had to respond to the complaints of the neighbors about noise, although, as she noted, the noise was caused not by the club visitors, but by the residents of the squat and, above all, by those who had told how the parties were organized, the frequency and the intensity.
The club's owner said the inconvenience was so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner, and it's been nine months since he's "forgive" her the rent.
The city police also confirmed that in recent weeks it has received more complaints from neighbors about the situation.
The chairman of the PP municipal group, counselor Alberto Fernand Diaz, called last week for "immediate evacuation of the building to solve the problems of coexistence and common spirit that have arisen from neighbors and degradation in this area."
The popular leader explained that by the summer, only one floor of the building was occupied, but in the last few months, squatters have invaded all floors and virtually every room and that some of them were hacked.
In this sense, he added, “it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to resist the unculture that is being created in the building.”
Yesterday, the police evacuated the building to Nou Barris.
At 3:30 p.m., police went out to Montreal Street, 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who noticed four people entering the building.
Four of them were arrested immediately.
A park or a forest?
Architects agree on the possibility of competition after the assessments
16-door municipal competition resumes debate on the role of Kolserola in Barcelona
In the mid-80s, on the rise of the now extinct Capital Corporation of Barcelona (SCB), this administration printed promotional posters for Kolserola.
The booklet described the mountain as a large park in the capital of Barcelona.
Moreover, this was accompanied by a comparison in pictures with the Central Park of New York.
With the death of SKB, in 1987 the park again took place in the minds of many as the highest point of Barcelona as the capital of Catalonia, one of the few that are oriented not to the north-south, but up (top) - down (sea).
The positioning of Colcherola as a natural park contradicts this idea.
The prototype was not Central Park, but Yellowstone, with a wild cabin in the role of a yoga bear.
This was the case until, in September, the council announced a huge competition consisting of 16 competitions for many other gates in Colserola.
Under the door is understood the idea of the park, no doubt.
Either that or someone wants to put the gate on the field.
The question is one: Kolserola? Park or mountain?
The competitions, and their organizational side, and their influence on the city, are a topic for all Barcelona architects to discuss.
This is hardly the most recurring topic discussed when two members of this clan of elected people get to know each other in the elevator.
And this fact leads to just one of the few coincidences between what the three architects of Barcelona and the scientists who were present say.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel Modolo and Mara Bayon: Competition appropriate
For Roldan, after reaching the coastline, it becomes "necessary" to discuss "the front side of the mountain" when the offer of Ildephon Cerda, a mountain with green apples, was not implemented.
“You have to admit that the biggest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, thanks to its excellent accessibility.
Colserola is more complex," says the architect, for whom the headline "Colserola Gate" contains a "verbal trap": we should not think of them "as entering the park, but as limiting some areas where we should act."
Modolo, like Roldan and Bayone with experience in urban construction, called the proposal an "intellectual task" with "some dangers".
Risks arising from the "uncertainty of predicting public space" after the 80's experience, which ended at the Forum's site with "his squirrel song".
The first fear is actually the limit of the boundaries where you can build.
“The limitation of something is the preparation of the next step,” means the transition.
“We need to think about new urban planning tools, because current [in terms of the General Capital Plan] can lead to real disaster.”
Closer to the case, Modolo believes that the simplification of the valley of Colserola "can be understood as a park, Barcelona, not" as a purely topographical issue.
Modolo recalls that there is already work done outside Calcerola, which "is not worth skipping", although he is grateful for the opportunity that the mayor offers his profession, to join this project "from the very beginning".
And moreover, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is a pass that allows architects to enter the debate, but "he doubts" whether this technical profile is what should guide interdisciplinary teams ("success," he claims), which should only be "inkhorrh" that should have been created.
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question asked by the name of this part is complex, as the rules of the competition lack the general type of Colcherola: "There have been announced 16 cross-competitions, - he says, - in the sense of the sea-mountain, but there is no lengthy reading here.
This makes it possible, at least in his case, to decide to participate in 16 competitions.
On the other hand, the project for one gate can be crossed by the program and definition with the architect's project for the neighboring gate.
From your point of view, the council should ensure that the strips directly above Rhone-Alpes should provide in their entirety an area equipped to create a smooth transition between the city and the green.
The casino forgives Jonas Larrasabal and he will be released
After 72 days of settlement, the Red Casino court representative pardoned the Mayor’s brother in a trial against him on charges of extortion.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrasabal will be released after a legal representative of Red Casino has pardoned him before the Second Criminal District Court, which is prosecuting the mayor’s brother, Monterrey.
After the Casino Royale bombing, the owner of Red Casino, Sergio Gil Garcia, published a series of photos and videos where Manuel Jonas allegedly asked him to pay an economic contribution to allow the Monterrey authorities to clear a secret operation in the gambling house.
After a public conviction, the Attorney General opened a criminal case against the mayor's brother and on 2 September, he was arrested and sentenced to 30 days in prison.
After four hours before an agent of the State Ministry of Heritage Crimes, he was sent to a temporary prison located in the old part of the state capital.
He remained there for 49 days, in accordance with the provisions of the second prohibition of movement, after the prosecutor ' s excluded mercenary and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to Caderet for allegedly extortioning half a million pesos from the owner of Red Casino, but he spent only a few hours in prison with an average isolation of prisoners because he was threatened with death.
Authorities allowed him to continue his detention in the municipal prison in San Nicolas in Garza.
On October 25, the arrest warrant was issued by the secretary of the Second Criminal District Court, Jorge Yanes, who said that after almost two months of investigations, there was enough evidence of Jonah’s guilt, such as collecting 1.5 million pesos from bookkeepers.
On Monday, a legal representative of Red Casino, Victor Aldo García Gomes, appeared before Judge José Luis Pesina to apologize to the mayor's brother of the region so that he could be released in the coming hours.
During the trial, the prosecutor in court, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gomes if he had compensated for the damage and who of the gambling house's partners would give a pardon, even though the lawyer tried not to pronounce the name.
On the basis of Record 197/2011, Jonas Larrasabal was granted legal pardon, and thereafter no claims can be made about the process that was planned against him; nor will any compensation for damages and punishment be required.
After hearing the legal representative of the bookmakers, almost at 3:50 p.m., he was ordered to immediately release Larrasabal Breton.
The court servant, Jorge Yanes, went to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolas in Garza to inform Yonah that he was legally forgiven and that his case would be closed.
He will also notify him of the immediate release order signed by the judge.
Minister Dionysio Peres Hacome has told about the details of the disaster, in which Interior Minister Francisco Blake and seven others were killed.
The Ministry of Communications and Transport (MST) reported that the results obtained in the accident, during which the Interior Minister Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people died, showed that the helicopter was hit directly on the ground in an empty state.
During a press conference, Dionysio Peres Hacoma, the Minister of Communications and Transport, said that before the aircraft got up, the pilot found that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"Elements that seem to show the ship had several contacts with the ground, the wings came into contact with the trees at 25 meters, where the vehicle lost its flush."
He also said that the ship was intended for 19 people, respectively, it complied with the necessary requirements for the transport of people.
He also said that studies conducted in the impact area did not report the presence of parts on the ground.
“The study reports that no components of the ship elsewhere, the impact occurred in a state of structural integrity.
“The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers, which satisfies the relevant requirements for the transport of passengers.
The earth in this place has a slope of seven to 30 degrees.
To date, said the secretary, the main thing is to get results as soon as possible; however, the study can take several months or even a year.
Meanwhile, Gilberto Lopez Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said that during the crash, the presidential helicopter was driven at a cruise speed and that it happened on a softly rising ground.
"This information reinforces the hypothesis of the usual summer maneuver at the time of the strike," he said.
At a press conference, the owner of SCT, Peres Hacome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the rules of aviation, the flight was performed according to the rules of visual flight, which means that the team must have visibility during the flight and landing.
Weather conditions:
AICM reports identified appropriate conditions for take-off when the aircraft headed to the border area between Mexico City and the state of Mexico, where cloud layers were observed at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is possible that due to cloud conditions, the team was looking for a smaller and more visible area in the Kuernavak Valley.
Place of attack.
The impact coordinates and the last record from the aircraft's radar probably coincide, before the impact there was no loss of control or change of direction of the flight.
Distribution of fragments in a small area:
The information available so far indicates that the strike has come on the front and side lines.
The scattering of the fragments indicates that the helicopter collided with the ground under conditions of structural integrity.
There were no obvious signs of a fire or explosion:
In the disaster zone remains unfounded evidence in the ship’s fragments, some kind of explosion or fire.
The results of recent studies show that there could be multiple contacts with the earth.
While working on the ground, pieces of the aircraft were found at an altitude of 9,200 feet above sea level, the ground has a slope of seven degrees to 30 degrees.
The pictures show the sequence in which it was destroyed along the way.
The information contains facts that seem to show that the helicopter could have had several collisions with the ground.
After a thorough study of a larger area than the described area near the crash site, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found, which reinforces the assumption that the strike occurred under conditions of structural integrity.
MSS Announces Obesity Gene Search Program
Social Protection leads a study on finding a gene for obesity in children and young people; it is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Protection (MSSI) has announced that it is conducting a study to detect the gene of obesity in children and young people, which has been named the “Genetics of Obesity in Childhood and Adolescent Age” protocol, which will provide an account of the signs associated with obesity.
In his statement, the head of the Medical Research Division of the Specialized Biochemistry Hospital of the 21st Century National Medical Center, Miguel Cruz López explained that a multidisciplinary team of therapists, nurses, dietitians and social workers had been assembled.
This team is assisted by specialists and graduates of the National Institute of Health (NIPH) and the Centre for Research and Higher Education (CINVESTAV) of the National Polytechnic Institute (NPI).
In the study, the population (prescribed or not) is invited to participate by going to the MSSI sports centers participating in the study, in the Valley of Mexico, where tests with children will be conducted every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol began to be conducted at the sports center in Quautemoc (western Mexico), and from October 8 the events are held at the sports center in Nesaualcoyotl (east Mexico).
Once the goal of attracting 500 to 600 children is reached, the study will continue at the Independence Sports Centre (South Mexico) and finally at the Morelos Sports Centre (North Mexico).
He explained that the aim of this study was to understand the components and importance of genetics regarding the development of obesity and to establish a risk factor among children and young Mexicans to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases.
On November 14, World Diabetes Day will be celebrated, and the main goal is to gather 3,000 children and adolescents aged 6 to 14 with the permission of parents and under their supervision to complete individual nutrition surveys.
They will also be asked about physical activity and a history of family hereditary diseases to avoid risk factors that lead to the onset of diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He explained that anthropometric measurements of all participants will be carried out on Saturday (weight, height and waist circumference), blood pressure measurement and glucose levels, fats, cholesterol and insulin, and genetic analysis (to identify the genes associated with childbirth).
Cross López said the study reflects health care professionals’ concerns about worrying weight gain among children.
Medical studies conducted between 1999 and 2006 show that in just 6 years, there was growth: in boys 77 percent were obese, in girls 47 percent; in terms of excess weight, there was also a significant growth,” said MSSI specialist.
He said the rationale for the search for markers was based on the fact that the population of the country differs from other peoples in its genetic history.
He reported that the average Mexican is a descendant of 65 percent of American Native Americans, 30 percent of Europeans and five percent of Africans, and that the condition affected the genes associated with diabetes and excess weight.
He explained that essentially, the result of obesity’s genetics is the body’s inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories), and it is deposited in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the immediate benefit for participants is a comprehensive assessment of children, which can determine whether they have any degree of excess weight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark folds on the neck (acants) and forearms means the likelihood of a metabolic disorder and even prediabetes.
The information is treated with complete confidentiality, the doctors pass it in writing to the parents, to whom they explain all the dimensions and lifestyle changes that must be undertaken to avoid the disease.
Cross López explained that there are three main reasons that provoke obesity, obesity and other chronic diseases: a sedentary lifestyle, or a lack of daily physical activity, spending most of the day in front of the TV, and the use of transportation in the clouds.
This is also due to the high calorie intake, i.e. an increase in the consumption of sweet drinks and carbohydrates (tomatoes, bread, pizzas, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and the genetic predisposition analyzed in this program.
Asphalt UNAM will be able to avoid cracks
Rafael Errera, a researcher at UNAM’s chemical faculty, has developed a polymer-modified bitumen to produce a mixture of the best quality that is environmentally and temperature-resistant.
If the signals sent by road covering were to be paid attention, it would be necessary to repair about 200,000 yards for each rainy season in the metropolitan area of the Valley of Mexico, says Rafael Errer Naher, a researcher of the UNAM chemical faculty, and a researcher, if he adds that
In his lecture Technological View of Holes, read in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, it is reported that the laboratory, for which he is responsible, is developing a polymer-modified bitumen for the production of a mixture with the characteristics close to the bitumen, but with the best resistance and resistance as a bitumen.
Errera Nahera said this type of modified bitumen could be used in places where the weather is extremely hot, as in some cities in the north, to improve the quality of roads and thus counteract the formation of pits.
He explained that bitumen, the heaviest part of the oil, is a sequence of hydrocarbon molecules, some of which are high molecular mass called asphalts, and others of low molecular mass called malts, which together give its character to the roadside.
The highly elastic behavior of bitumen is the fact that at high temperatures of about 180 degrees it behaves like a liquid, at 120 its viscosity is very high, and at 50 degrees Celsius it maintains a nearly solid state, while at very low temperatures it retains a solid state.
This means that the resistance of street asphalt is not constant, but changes over the course of the day, depending on natural conditions and temperature, said a specialist in chemical engineering.
The scientist noted that the streets of Mexico are mostly covered with a flexible coating, which consists of six layers of material, three of which include bitumen.
Among the top layers is the bitumen, composed of small stones dropped into the bitumen and then pressed.
Every stone that constitutes this coating, he said, was immersed in the bitumen.
When moving vehicles and applying effort, it helps the forces to be very well distributed on the road covering.
If it were a modified asphalt, they would be even better distributed, the chemical engineer said.
On the asphalt coating, he added, is placed the last layer, which is called the layer of wear, which is made of small stone, in fact sand also immersed in asphalt.
Since it is a layer that will contact the transport wheels, it should have more resistance than asphalt coating and provide road friction.
As part of the road covering that will receive and disseminate the given effort, the wear layer also requires an appropriate thickness, and the material from which it is made must be taken into account.
Weather, especially humidity and temperature drops, are also very important factors to consider, especially water, he said, because it significantly affects the state of the asphalt.
When the soil is raw, the water penetrates into the coating and it is difficult for it to get out of there, it causes the softening of all the coating layers and thus the formation of pits.
During the formation of the jaws, he said, first wears a layer of wear and only then it affects the bitumen, but the damage does not occur immediately, this process should be paid attention to at the first signs according to the current repair programs.
A member of the National Research System also explained that transport load is another important factor in the formation of holes, and therefore the thickness of each coating layer should always be associated with transport load and it is necessary to ensure compliance with this requirement in order to prevent the frequent occurrence of yams.
Rafael Errera said there is still much to study and do about bitumen, for example, bitumen emulsions, which are already on the market in other countries and even help make holes with ease and without the use of high temperatures.
What wasn't enough for a candidate from Valle to become the new Miss Colombia?
An analysis of the reasons that prevented Serna Melina Ramirez from getting the crown of Miss Colombia.
Vale has been awarded the title of Princess 14 times.
Once again, Valle del Cauca is only left to wish for the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramirez Serna was to be pleased that she got on the podium of the winners with a silver crown and a tape declaring her new princess of Colombia.
In view of the results, that were achieved in the last night's episodes, (19) and (19) (19) (19) and (19) (19) (19) (19) and (19) (19) (19) (19) and (19) (19) (19) (19) and (19) (19) (19) (19) and (19) (19) (19) (19) and (19) (19) (19) (19) and (19) (19) (19) (19) and (19) (19) (19) (19) and (19) (19) (19) and (19) (19) (19) (19) and (19) (19) (19) and (19) (19) (19) and (19) (19) (19) and (19) (19) (19) (19) (19).
A question that many are now asking:
What wasn't enough? Because the result is the defeat of the main favorite, which in each of the performances demonstrated that she has everything to become the new Miss Colombia, not just so she was chosen by the Queen Police and the Missouri that is the Missouri, the most beautiful face, the Vogue, the titles.
The first factor that played a role in the jury's decision to award her the title of First Princess was that she was unable to convincingly answer the question "What book characterizes you and why?" by Martin Murilla Gomes of the literary society.
She replied to the questioner:
“I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it’s a form of culture, and I definitely think that the book that characterizes my childhood – ‘The Little Prince’ – is a pretty deep book.
Today I am reading "Crime and Punishment", a masterpiece of world literature that we should all read; also at this moment I am reading the book of Irina Nemirovska, a Russian writer, a wonderful book called "The Burning of Blood".
A response that the jury did not like because of the term "culture" and, secondly, because it did not specifically explain how each of the books quoted characterizes it.
But after the ceremony, Melina said she was calm and satisfied with her result: “The universal wisdom is what happens.”
And all of you, please, read at least a little, "Little Prince" is a big book."
Among the stated hypotheses, Valle was burned by Favoritism.
The reporter from Bogota assumed that since she was preferred, she was met with ovations, and she was a candidate who received all the preliminary awards (the culinary contest of the Austera, the spectator's vote for the best national costume, and the Queen-Mother).
And this was noted during her first appearance in a swimsuit at Hilton Beach and during her two performances at the evening coronation.
Although she looked confident in both, it was noticeable that she lacked the strength and energy that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantica demonstrated.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist on RCN's How to Home program, said that the fact that Milena was named a princess "signifies that a candidate who wins more awards during the contest does not become a queen."
In addition, Ms. Valé has recently avoided communication with the press, and that was incorrect.
Another hypothesis is that Vale failed to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
That’s why two days before the election, international jury member Lucy Dottie said they were looking for a woman dedicated to their country’s social needs.
"One beauty is not enough for Miss Columbia, we should look not only at the appearance, but also focus on the public consciousness before they take part in the competition, they should already be involved in the projects," she said.
There is also an assumption that Vale made mistakes with defects on the berries and fibrosis, which was seen on her belly, but this is controversial, as the jury especially noted her as a candidate with "natural beauty", taking into account her healthier body, good nutrition and responsible fibrosis.
Queens consultant Jorge Hernán Orosco notes that Melina didn’t have the best body, which was better, “but the problems of abdominal fibrosis that were not very noticeable to me forced her to lose eyeglasses on the last day.”
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Oyos of Cromos magazine believes that the mistake of Vale de Cauca was that she had undergone surgical intervention.
“Operations are good, but Mr. Vale doesn’t know how to do them.
Her body was never her advantage, and here she was punished for it.
Regarding the prize, which was first given by the organizers of the National Beauty Competition, the cruel prediction was made last night, it is said that it was the boy whom Raymond gave to Melinda as compensation for losing the pleasure of receiving the crown.
Whether it is or not, the fact that Melina is starting the year of her reign today, not as a queen, but as a princess, the position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia at one of the international competitions directly indicated by the organizers of the National Competition.
However, she will enter history as one of the queens who, despite her excellent performance at the Cartagena competition, has faced difficulties in obtaining the crown.
This was the work of a man who recognized Alfonso Cano's body.
The criminal from Cali has entered history as the person who confirmed Alfonso Cano's death.
The work of these employees is key.
On November 4, criminalist CTI Cali entered history as a person who confirmed the identity of Farc chief Alfonso Cano by comparing his fingerprints.
Out of the seven criminals working at the CTI, this week it was time to “dismiss” Eliza González, a Puerto Tejada man who spent 21 years in the field of prosecution.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the cities of Choco, where he often had to walk more than five days through the jungle to reach the places where the bodies had to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to Valle, and after graduating from the relevant courses he became a specialist in the field of forensics, where he studied skin friction, i.e. ladders and stones.
In the week of Elizar's operation to identify a man known as Alfonso Cano, he was told to take clothes for no more than three days.
Something big was approaching.
On Friday night, he arrived by helicopter from Kaukasus to Palmyra.
He knew that he would have to identify two corpses, and one of them was supposed to belong to the man who led the world’s oldest guerrilla war, so they asked him to take ten footprints of Guillermo Leon Saens (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research team at the place where the body was located, he did not recognize it in its appearance; it was very different from the one shown in the media.
He was beardless, dressed as a local farmer, without glasses and much thinner.
But the prints don't lie.
Using magnifying glass, ink, blade, and torch, Elizar compared the body’s fingerprints to those in the photos.
His eyes were not blinded: it was Alfonso Cano.
That same night, Puerto Tejada’s representative was asked to confirm to Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinson that he was the head of the RVSC.
Search for fingerprints
The recognition received by President Juan Manuel Santos Elizar González at a press conference on the operation against Kano is particularly significant for the Sijin Dactyloscopy specialist from Cali.
Many people do not know our work.
Dactyloscopy is a strict science, without mistakes, it can play a key role in uncovering crimes.
In addition to identifying bodies, dactyloscopy specialists are involved in investigating crimes such as theft and murder, and identifying detainees.
In detention, many criminals have fake credentials or do not have documents.
We take their prints and look for them in the database.
The investigator said that in case of theft he had to wear a piece of the wall of the house, because in this place the thief stood by his hands to take possession of a safe, full of jewelry and money.
“It’s hard to work with the walls because they’re not convenient surfaces for fingerprinting, but in this case we can take a picture of the whole hand and establish the identity of the criminal who took part in several thefts,” he said.
Fingerprints also help exclude or establish the involvement of suspects in murder-related cases.
Recently, a dead man was found with bottles from under the liqueur around him.
In the course of the investigation, it was found that the crime could have been committed by a suspected relative and, in fact, the fingerprints on the bottle coincided.
Although this does not guarantee that he was the killer, it proves that he was at the scene of the murder.
A dactyloscopy specialist at CTI explained that chemical or physical reagents are applied to places where there are prints.
When they appear, a blade or tape is used to remove them.
After that, the footprints are sent to Asif, which is the criminals’ database, or entered in the register.
“The problem is that we still have a lot of undocumented Colombians,” said CTI expert.
He explained that not everything is as shown in the CSI television program.
Just like not all the gold that shines, not all that you touch leaves imprints on you.
However, if possible, a comparison is made.
“Angry People” Calls New York City Authorities
Hundreds of protesters smashed the camp in front of Zuccotti Square.
Some of the protesters heard the court’s decision to kick the demonstration out of the square and headed to the nearby park.
Members of the "Take Wall Street" movement called on New York authorities on Tuesday when they tried to re-enter, under the protection of a court order, Manhattan Square, from where they were evacuated at dawn while trying to capture another Yacht Bowl.
Hundreds of protesters gathered at Zukotti Square, where they wanted to get thanks to a court order that allowed "annoyed people" to tear the camp down on the square, while the other part of the movement responded to the blast, capturing a park in the north of the city, where further protests were carried out.
"Our idea is that, since the court does not allow us to break the camp on the square, we will tear the camp somewhere else and continue the judicial struggle for returning to Zukotti and through peaceful sitting strikes and demonstrations," - said one of the representatives of the movement.
Bray explained that the response of "raged people" to the evacuation of the town hall, which was ordered by the Mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, personally, came to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued a decree prohibiting the use of force.
In addition, angry people have begun to capture a new park, located at the site of the merger of central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey.
For at least an hour they were able to occupy this place, but then the police arrived and started arresting some of the protesters, although Bray could not name the exact number, but said Efe had seen several journalists who were also in the arms.
The organization assures that several hundred people stood with tents in the place where the delegation of religious leaders went to show support to the members of the movement, trying to act as a mediator in talks with the police.
Meanwhile, Zukotti Square, which is a private property, remains closed in anticipation of the trial scheduled for Tuesday, which will consider the legality of this morning’s prosecution of protesters.
Some of the protesters who went there carried and distributed at the same time copies of the court order and even gave these copies to police guards, which led to "small clashes of bitches," said Bray, who claimed that some of the police had been in the area.
The court order prohibits the authorities from evacuating members of the Wall Street movement and forcing them to enforce “the laws that were issued after the capture began, or prohibiting demonstrators from re-accessing the park with shops and other used property.”
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that due to the court order, the city suspended the opening of a public space and the demonstrators were informed about it, but local laws do not allow them to re-run shops and sleeping bags.
A member of the municipal council personally justified the removal of protesters from Zukotti Square at dawn, an operation during which about 200 arrests were made, and the decision was made because the protesters "violeted the law".
Bloomberg said he ordered the area to be cleaned, as it became "a place where people came not to protest, but to violate the law and, in some cases, to harm other people", as "some businesses have received threats" and neighbors have been "feared of being harassed."
The evacuation carried out this morning was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is deeply more interested in protecting the financial interests of American workers," a spokesman for the movement, who condemns the mayor for "disrespect of freedom of speech."
Wall Street officials also said they intend to hold “big events” on Thursday in conjunction with public organizations and trade unions to commemorate the last two months of protests that began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson Will Become the Virgin Mary in a Special Christmas TV Show
Together with Michael Bubble and other outstanding Canadians, she will appear on the television program "Christmas of Russell Peters" on December 1.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Big Repair", rescuer in "Savers of Malibu", Bannie in "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will become the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas.
CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the crown (ballad performer) Michael Bubble and other outstanding Canadians, will appear on the television program "Christmas of Russell Peters" on December 1, in the role of a very special Martyr.
CTV today presented the footage of a television show, in which Anderson, also known for his widespread online home pornographic video, where she figures along with her then-married husband, the drummer of the group "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Deyes, Deyla Lee.
In this scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian descent, who recently acted as the lead on the tour "My Cruel Torpedo of Truth" by Charlie Sheen, appears in the role of Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the special Christmas show CTV features Canadian singer Bublé, who at the end of March married Argentine model Luisiana Lopilato in Buenos Aires and who also knows the meaning of the scandals.
Bubble recently called the American Kim Kardashian a "sweet" during one of her concerts in New York City.
Japan, resurrected after the earthquake
GDP grew by 1.5% due to domestic consumption and put an end to the downturn that began in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralysed and is still recovering from the devastating earthquake that has led to the nuclear crisis, the most dreadful catastrophe carried by the Sunrise Country since World War II.
According to the first estimates of the Tokyo government, material losses amounted to <0x24>300,000 million - a blow that, despite the severe global situation, seems to be underway.
After three consecutive quarters of loss, data on gross domestic product from July to September definitely helped turn the page: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% on an annual basis.
Registered in the second quarter, - for Japanese the financial year begins in March 2012 - also represents the fastest growth rates from January to March 2010.
The revival may be partly due to the revival of the purchase of machinery for the restoration of areas devastated by earthquakes and subsequent tsunamis.
In fact, the companies increased their investments by 1.1% against a 0.9% decrease in capital expenditure, which was observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real breakthrough in Japan’s economy is not based solely on the Keynesian impulse, which calls for the use of the crisis to strengthen—or restructure—infrastructure, using lies to grow from scratch.
Japan has woken up, mainly due to the growth of household consumption, which now accounts for 60% of Japan’s GDP.
This figure increased by 1% as a result of increased costs for cars, travel and holidays.
Kleemo Yen
Tokyo has provided the domestic market, when the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "currencies of refuge" chosen by investors who want to get rid of the eurozone debt crisis and negative forecasts about the US, a privilege that pushes like a stone at the expense of the companies.
With a stronger currency, products are expensive abroad, which is a serious blow to a country whose economic course is determined by the health of large tech companies.
Toyota or Sony, for example, blame the yen for their low rates from July to September.
As long as the markets continue to seize the peripheral countries of the EU, the government of Eshihiko Noda is not decreasing vigilance.
We need to pay attention to the remaining risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of flooding in Thailand and the sharp increase in the value of the yen, economic policy minister Motohis Furukawa said yesterday.
In fact, the prospects are not exciting.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reported that most of the participating countries showed clear signs of a decline in economic activity in September.
The indicator, which predicts breakthroughs in the world economy, has shown that the main forces are slowing down.
It then fell four tenths to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
The eurozone even fell below the average of 100 points, after it hit eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens again gives grounds for doubt
Papadymos said the adjustment would be approved, but the Conservatives will not sign any written commitments.
With peripheral premiums for risk and uncertainty in the parks, Greece continues to wander around the maze that leads to the outbreak of a major European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "acceptance" of the new transitional government is imposed by the demands of Brussels rather than by the true beliefs of the political forces is beginning to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister Lukas Papadimos warned yesterday that there are no alternatives to structural reforms and that the one-hundred-day period agreed upon in his appointment may not be sufficient for their application, the leader of the new conservative party will be a new idea that "New Democracy" Anton
The main task of this government is to implement the decisions taken at the summit on October 26, Papadimos said yesterday, opening the parliamentary debates, which will be won tomorrow by the vote of confidence of the new executive.
The package of 24 programmes to increase employment, reforms to the Disciplinary Code of Civil Servants and new measures to combat tax evasion will be the first innovations.
However, Samaras’ message does not clarify doubts about his position: “We are ready to help the transitional government, but we promise nothing.”
The leader of the Conservatives has made one step more in his mood towards the EU and the IMF, organizations that should defrost the 8,000 million that are urgently needed by Athens, and explained that he will not give his approval to any letter of agreement with the requirements of the treaty.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the effect caused by Papandreou’s all-or-nothing allegations of a referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demands are unambiguous: it will not renew the help of the conglomerate if the new government and the leaders of the main sub-parts do not write.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Economy, Amadeu Altafay, said the inspectors of the trio could "very soon" return to Athens to discuss with the new government "what needs to be done to pay the sixth tranche" of <0x24>8,000 million, though it is not yet accurate.
In the Greek club, the threads will be enough for a while.
Ms. Sofia: "These are the instruments of progress and hope"
The Queen emphasizes Spain’s “main” place in this type of finance
Spain has “occupied a prominent place in the world in the field of microfinance.”
Queen Sofia reminded yesterday that over the past two decades, the country has become the second largest donor in terms of co-operation tools, whose "essence," she said, is that it is a "basic tool for social progress, justice and hope for a better future."
The Queen opened yesterday the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that such actions are "absolutely necessary" to achieve the Millennium Goals - the one-millennium goal, the one-millennium goal, the one-millennium goal, the one-millennium goal, the one-year goal, and the one-year goal.
Spain is "still working" to expand the network of recipients around the world and takes on this task with all the "responsibility," said Don Sofía, and hopes that the efforts and achievements of the summit, which will continue until Thursday, will "provide for the creation of new and possible skills".
There are “a lot of achievements” and “a lot of difficulties that we are facing.”
The micro-credit summit is becoming not only a platform for disputes, but also a platform that contributes to "two main objectives".
Her Majesty has thus explained that she hopes that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families will benefit from these financial services, and one hundred million of these households will get out of the poverty they are immersed in.
The impulse to create a micro-credit system in Spain and in the rest of the world "has gone the way started years ago" by Muhammad Junus, she stressed as "an act of justice and recognition".
And she described the father of the instrument as an “astonishing idealist in the general cause of poverty” whose work has been known for 15 years, since the queen went to Bangladesh to study on-site his lending policy.
This experience took over the first World Summit in Washington, D.C., and other meetings such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "everywhere I've seen continuous development," Her Majesty said in a statement.
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded the speech, urging the participants to participate in the discussion and find solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"The Ethical Imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Himenes said solidarity is an “ethical imperative” for every democratic state.
In this regard, she said it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic boom, as it is a "permanent commitment".
Kimenes concluded that micro-credit involves a “serious and solid course aimed at eradicating poverty” and now “more than ever” developed governments must work according to the criteria of solidarity and not allow it to become a victim of cost cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is “one of the main areas of cooperation for development”.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, praised the "success" in giving "confidence" to the people "dressed, all doors closed," and the Mayor of Valladolid, who was co-chaired by Francisco Javier de la Riva, welcomed the city "to everyone."
HDS proposes to elect the President of the European Commission by universal vote
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) on Monday 14 November in Leipzig was without significant problems for Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is also the chairman of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally planned in the program, but it came about in the fall itself, in particular, to satisfy activists who believe that the government’s policy is not as strict as it should be today with respect to Greece and perhaps tomorrow with respect to Italy.
The draft resolution on the Presidency of the European Commission, submitted for discussion by the Chair, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The ovations, which lasted for a few minutes, which earned Angela Merkel’s performances and a few hours later Wolfgang Schoible, Europhile and Finance Minister, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the chancellor and the draft resolution is expressed in the slogan: the correct answer to the crisis is "not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but because “nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro”.
The chancellor said it was time for a breakthrough in Europe.
This could mean changes in the Lisbon Treaty to make it possible to strengthen the European Union's control over the financial policies of eurozone countries, but it could also affect the election of the President of the European Commission by a general vote "to give Europe a face".
In any case, this is one of the proposals for a draft resolution adopted by Congress, the idea of which obviously belongs to Wolfgang Schoibla.
Of course, it is unlikely that twenty-seven countries will agree quickly with this decision; the UK is against it, and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is against it too.
But the soil is ready.
Similarly, delegates by an overwhelming majority rejected the proposal to weigh the vote of each EU member country on the board of the European Central Bank according to the size of the economy of each of them, which would significantly increase the weight of the German economy.
Desiring to calm the situation in her party, the chancellor increased the number of references to Conrad Adenauer and Helmut Kol, but she did not seek to influence Congress at the expense of "small" European countries or countries that are in a difficult position who like to "criticize."
Although the entire paragraph in the draft resolution on Europe deals with the importance of "German-French friendship", Angela Merkel did not mention France.
It's just a passageway.
Recalling that two centuries ago, Leipzig became the scene of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What Is Hospital Letter Fraud?
Following the loans, the UMP and the government began an attack on hospital papers.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux to visit the Family Benefits Distribution Fund and to speak on this issue, which has been raised periodically since 2007, on the fight against social benefits fraud.
And to help this offensive, which arose from the desire to save in a difficult situation, but also a part of the re-election campaign, most want to focus on hospital papers.
First and foremost, with regard to budget savings, the Government intends to impose on employees of private companies a fourth day of unpaid leave prior to the payment of the benefit.
Obviously, without the special consent of the employer, the sick worker will lose a salary for four days equal to a minimum of 15% of his/her monthly income.
The measure, which threatens to generate a storm of anger, but which, according to Les Echos, will save <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>280 million.
And which will be accompanied by other measures with a more symbolic effect, namely to impose on public servants one day without payment of the sickness allowance (the public servants have not yet had to wait for the payment of the allowance, as opposed to the three-day waiting period at work).
Now that these issues are being discussed, the majority also again raises the issue of fraud, referring to the abuse in the issuance of hospital leaflets.
Control will be harder and additionally, if you are caught, you will have to return all illegally received payments,” Xavier Bertrand warned on RTL on Saturday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effect of the application was somewhat disproportionate to the actual abuses of hospital papers.
In fact, they have been under constant surveillance and political attacks since 2002, which bear their fruit.
People in France are not sicker than anywhere else in Europe.
Let’s first look at the country’s figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>237 million of daily compensation was paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation of the Health Economy, the daily compensation costs in 2008 amounted to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.3 thousand million and accounted for 5% of the total health expenditure.
Of this amount, 46% were for decree holidays and accidents at work and 54% for sickness allowances, which amounted to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6.2 thousand million.
Thus, they accounted for 2.5% of health-related expenses.
The French spent an average of 14.5 days at the hospital in 2010 compared to 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by Alma Consulting Group.
The average arithmetic, which hides some deviations; another study published in 2007 by the Monster.com career management site, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French workers surveyed said they did not take a single day to the hospital.
Another study, this time concerning health insurance, claims that in 2010 37% of hospitals lasted less than 8 days, 15% from 15 days a month, 15% from one to three months, and 11% lasted longer.
By comparing these figures with the figures of European neighbours, it can be seen that French workers are not more likely to take the hospital than workers of any other country.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers found that between 1994 and 2001, the overall rate of absence at work in France (for health reasons or not) varied between 10% and 11%, compared with 20-28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom and 16% in the Netherlands.
The level of fraud associated with hospital papers is very low compared to “gray” employment.
As for the level of fraud, it is very low.
The hardening of the law after 2002 resulted in a systematic check-up of hospitals lasting more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million verified cases, CNAM found that 13% of the 285,000 short-term disease findings were “unjustified” or too long,” representing 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically checked hospital leaflets over a period of more than 45 days, 11% of the 1.2 million cases were "inappropriate or unfounded", which is 132,000.
Overall, it turns out that 169,000 cases were "unfounded" for several million employees who received hospital papers.
The figures that show very few cases compared, for example, with the figures of "gray" employment.
According to UMP deputy Dominic Tian, the author of the report on this issue in June, they make up between 9 billion and 15 million euros of low-budget revenue per year, which exceeds the total cost of daily compensation, and therefore infinitely higher than the losses.
Papadymos: Greece must follow new settlement plan <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Greece needs a new settlement program to save its economy.
On Monday, Prime Minister Lucas Papadimos said in parliament that the 100 days allocated to his coalition government were insufficient to accomplish this task.
"In order to achieve the goal of saving the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment program," the head of government said in a statement, opening the debate on a vote of confidence in parliament on Wednesday.
Implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on October 27 should be "the main task" of the new government, as the country's presence in the Eurozone is "on the map", he added.
Accordingly, Papadimos predicts a reduction in the country’s budget deficit “approximately to 9%” from GDP by the end of the year, with 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Right-wing rejects new government measures
On Monday, right-wing leader Antonis Samaras expressed his support for the measures already taken to try to get out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not support additional measures of strict savings.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said at a meeting with deputies from his New Democracy party.
He agreed with the tasks of reducing deficits and debts and combating debris, but also with the rejection of any course that hinders the recovery of the economy.
Ollie Rena, European Commissioner for Economic Affairs and Finance, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8,000 million loan without written guarantees from all parties that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras said.
It is necessary to legalize euthanasia and suicide with foreign assistance, says expert committee
Canadians refused to die, says the report of the Royal Society of Canada
With regard to palliative medicine, the Committee argues that the government, health institutions and doctors are working together to provide the best palliative care, not counting cancer cases.
The Canadians refuse to die.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to tell their doctor when they want to die and take steps in this direction.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts from various fields, including ethics, law and medicine, took part.
The Committee proposes to the Government to amend the Criminal Code so as to permit suicide with extraterrestrial assistance and euthanasia, when this choice is imposed by circumstances and the patient can be deemed competent to make such a decision.
To begin with, the experts refer to a recent study by the Economic Expert Bureau, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada is 10th, the study notes that “the medicalization of death in Canada has given rise to a culture in which people are afraid to argue about death.”
Because of medicalization or not, but 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada report.
And 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
The highest rate in the country is in Quebec, where 86% of deaths occur in hospitals.
On the delicate issue of euthanasia and suicide with foreign assistance, the authors of the report come to the conclusion that it contradicts the position of the federal government, which has already stated that it does not want to change anything in the criminal code regarding euthanasia and suicide with foreign assistance.
Now, according to experts, who have also studied the position of all countries where such acts have been legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization involves abuse in the use, i.e., the non-prosecution of euthanasia or suicide, which may not be carried out by a foreign aid.
On the contrary, during the teleconference, Jocelyn Downey, who presented the report, confirmed that the majority of such cases were in countries where euthanasia and suicide with foreign assistance were not legalized.
Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.
Suicide with foreign aid is practiced in Canada, where it is obviously illegal, explains Jocelyn Downey.
Canadians for Euthanasia
It should be remembered that 85% of Canadians are in favour of euthanasia because, according to the 2010 Angus Reid survey, they believe it will allow people to ease their suffering at the end of their lives.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not be a signal that the lives of the elderly or the disabled are of less value.
As for people who assisted in suicide, 41% of respondents believe they should not be prosecuted.
Regarding the extension or discontinuation of medical care for the patient, the situation is less clear, the authors of the report say.
They also propose, in addition to their other recommendations, that the Criminal Code should establish that the legally lawful termination of medical care is not a crime.
The Committee of Experts also calls for health professionals to be trained in a spirit of respect for the refusal of end-of-life health care without fear of criminal prosecution.
With regard to palliative care, the Committee calls on the Government, health care institutions and doctors to work together to develop the best possible palliative care, not just in cancer cases.
Finally, with regard to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee requires that it be applied when it does not serve as a relief for physical pain as euthanasia and is subject to the same restrictions.
Comments from other experts
Some experts in health-related legislation have already commented on the conclusion of the report of the experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Meter Pierre Deshan, a specialist in health legislation, described the position of experts who signed the report as "extreme" because among other things, it does not limit the use of euthanasia to fatal cases.
This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and someone over the age of 18 can ask for help in committing suicide, says Meter Deshan, who discussed the summary of the report yesterday.
Metre Desham also stressed that the authors of the report appear to place personality independence above all other values that make up the social fabric of society.
He said that “there are warning signs and prohibitions in society.”
Health lawmaker Margaret Somerville also expressed "a categorical disagreement with the findings of the report, which she called "the manifesto for euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, in particular, contests the data of the report on abuses in some countries where euthanasia and suicide with foreign assistance are legalized, as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
Jordan’s King Calls President Assad to Resign
Damascus condemns 'conspiracy'
Syria is increasingly in isolation.
The supporters of Bashar al-Assad held a demonstration yesterday in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs building.
Yesterday increased diplomatic pressure on Syria by Bashar Assad, who, with Russia’s support, opposes him and condemns “conspiracy” against his country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria’s membership in the Arab League, the European Union tightened sanctions against Damascus, and neighboring Syria, Turkey and Jordan, advocated the resignation of President Assad.
Jordan’s King Abdallah II was the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar Assad to surrender power in Syria, where some 40 civilians and members of the regime’s armed forces were killed.
"If Bashar had the interests of his country, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the necessary conditions for a new phase of political life," Jordan's king, who is neighboring Syria, said in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, in turn, regretted that Turkey’s mediation efforts, which began earlier this year, were unsuccessful.
Those in the Middle East who do not live in peace with their people and cannot satisfy their aspirations will lose power, he said, pointing to Syria, a neighbouring country to which Turkey is taking an increasingly harsh course.
The United States, for its part, welcomes the “expansion of the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime” following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States and countries like Turkey are taking an increasingly harsh course on the repressions in Syria, said Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 representatives of the regime’s armed forces have been killed in the Deroa area in southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) reported.
Two other residents were killed during the shooting and heavy gunfire in Jobar in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
During a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Valid Muallem said that the country is approaching the end of the crisis.
In addition, he reacted sharply to the Arab League's decision to exclude Damascus, which he said was a "dangerous step".
Syria will not be broken, he added, confident that this conspiracy against Syria will fail.”
Following its decision to exclude Syria, the League of Arab States is currently examining the “mechanism to protect civilians and demands the loss of 500 members of the Arab human rights organization, journalists and military observers in the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also called for sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the regime’s repressions, which he said fell into “paranoia.”
The League’s new emergency meeting is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of a plan to get out of the crisis, adopted on November 2 and which provides for, in particular, the withdrawal of armed forces from the cities where the fighting is taking place, and the liberation of the prisoners of war.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called the Arab League’s decision “incorrect” yesterday, while China called on Syria to implement a plan to get out of the crisis, but refrained from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.

Monti demands time in markets and victims from Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets to take some time to form his team and execute a program that would require “victims” to restore the creditworthiness lost in the last few months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner took part in a discussion with political parties yesterday before today’s meeting with trade unions and employers.
He will have to form a relatively moderate cabinet made up of technocrats who are not members of parliament.
Monty spoke about the importance of the program, which involves many casualties, said Francesco Nucara, a representative of one of the numerous small parliamentary groups participating in the discussions after meeting with the prime minister’s candidate.
Speaker of the House of Representatives Jan Franco Fini said he would wait to see if Mario Monti would ask parliament to vote on confidence by Friday to make sure the new government has enough support.
The meeting will end with the presentation by Mr. Monti of a limited list of a dozen or so ministers to the head of the country, Georgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monty commented on yesterday's nervousness of stock exchanges and bondholders, asking them to take time.
“Democracy needs time to prepare government and program,” he said, adding that he is convinced that markets will be patient and understandable.
His appointment as president was initially approved by the markets, but the concern arose again, especially after the sudden decline in industrial production in the Eurozone in September.
The appointed prime minister had to form a team that included, most importantly, technocrats, although he stressed that he also wanted to include "politicians".
The new government will have to act until 2013, the dates of the next election, he said.
Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies Jan Franko Finney said the new government will receive a vote of confidence from the parliament on Friday.
Mr. Monti ensured that, by taking up the post, he would work hard to ensure that Italy would once again become an important player in Europe.
European Commissioner Ollie Ren said: "Despite the new government, our assessment of the Italian economy has not changed."
The European Union, convinced that Rome will not implement the budget for 2013, despite the strict savings plan adopted in recent months, has called for, in particular, new strict measures.
Italian “boss boss” Emma Marchegalia, who will meet with him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to restart the economy, “because a country that has no growth can’t comply with the deficit parameters.”
Mr. Monti, renowned for his competence and independence in essence by the European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents the "change of era" for Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism", "professor" symbolizing "serious calls" and "other Italy" in the words of Avtoro.
The big unknown is the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would be happy to avoid an emergency election, as by April 2012 Italy is due to make payments on government debts of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200,000 million.
Russian Scientist Assists Iran's Nuclear Program
Russian scientist Viacheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator suitable for use in nuclear weapons, the U.S. agency specializing in nuclear hazards confirmed on Monday.
The Institute of Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on a recent report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents from this agency to establish the identity of this scientist.
Last week, the IAEA expressed concern about the “possible military aspect” of Iran’s nuclear program.
According to ISIS, which relies largely on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko was born in 1934, worked for 30 years, "since the 1960s, at the Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds".
In 1989 or 1991 he left the center to create a company that produces "nanoalms" in Kiev.
The financial difficulties of his company led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then worked with the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its report, IAEA mentions “clear signs that Iran’s development of the nuclear detonator system has been assisted by the work of a foreign expert who not only knew this technique well, but who also informed the agency that he had worked most of his career on this technology within the framework of the program.”
The number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by 50%
According to the FBI’s statistics published Monday, between 2009 and 2010, the number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by almost 50%, while during the same period other forms of racial and religious violence declined or did not change slightly.
According to these figures, the total number of cases of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, which is equal to an increase of 49%, compared to an increase of 13% in cases of violence against Catholics, a decrease of 4% in attacks against Jews and a total increase of 14% in attacks against Jews.
The total number of hate crimes, according to the FBI, increased very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences.
After the decline in 2009, there is concern that the number of these crimes is growing again, Human Rights First stresses, “the increase in cases of violence against Muslims is particularly significant,” the organization added in a statement.
“Human Rights First has long stressed that acts of violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be seen as serious human rights violations,” said Paul Lezhnandr, the organization’s leader.
“The U.S. government can and should do more to address these crimes, he adds, believing that this can be done by improving police records of hate crimes.”
“Hate-based crimes” in the federal law are the legacy of the period of civil rights struggle.
This law was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish for acts of violence related to race, color, religion, nationality, and today with sexual orientation.
Twitter is changing its platform and becoming similar to Facebook
On Monday, Twitter’s microblog website made changes to its platform, which will allow its users, in particular, to see the activity of those they are tracking, which makes this service similar to Facebook.
The new “activity” tab and another “name” allow you to track more easily and directly the activities of other “tweets”, the internet users whose messages you track (“tweets”) and those who track yours.
This gives you the opportunity to know if they publish messages, if they sign up for new accounts, if they have selected messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before it was released widely across the network on Monday, AFP spokeswoman Caroline Penner said.
Twitter, which has long been known as Facebook intuitively rather incomprehensible and using rather vague terms (RT for re-posting someone else’s message, <0x23>followfriday for recommending tracking other users), is mostly a good idea for more users and more experienced users.
On the network, users discussed this innovation with the help of “tweets” on the Internet.
“It’s useless, coercive and too much reminiscent of Facebook.”
Functional activity will help me better track certain elements of my Twitter feed, <0x40>dannykronstrom wrote.
Austrian
Introduction to the Constitution of the "golden rule" of the budget
The leadership of a large coalition of social democrats and Christian democrats in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to write a budgetary "golden rule" into the constitution to reduce the budget deficit and thus avoid a possible lowering of the ratings.
Social-Democrat Chancellor Werner Faymann personally announced this decision at the end of the meeting of the Council of Ministers, with the Austrian government debt at 74.6%, which is significantly higher than the upper threshold of the norm at 60%, as set by the Maastricht Treaty, and is lower than the state.
If Austria’s solvency had fallen by only one point, from AAA to AA<0x2B>, we would have to pay interest on three thousand million euros more each year, said Deputy Chancellor and Foreign Minister Michael Spindeliger from Christian Democrats.
Austria thus meets the requirement of the Eurozone summit on 26 October in Brussels; the Heads of State and Government have called for a reduction in budget deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to balanced government accounts through a constitution or equivalent law.
The ruling, adopted by the Austrian government, resembles the "German model", as Germany was the first European country to adopt the "rules".
By 2017, the structural deficit of the state budget should be reduced by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and from 2017 the structural deficit of the federal state budget in any year should not exceed 0.35% of GDP, and the land, as well as the municipalities, should be balanced budgets.
The goal is to make the government debt fall below the 60% mark fixed by the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/2021.
Eshihiko Noda
Threats to new intervention in the foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Eshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would carry out new interventions in the foreign exchange market if the price of the yen continued to rise.
We intervene, as we did last time, considering the excessive volatility of the yen exchange rate, Mr. Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen grew almost to a historic mark, which prompted Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo sold the yen for the dollar on a large scale to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which has set a new force record since 1945.
But the yen has since grown steadily, adapted to the purchases of investors who see it as a “refuge” in these turbulent times of the global economy and the debt crisis in Europe.
On Tuesday, the dollar fell below 77 yen, and the euro fell below the symbolic bar at 105 yen, close to the level that triggered the last intervention.
On the eve of the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar cost about 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
The growth of the Japanese currency is damaging Japanese exports, as it makes Japanese products more expensive and reduces the income of Japanese firms from overseas when converting into national currency.
"Japan is fighting to restore itself" after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region (northeast), Mr. Noda stressed, fearing that this growth of the yen will kill a fragile embryo of recovery.
The world's third largest economic power resumed growth in the third quarter - 1.5% compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in a year, thanks to the increase in exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster.
But the prime minister feels that the high price of the yen does not reflect Japan’s “fundamental economic indicators.”
Finance Minister Jun Adzumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council on Tuesday, to take all necessary steps to weaken the yen.
But Deputy Managing Director Hirohide Yamaguti warned that the Bank of Japan had already taken "appropriate steps" and made it clear that no further mitigation should be expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting at the end of October, the issuing organization increased the purchase of Treasury bonds by 5,000 million yen (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>47 billion), raising to 55,000 thousand million yen (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>519 million) to buy the ceiling of the amounts that were
Eurozone
Prices are rising, stock exchanges are fluctuating
The risk of a debt crisis undermines European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of state in Greece and Italy and improved growth rates in France and Germany, rates in unstable countries continue to rise
Still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, European exchanges went on Tuesday, November 15, a little further into the negative zone.
At 10 a.m. in Paris, CAC 40 lost 1.4% and finished the trades at the level of 3,064 points.
The DAX in Frankfurt fell by 0.4% and London by 0.1%.
Due to the new difficulties in repayment of loans by eurozone countries in a difficult position, stock markets around the world continue to lose some of their recent achievements.
“Concerned investors are just too worried about the risk of infection,” said Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed with a 0.7% drop under the burden of new market participants’ doubts about Europe’s ability to contain the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has accelerated its view of Europe, and the exchanges will follow each other in the corridor of narrow changes until investors have evidence that the situation has stabilized,” said Mitsuige Akino, Investment Management’s manager at Ichiyoshi.
This reversal of concern about the future of the eurozone hits a single currency, which continued to fall on Tuesday.
The euro has reached its lowest mark in a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was worth <0x24>1.3570, falling by 0.4%.
According to the brokers, it fell after Chancellor Angela Merkel's party Congress on Monday, in which a resolution was adopted, providing, in particular, the possibility for a country in a difficult position to leave the Eurozone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates are significantly higher than 6%
Loan rates in Italy and Spain remain at a level that is highly alarming.
On Tuesday morning, the return on Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, and the return on Spanish bonds with the same repayment period reached 6.2%.
These difficulties with interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the concerns of the participants.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the time exchange to restore the situation in Italy, which is at risk of paralysis under the weight of its debt.
Greece’s new Prime Minister Lukas Papadimos has confirmed that the implementation of the decisions adopted at the eurozone summit on October 27 will be “the main task” of his government.
Spain was hit by markets before the parliamentary elections on Sunday.
The spread between interest rates on the 10-year debt liabilities of Germany and Spain reached a new historic high.
Expecting growth in the Eurozone
France recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than expected 0.3%, thanks to the increased consumption of households.
Insee, in spite of this, revised towards a decline in the second quarter, with a drop of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
Economists are most concerned about the fourth quarter.
Germany, in turn, recorded an increase of 0.5% over the same period.
The first assessment of the euro area is expected at 11 a.m., the European Commission warns of the danger of a new recession.
Energy Policies:
Facts must prevail over dogmas.
If there is a topic that cannot be decided after a short discussion or under the influence of emotions, then it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affects the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is a healthy tendency that electoral meetings become a reason for reflection on the share and place of nuclear energy.
The dispute will not bear fruit until all the economic, social and environmental impacts of the proposed options are studied.
France must build its opinion on objective facts and on rational data.
Today, 7 billion people on the planet, demographic development will result in doubling the need for electricity by 2050, unless a large part of the world’s population is deprived of vital elements.
During the same period, it will be necessary to replenish the growing shortage of mineral resources in order to continue production of electricity constantly, not forgetting the crucial need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to address climate imbalances - a topic that has disappeared from the ecological imbalances.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these factors.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to give up nuclear energy.
It is not the case of Belgium, which puts its solution depending on the need to find a source capable of replacing nuclear energy, or Switzerland, which intends to build only the most modern reactors.
On the other hand, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil - these are just a few of those who are determined to continue their projects.
The United States decided after Fukushima to add one plant to its kit, resuming the construction of the station, which was interrupted after the accident on Tri-Mil Island.
Although the model of Germany based on renewable energy is sometimes given as an example, reality contradicts this argument.
The choice of Berlin will result in an increase in the cost of electricity, an increased energy dependence, aggravated by the increased need for imported gas, in particular from Russia, the leaps in carbon dioxide emissions due to the construction of gas and coal.
In a few months, all these unpleasant effects will already be felt.
Consider the example of Denmark.
The European champion for turbines, from which it receives 30% of its electricity, is also the largest consumer of coal and gas due to the interruption of the wind; due to which carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices are 65% and 50% higher than the average.
On the other hand, thanks to the stability of our energy policy, our neighbours pay 40% more for electricity than French households.
As in a globalized economy, the price of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of the service of industrial equipment on the national territory, French companies are benefiting from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in nuclear energy will lead to a large increase in the cost of electricity, which will make illusory beautiful statements about the new industrialization of our country and the protection of purchasing power.
The price that most French people refuse to pay, especially because they do not object to this type of energy in principle.
It should be remembered that the country's energy policy has made it possible to create an industry with 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 intermediaries.
Strongly export-oriented, it attracts a plethora of small and medium-sized enterprises specializing in international trade and creates many jobs that cannot be relocated to another industry.
If France had decided to give up nuclear energy, it would have donated a large number of these enterprises and would lose <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 billion a year from French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What electrical engineer would order an EPR designed to work for sixty years if it was planned to close its manufacturer?
To solve the energy equation, it is necessary to recognize that there are no divine or diabolical sources of energy production.
Areva’s development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the reciprocity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest level of security for nuclear energy is undoubtedly a vital issue.
In France, we have a security body that carries out uncompromising and transparent control of existing energy centres such as Flamandville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is generally recognized, are full of the same obsession with security.
For 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents.
Only one, Tri-Mil Island, occurred under normal operating conditions, but without any impact on the human or the environment.
In Chernobyl, the device of the reactor and the unforgivable human error led to tragedy.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident occurred as a result of two natural disasters of unprecedented power, which resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will draw lessons from this accident, as it has drawn from the previous two.
The result of this step and cooperation between the security authorities, operators and French and German designers, EPR, is a project to counter such phenomena.
As it is considered by all energy specialists who want to build a reactor, stopping its construction in Flamandville will be a great gift to competitors Areva and EDF, clearing them the way to gain leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear energy.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best combination of energy sources for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow the emotions, dogmas and planned maneuvers to culminate in a dispute that is so important to our country’s economic, social and financial situation.
Is immigration a burden or a benefit to the economy?
Immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various sides – overloading police, judiciary and administrative services subject to the policy of numbers and compatibility of this policy with France’s self-proclaimed status as a “state of human rights”.
Then there was administrative harassment of foreign students, which came into the news when the Minister of the Interior (Liberason of May 23) said that France "does not need foreign talents, pebbles and waiters."
It is rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
The left and right sides agree on this.
On the right side, the tone was set by Jacques Chirac, who said in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed will not be a problem in a country with 2 million foreign workers", and on the left side, Michel Rocher, who explained in 1990 that France "can't accept the poor from around the world."
The difference is only in generosity.
In 2005, the fear of invading the country was felt by the Polish water liners, both the left and the right.
Both sides see immigration as a burden for the French economy and for French society.
The difference is only in the level of generosity they will allow for immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande confined himself to banalities, saying that “to work together will solve our immigration problem.”
This view of immigration as a burden and a problem can give an electoral advantage, but economically it is very expensive.
As the economists Ian Goldin and Jeffrey Cameron reminded us in a recent book, which summarized the latest data on immigration (Special People: How migration has shaped our world and will determine our future, the economy of May 2011), which is the basis of the economy, the publishing of the Princeton University, the specialty of 352.
Restriction of immigration leads to weakening growth and declining employment.
Fears of immigrant influence are based on the notion that they are capable of replacing local workers, especially low-skilled, by provoking a reduction in wages.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are supplementing much more than replacing the local workforce by doing jobs for which local workforce is lacking.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local workforce, and the most skilled ones work in dynamic sectors where training is not linked to job offers.
Positive impact on salaries
Just as it would be difficult for a surgeon to work in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, the interconnection between locals and immigrants leads to the fact that the arrival of immigrants positively affects the wages of local workers.
Giovanni Perry estimates that a 1% increase in migration flows leads to a 0.6-0.9% increase in real long-term wages.
And this does not take into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of new ideas and economic growth (among American Nobel laureates, a large proportion of naturalized immigrants, and Google, Intel, Paypal and Yahoo - all were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also bring net profits to social security systems, giving an average of 1% of the total budgets of European countries.
According to the World Labour Organization, for example, in Germany, an immigrant who arrives at the age of 30 will bring a net profit (income minus expenses) of an average of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150,000 to the state budget for his life.
At the beginning of his mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy was going to stick with his "tooth" to the missing growth points.
The mentioned teeth, which were used to scare away immigrants, gave the exact opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, it remains to understand European democracy.
Democracy is a valuable acquisition; but at the same time fragile.
The European continent must remember that, when invented in Athens more than two thousand years ago, in the twentieth century he survived the tragedies of World War I, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, Gulag, as well as Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the regiments.
Some believed that for democracy to finally conquer its enemies, it was enough to hold a vote and make it as direct as possible.
Since Napoleon’s time the “Little” is known to have come from the surface of thought.
General voting, although a mandatory condition for democracy, is not a sufficient condition for it and can even become a “instrument of repression,” as Republican philosopher Etienne Vasro once said.
No, democracy demands much more – public space, public spirit, values, organization, division and control of governments, education, education, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The European crisis we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is primarily a political crisis and a crisis of democracy.
In this regard, the palinody of the true-false Greek referendum will have a double clarification effect, demonstrating both the need for serious policy change and the unpleasant sense of its impossibility and inconsistency.
This duality needs to be understood in order to overcome it.
The truth is that the frontline of the struggle for democracy has now shifted and, in the opinion of many, Republican soldiers are now aiming in the wrong direction.
We will not win anything by demanding a series of national referendums, organized as necessary and chaoticly.
"Cart-blanch" for an absolute European monarch or jumping with tied legs in the fall of nationalism - what a choice for a citizen!
No, we are not dreaming of a guillotine blade, but of a joint, clear and continuous implementation of choice and democracy, this time at the pan-European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and it is unknown how many more will have to be listed, because there is only one crisis - the crisis of Europe.
The whole of Europe is completely subject to the dictatorship of markets and rating agencies, suffering from its weakness and lack of solidarity.
The whole of Europe is completely humiliated on the international stage.
Many are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but the whole of Europe is gradually losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
It is urgent to restore the management of the European project under popular sovereignty.
Because it is only by working together that Europeans will be able to reduce everyone’s debt burden, get rid of the markets and prepare for the future by investing in it.
Outcome from the crisis will require decisions at a pan-European level, and they cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy without leading us to disaster.
After a long discussion of this proposal, the Socialists and Jacques Delors all now demand the European economic government.
Let's do it.
But to imagine it without a stronger economic, political and democratic integration, which has come to pass, is another madness and a new stop.
We need to start a new phase of European construction.
To establish a republic in France, it was necessary to “create” Republicans.
A revolution of interest would not be enough.
This lesson remains in force.
We must build a Europe that is economically unified.
This can only be done by creating a more democratic Europe at the political level, a true people’s European sovereignty.
To create Europe, let’s create Europeans.
Contactless chip cards are becoming more and more common.
The World Chip Card Exhibition opens on Tuesday in Villepinte under Paris in an atmosphere of optimism.
In fact, 2011 will end with a 11% increase in global microprocessor sales (banking cards, phones with SIM cards), exceeding, according to Eurosmart, 6 billion units.
The most important is the non-contact technology sector, which allows you to pay for public transport or purchases by simply carrying a map over a reader.
This year, 460 million contactless chip cards will be sold worldwide versus 320 million a year earlier!
Their share will increase in 2012 (580 million units are expected) and make up almost 10% of the world's chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe, which has long been behind the Asia-Pacific region, is now advancing in the field of contactless payments.
Approximately 26 million Visa bank cards are already provided with this feature, and they are accepted by 75,000 terminals.
France is starting from a more modest position: 400,000 contactless Visa cards are in circulation.
But big stores are growing at a pace.
This year, Carrefour released 2.5 million contactless MasterCard Passes.
To move to a higher speed, it is necessary for banks to supply their customers’ equipment.
“Two large organizations in France have promised in the future to systematically distribute to their customers bank cards adapted for contactless use,” said Gerard Nebouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing payments using a mobile phone.
But this is only the first stage of the development of the future payment method, i.e. the mobile phone.
So far, only a few devices are equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology necessary to carry out such transactions.
“They were postponed.
"But they're really going to take off next year."
“We expect global sales of 80 million to 120 million units in 2012,” explains Mark Berten, head of Eurosmart.
Banks are moving forward.
Yesterday, Crédit Agricole announced that it will conduct an experiment from December to June next year in Cannes.
Approximately 200 iPhone customers and employees will be equipped with shells that provide contactless payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société Générale also said yesterday that it is preparing to launch an offer that allows its customers to pay via mobile phones.
Terrorist Front Spreads from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the links of the Islamic Maghreb with the Boko Haram sect.
Long-time alleged links between the Al-Qaeda terrorist group in the Muslim Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram have been confirmed.
On Sunday, the Deputy Foreign Minister of Algeria, Abdelkader Messahel, even said that the Algerians are now confident of this.
“The way these two organizations are using it, and the reports of the secret services show that they are actively cooperating,” he explained, without giving in to the details.
Paris seems to have come to similar conclusions.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger in January revealed two linkages.
The kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by people close to Aqmi, Antoine de Leocourt and Vincent Delori were apparently killed the next day along with several of the kidnappers during an operation carried out by French special forces.
Among the remains of the operation, French and Nigerian investigators found several phone SIM cards belonging to the terrorists.
This is terror.
The analysis of the calls made indicated several interlocutors in Mali, Nigeria and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in two numbers; one indicates a Nigerian who lived long in Maidiguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the coffin of Boko Haram, and the other - a person allegedly close to Aqmi and a sect.
“It’s a step forward, but we certainly have to wait for more reliable evidence before we talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram.”
"But it's possible."
“For many years it has been known that the sect is receiving financial and ideological support from outside and that it is becoming more and more active,” said Kunle Amuvo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, this support has become increasingly evident by the actions and statements of Boko Haram and its methods, which now include the use of deadly and increasingly complex explosive devices of the same type that Aqmi uses.
The international community led by Washington is now putting pressure on Abuja to pay attention to the problems that Boko Haram creates.
The fact is that the Nigerian authorities have traditionally viewed this group as a community of educated people who are not of interest.
Rapid Successes
Founded in 2002 in Maidiguri at a mosque, school, and under the imam foundationalist Muhammad Yusuf, Boko Haram – which means “Western education is sin” – preaches the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the organization has achieved rapid success.
It is politicized and demands strict adherence to the Sharia, and its activists have begun to fight against the evil central government.
It is mainly aimed at churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active in carrying out numerous attacks on police stations.
Abuja's reaction, as usual, is uncompromising.
The army blockaded the city and left 800 dead.
Muhammad Yusuf, taken alive, was killed in prison.
Now the sect is radicalizing and will go beyond its northern borders.
Last Christmas, she took responsibility for the action that killed 80 people in Josh, and then another one in Abuja.
In June in Abuja, Boko Haram organized the first attack of the killer on a fortified police headquarters.
In August, the local mission of the United Nations will be their first international goal.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which goes from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, is now worrying for all security experts.
Today, when Aqmi has strengthened in Mali and Niger, and Somalis from al-Shabaab are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram poses a new threat to the continent.
Last week, during a conversation with President Goodlack, Allen Juppé warned of the dangers of Boko Haram and expressed his willingness to share all the information available.
The world, as Republican presidential candidates see it
With regard to China, Iran and aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane and Rick Perry are competing in simplification and incompetence.
Can America, weakened by the crisis, lead a complex world with simple, more precisely, simplistic ideas?
If you listen to presidential candidates from Republicans, voters might believe it.
For several days, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane, Rick Perry and others have been multiplying loud, but deprived of the details of the foreign policy statement, which has traditionally been a stronghold of Republicans.
The slogans concerning China, Iran and aid to Israel are often confused with each other.
Mitt Romney, who has the best chance of being promoted from the “Old Good Party,” threatened to file a complaint against the Chinese to the WTO and accuse them of “manipulating their currency” is a sensitive topic for America, irritated by the migration of entire industries in its industry.
Even worse, if it leads to a trade war, he said.
John Huntsman, Obama’s former ambassador to China and the only candidate in a complex foreign policy, has not been able to fight a position that strikes emotions.
He called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama’s current position).
But Huntsman, who holds the bottom of the rankings, remained unheard.
Reagan's style
Romney also promised military strikes against Iran if sanctions could not stop his nuclear program.
"If I'm elected, I'll stop Iran," he said.
“If Obama is re-elected, they will have a bomb.”
He also pledged to increase military assistance to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to keep his promises to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Kane, the second candidate in the ranking, has demonstrated discouraging ignorance of the cases.
He recently called for the Chinese military to resist the threat because Beijing is trying to gain nuclear power, apparently not knowing that China has owned it since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and seeks military strikes on Iran, says he is ready to use the U.S. military in Mexico against drug cartels.
Recourse to torture suspects in terrorism banned by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Kane, Perry and candidate Michel Bahman.
All of this is very far from the 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, the heavyweight of foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president say Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They remind me that Obama himself was a fan and that he had to reduce the tone in the fight against terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, on the premature withdrawal of the “boys” from Iraq, his tricks in Libya that brought him the reputation of a weak politician.
But the offensive isn't that easy.
The population considers a positive balance of national security with Obama, who eliminated Ben Laden.
After Iraq, it does not believe in military interventions that are tied to the sand.
And, claiming that America needs to be rebuilt economically to revive its leadership, Obama is right.
North Stream, new gates for the entry of Russian gas into Europe.
The North Stream, connecting Western Europe and Russia directly at the bottom of the Baltic Sea, is launched.
It is intended to supply gas to the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, a Russian giant gas producer, wanted to celebrate this event with a pump.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, took part last Tuesday on the Baltic coast, between the performance of the orchestra and refined snacks, in the opening of the North Stream, a new gas pipeline that directly connects Russia and Germany underwater.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch colleague, Mart Rutte, have jointly returned a symbolic valve that controls the inflow of Russian gas into Western Europe.
According to the new pipeline, 27.5 million additional cubic meters of gas will arrive in Western Europe each year on the first 1,224 km long pipeline connecting the Leningrad region with the land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
The second pipeline is expected to be ready at the end of 2012, providing a total supply of 55,000 million cubic meters of gas equivalent to all of France’s consumption.
And the possibility of building a third pipeline in the same direction is already discussed.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge project is a victory.
The project met with the fierce resistance of Poland and the Baltic States.
The North Stream will actually allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding passing through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
These two countries will lose some of their power: they will find it harder to influence Russia, threatening to shut down access to Western European markets.
At the most tense moment of the debate, Warsaw did not stop comparing the North Stream with the new "German-Soviet Pact", suggesting an alliance between Hitler and Stalin in order to occupy Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically sensitive.
By supporting this Russian project, Western Europe is seeking greater security of its supplies.
But at the cost of depriving Europe of energy, because the project created a gap between Eastern and Western Europe.
In less than five years, Russia has managed to achieve its understanding of the direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries that consume large amounts of gas and whose own reserves are already on the rise.
“This gas pipeline is part of cooperation with Russia, it’s a new artery that organically binds us,” Fillon said, opening the pipeline, demonstrating to what extent large gas contracts are important both politically and economically.
All this explains the wide smiles on the faces of the heads of Gazprom, who were present in large numbers in Liebmin, the point of arrival of gas.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also a technical step.
The underwater pipeline is made of steel enclosed in concrete to protect it from ship anchors.
It lies at the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 meters.
To build it, it was necessary to circumvent the mining fields that had remained since World War II.
“The dog had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution,” said Jens Mueller, a North Stream press secretary.
It was also necessary to take many steps to protect the fauna and flora.
The pipeline is a long metal snake weighing equal to the weight of 242 Eiffel Towers, without breaks throughout its length, without valves and without service stations.
The control platform was planned in the area of Sweden, but the project managers abandoned it because Sweden was not thrilled that the Russian state company would live on its shores forever.
“In the event of an accident, we will interrupt the flow of gas in less than a minute,” says Jens Mueller.
So in case of leakage, the gas contained in the gas pipeline will go into the air.
But this seems unlikely to designers who designed seams, calculated to run only once every 100,000 years.
The state of the gas pipeline will be monitored by an underwater robot that pulls the ship, for external monitoring, as well as an apparatus circulating inside the gas pipeline.
The cigarette-shaped apparatus is inserted into the pipeline with a diameter of 1 meter and pushed forward by the flow of gas.
Upon arrival after 3 full days of travel at a speed of 3 meters per second it gives accurate information about any metal deformation.
The gas pipeline has been designed to operate for 50 years without the need for the slightest repair.
The circulation of the gas is carried out only by its pressure.
It is 200 bars on departure and 100 bars on arrival.
Five companies have combined efforts to implement this project.
The leader is Gazprom, which owns 51% of its capital.
The rest are German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), Dutch Gasunie and French Group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies created a joint venture called North Stream, which was commissioned to build and operate a gas pipeline.
Its headquarters are in Zürich, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased the company for twenty years with the possibility of extending the entire volume of transport of gas.
“Gazprom will pay for the full volume, no matter how much gas will actually be transported,” says Jens Mueller.
The construction of the gas pipeline was financed by 30% by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the work will be 7.4 thousand million euros for two pipelines.
GDF Suez’s investment will be around 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that they will pay their expenses because Gazprom takes all the risks.
The gas pipeline comes from the Baltic Sea in Ljubmin on a sandy shore, planted by soft trees.
The 4.5-metre-high valves form the exhaust gas terminal.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas before it is transferred to German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives one million cubic meters of gas every hour.
At full capacity it will be 3 million per hour, and in 2012 it will be 6 million.
Branded Moleskine Notebook
Moleskine, created by the Italian company fifteen years ago, will return the taste to the letter.
It has a scent of adventures, hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easy to identify by a rectangular black cover, by rubber, by yellow-white pages, as if desired over time.
However, the Moleskine notebook, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, has decided to launch design notebooks for sale.
Maria Sebregondi, the company’s then consultant, took responsibility for the launch of the new product.
The notebook is inspired by the old production technique, the moleskin - lacquered cotton fabric, used, for example, to cover the rockets.
It is claimed that this type of notebook is highly appreciated by writers and travellers.
“Moleskine has brought an old and forgotten thing in line with today’s taste that was a cult for avant-garde artists until the 20th century,” said Maria Sebregondi, who has since become a managing brand in Modo Modo.
Success has arrived.
From 2006 to 2010, sales increased by 25% and reached 12.7 million units.
We went a long way from the first years of production, when only 3,000 notebooks were produced.
Moleskine has crossed the borders of Italy and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
Setting up a profile of a typical buyer is difficult, because the notebook equally attracts a businessman, a student and a person of free profession.
Moleskine buyers are cosmopolitan, have broad views and are educated.
The small Italian company, which initially had only 12 employees, now has 100 and two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
It distributes its notebooks in Fnac bookstores, shops in the centers of small cities and has been able to gain widespread popularity.
“We followed the spirit of time and this new need in the letter despite the emergence of e-mail,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This distinctive cultural feature accompanies the development of Moleskine; the brand recently organised an exhibition "The Circular Path", where architects and artists showed their own notes.
In August, he also launched covers with a leopard drawing on the occasion of the film festival in Locarno.
Using its success and cultural aura, Moleskine has diversified its products, which now include bags, handles, computer bags. The brand includes all kinds of support.
Success that gave rise to jealousy: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was purchased by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, which added a new page to the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate among disabled workers so high?
Approximately 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week of employment for people with disabilities begins today.
Despite the public charitable policy launched in 2005, the unemployment rate among people with disabilities is still twice as high as the average, namely 19 per cent versus 9 per cent for the general population.
Discouragement?
“No,” said Eric Blanche, the Director General of Adapt, an organization that organizes a Week of Disabled Employment.
"In 15 years we will have made significant progress."
“At that time, the unemployment rate was not two, but three times higher.”
“There is still a lot of work ahead.”
It should be said that there are still many barriers to employment for the disabled.
Among them are older: 37% over the age of 50 (17% on average).
They have a rather low level of qualification: 80% do not have a bachelor’s degree, and out of 2.3 million higher education students only 10,000 disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very common, which is 85% for people with disabilities versus 38% on average.
In short, these are all criteria that make it very difficult to get back to work and that are the essence of the problem,” said Christian Grapen, CEO of Tremplin, an association established in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
Here are some of the obstacles.
There is no need to talk about a mentality that is changing, but too slow.
The study, conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprendre Association on behalf of the Cité, found that the managers surveyed had a low level of knowledge about disability and “represented solid people in wheelchairs either mentally or mentally disabled.”
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from the goal of having 6% of disabled workers, as set out in the law adopted in 1987.
The latest known figures, dating back to 2008, represent 2.6%.
“Today we are about 3%,” says Pierre Blan, CEO of Agefiph, the organization responsible for tax collection from companies that do not comply with this law.
Evidence: The number of "taxable" organizations, as well as the amounts paid, decreased in 2007-2011 from 59,000 to 46,000 organizations (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
“The 2005 law that raised the tax created a lot of pressure on the company,” explains Pierre Blan.
“But this improvement also reflects the increase in awareness, particularly in large enterprises.”
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of organizations with 20 to 49 employees have disabled workers versus 82% of organizations with 100 to 199 employees.
Azar: "What happiness"
Before fighting the Blues on Tuesday evening (20:45) Eden Azar and George Leekens did not hide the pleasure they received from this friendly match.
We will not come to claim that there was a secret conspiracy between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting next to the stadium, Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Azar agreed.
Five months after his attacker's appearance in the match against Turkey, the Belgian coach can only praise him.
“I’m very pleased with Eden, with his promotion and the fact that he’s Belgian.”
"I want to go further," said Lillian.
As for the contrast between his achievements in the club and in the team, that’s one thing, he justifies.
“I’m in Lille all year, but I’m not in Belgium.”
“I have to earn my glasses.”
Left in stock, ahead of this match against France, in a game against Romania on Friday night, Azar came to Saint-Denis to finally "brighten".
Not to mention, however, the concept of “pleasure”.
He has supported the Blues since the age of 7 and the winning campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always supported them, he confirms.
This, of course, also reinforces the special character of this match.
And especially that on the other side are Matie (Debushi), Yohan (Kabe) and Adil (Rami),” he recalls.
“Our roads just crossed.”
“To be able to play against them is pure happiness.”
Leekens kindly remembered the "prosperity".
"Proud" to play a "festival match".
"Pride" also claims as a "neighbor" that France "re-became a very high-level team" just a year after the injury in Naissance.
“Lauren Blan was like a thunderstorm, he admires.
Now that Belgium misses the next Euro, the technical athlete will fly on a blue-guided plane to Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgian people are growing up," he said.
“We’re building something, the players are ambitious, they’re hungry.”
"You'll see to it in future matches, including this against France."
Portugal is very confident in itself.
Portugal’s Paulo Bento starts his match against Bosnia (22.00) on Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
On the way to him, both teams seemed to lose a sense of reality.
“At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country.”
Paula Bentu already sees himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him there is no doubt that the team he has run since September 2010 will qualify for Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there is a match to be played, and Bosnia has to be won.
With 0-0 on Friday in hell, it is clear that the game is not over.
Although Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, it failed to achieve the goal that would reassure her.
"It's a good result, which, however, involves a certain risk."
But at their brightly illuminated stadium in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, in the eyes of the public, which should be excited, although the match will be very tense," - said optimistic, but reasoned.
“We expect a very tense game, but we are convinced that we can win,” said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
“We still have a 50% chance of being in the Euro 2012,” said Karlush Kairosh’s successor.
No one on Friday in the match against Bosnia demands a victory from the Portuguese.
No one could have killed the Bosnians.
"It's a good result, but there's some risk," Bentu said.
"We will play against a team that has a lot of technical advantages and players who have a lot of individual advantages," he added.
As was already in Zenica, the Portuguese are going to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians from the very beginning, "don't give them time to think".
It's a good idea, if only this time it would be realistic.
