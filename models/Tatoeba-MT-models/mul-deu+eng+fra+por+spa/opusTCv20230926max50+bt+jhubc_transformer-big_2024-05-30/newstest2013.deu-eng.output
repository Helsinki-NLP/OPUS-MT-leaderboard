A Republican strategy to counter Obama’s re-election
The Republican leaders justify their policies with the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter to be a myth, affirming that election fraud in the United States is less common than the number of people killed by the lightning strike.
Republican lawyers have only recorded 300 cases of electoral fraud in the U.S. in 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on electoral participation.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for conducting elections in the individual states.
In this sense, the majority of U.S. governments have been enacting new laws since 2009 that make it difficult to register or enter.
This phenomenon has gained significance after the November 2010 elections, which allowed 675 new Republican representatives to be registered in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills were introduced in 2011 alone, restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID and a proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten the periods for early voting, invalidate the right to register as an elector on the day of the election, and grant citizens the right to vote for which a court act exists.
Before the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to raise such a claim.
In 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of the Indiana law.
The Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have promoted bills in 34 states, forcing voters to present a photo ID.
It is important to note that U.S. citizens, unlike Quebec, do not have a universal identification card like the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, i.e. 21 million eligible people, do not have a photo ID issued by a government authority in their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a passport.
However, it is often necessary to pay more than a hundred dollars to get the required passport.
Young people, minorities and low-income people are disproportionately affected by the new restrictions.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people with incomes of less than <0x24>35,000, 18% of citizens aged 65 and 20% of voters aged 18-29 do not have the required photo ID.
This is more than enough.
Students considered to be voters who vote for democratic candidates are not allowed to use their photo ID issued by their institution in several states.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting associations who vote more strongly for the Republican side to use the cards issued by these associations for elections.
Before 2004, no state required a proof of citizenship for the election.
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a claim.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove their U.S. citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting Hispanic votes.
It is obvious that two out of three Spanish voters prefer the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers in 2011 passed laws in eight states that abolished the registration of voters on election day.
In addition, you have restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to those voters who wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, campaigns to register voters in the 2004 general election have helped register about 10 million citizens.
Since the measures adopted since 2009, the share of new voter registration in 2010 has decreased by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers in five other states have passed laws aimed at shortening the period for early voting.
For example, in the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were African-Americans, although they accounted for only 13% of the state’s voters.
The same applies to the Spanish population.
The latter accounted for only 11% of the voters, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, the whites, which accounted for 76% of the voters, accounted for only 46% of the voters who voted in advance.
Of course, the democratic legislators and their supporters have vigorously opposed the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Several bills were blocked by the vetos of democratic governors.
The U.S. Attorney General has intervened to derogate the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
However, the newly introduced rules will undoubtedly make it difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics applaud the party-political nature of the laws adopted and see in them as a clear goal the influence of the results in the decisive states for 2012.
A 2011 report by the Brennan Center shows that those states that have passed these laws make up 171 of the 270 votes required in the electorate to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes to the legislation on the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on electoral participation.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Early detection of prostate cancer: should the test be done or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes shows incorrect results, with false negative or also false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to stronger hesitations of the already indecisive men for carrying out early detection tests.
Should the test be done or not?
We received the opinion of two specialists.
In the studies conducted in the United States, there were numerous disruptive factors between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret this data and make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that there is a difference in the mortality rate of patients with and without early detection.
This study has also shown that after 12 years of follow-up, the likelihood of metastasis formation is 30 to 40% higher if no early detection has been performed.
Therefore, I recommend the test from 50 years of age or 40 years of age if you have a direct relative who has already had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American descent are also at a higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision once a cancer has been diagnosed.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The extent of the risk of his cancer must be made truly understandable to the patient by showing him the possible options in which prostate cancer can remain untreated if he does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases he is more likely to be an active one for the crane.
Today, there is no treatment in many men who have been diagnosed with cancer, as their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to their lives.
They are advised to be actively monitored and offered treatment when the disease progresses.
Increasingly, the criteria for deciding who should and who should not be dealt with are determined.
Therefore, I recommend that the test be carried out.
The most important thing, however, is to talk to your doctor to determine if he should be performed or not.
In collaboration with the International Society for Urology, Movember has developed an instrument to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no cure for cancer.
Despite progress in research, adopting a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of getting sick with it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone eats well and moves sufficiently.
“If there were no more smokers, this value would rise to at least 50%,” said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is assumed that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Many remain completely unclear as well.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It seriously damages people’s health.
"There are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today," said spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after quitting cigarettes, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, overweight and obesity also promote the outbreak of the disease.
They appear to increase the risk of breast, intestine, colon, esophagus, pancreatic and cervical cancer.
“Research shows that regular physical activity protects against bowel cancer throughout life,” he adds.
The Nutrition
The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In excessive amounts, it increases the risk of developing a Grimm or mast cancer.
Salts should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salts can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
“The latter can damage the body cells and lead to the development of cancer,” he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have investigated the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their investigations are not conclusive at the moment.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study found a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly demonstrated.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu stresses how important it is to talk to his doctor about his concerns and his family preoccupation.
"Performing an early detection test does not lead to cancer."
The Higgs Boson analyzed
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs Boson has sparked some excitement last summer, and for good reason.
In fact, it is believed that this boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it is the last particle whose existence is predicted from the standard model - our best or "the least wrong" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - but has not yet been observed empirically.
But for physicists, it is not yet completely certain that it is really the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle, and that it is very similar to the Higgs-Boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented at a major physics conference in Kyoto this week, but data is still lacking to be completely certain.
Nevertheless, let’s assume that it’s actually the Higgs, as there seems to be only a small risk of being fooled, and let’s look at what’s going on.
There is a law in this world that is necessarily inevitable, which causes two objects not to be present at the same place at the same time.
It is not possible to break this rule - and don't try it too hard as you will hurt yourself.
For even if particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that such a law applies to them as well: Pauli's principle of exclusion, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quantum state" and if they are in the same "quantum state", and if they are in the same state, they are in their best condition.
Based on this, physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In a corner are the good citizens, who are called Fermione and politely obey the Pauli principle.
And on the other hand, the Bosons move, an evil gang of anarchists, to whom nothing is sacred – certainly not this principle, which means that they can actually be in the same place at the same time.
According to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratories (which is absolutely amazing by the way) these bosons are divided into two groups: the mesons that we are not going to treat here and the "power particles" through which the great forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs boson is somehow confused.
But it must be stressed here that these bosons are not all as exotic creatures as one might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, then only thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon or the "particle of light", which is the "bot" of electromagnetic force.
In other words, if a particle accelerates with an electric charge or changes the direction, the electromagnetic field is "disturbed" precisely in this place, in a manner like a pebble thrown into a pond.
This "disruption" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and thus one of the boson "carriers of force".
Stable field
The same goes for the Higgs Boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, has to be "disturbed" to show this boson.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the trigger must reach very high energies, somewhat similar to a frozen pond, whose surface could only be shattered by a very large rock.
That’s why a huge particle accelerator like CERN is required – the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a circumference of 27 km! – to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful in explaining the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others don’t – for example, a sheet of paper would never keep itself in the refrigerator.
And equally, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do have a mass, while the others (like the photon) do not have a mass.
What can all this research be “good” for now, asks Mrs. Plamondon?
For science, they are used to check the standard model (SM), and they also allow physicists to carefully examine all the deviations between the observations and predictions of the SM.
By the way, there are many physicists who eagerly hope that such deviations will be found, since the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and stop some holes in the model.
It must be said that the latter still has major flaws as it does not provide an explanation for the gravity (ups!) and the dark matter that makes up about 80% of the matter of the universe (again ups!).
However, such deviations have not been found at CERN so far.
Consequences
The impact of these researches on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that it does not exist.
By the way, in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell laboratories did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the deceased physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs where the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who even in 1962 developed the first permanent strip laser (the first were pulsed) - has already been said that the laser was seen at the beginning rather than a "Labor game."
Just imagine...
In addition, applications can also result from all the instruments surrounding the research.
For example, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969 during his work in optics.
Although it was not the original purpose, today this sensor serves all digital cameras around the world as an "eye" and was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily change our lives, but it does mean that one can never really know...
Palliative care - the best way to die... <0x7C> Le Devoir
With its Committee on "Death in Dignity", Quebec recently discussed the delicate question of the living.
The debate must be resumed shortly, although a bill is being prepared.
However, there is still much to be done in this important area.
Le Devoir has tried to take a closer look at this.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that took him up had given him a two-year term.
"They gave me five years to live, I managed seven years," he said half-heartedly, lying in his bed in the palliative care home of Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he had arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for it," he says.
The disease does its job: an immense weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating himself.
Sitting at the table before a delicious lunch, he resigns to let himself be helped with the meal.
Courageously, he even manages to smile and talk to the strangers who are busy around him, bring him his medicines, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
“My biggest wish is that you cure my diarrhea because it’s humiliating,” he said.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
“Over the course of our lives, we learn that a man is pinching while standing,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois’ home.
Returning to childhood is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"It depends on the person's ability to take a step back," he notes.
Because in the opinion of several people working in palliative care, major events take place amid these retreats.
Patients who are admitted to the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, they are no longer overwhelmed by the doctors and nurses who take care of them with so-called "healing" care.
For Ms. A., 89, the worst fear is to die "consciously and by drowning".
But because of the disease, I really got to know my children.
“I have good children,” she adds.
“I don’t have any desires in life anymore,” she says before accepting that you put on a mask that helps you breathe.
In the next few days, she is still waiting for the last visit of her son, who comes from Italy.
In the Victor-Gadbois home, a group of volunteers are offered body care and assistance in eating.
Palliative care is used when there are no other options.
To make death more enjoyable.
In Quebec, there is a palliative care bed for 11,700 people.
This is very little given that one day we will all die.
Here, life continues under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
At the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying person is given oral care with brandy or pepsi, depending on their preference.
Diabetics no longer need to control their blood sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Yesterday evening we served Mr. X a beer that died in the course of the night.
This morning his son will drink the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We are helping relatives and patients equally," says Nursing Director Nathalie Savard.
In Victor Gadbois, there is no day like the other.
In addition to an old man of 93 years who enjoys the last family reunion in the yard and is well supported by his head pillows, while attacking to his honour, a young man of 36 years dies, who has passed away from his parents, his wife and his two little children.
“For six months, three to five beds have always been covered with cancer patients under the age of 45,” says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients admitted to the Victor Gadbois home come from their home, 47% from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, i.e. to a care that is intended to alleviate the suffering of patients when they have reached the final stage of their life, either at home, in a hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois Home and the Society for Home Palliative Care in the Greater Montreal area, are more or less exclusively specialized in the care of cancer patients.
It is this great inadequacy in Quebec’s health care that makes it possible for several doctors specializing in palliative care to take care of the passing of a law to regulate death aid and assisted suicide with concern.
Since October, a manifesto has been circulating, signed by prominent palliative care figures such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe to express their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not powerful enough to ensure that everyone has the right to high-quality palliative care before accepting to switch to death care.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who had been in the emergency room with great pain for 14 days without taking measures to relieve her.
I fear that the patients just want to die because they don’t get adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients, despite the worst prognosis, to the last day.
Hélène Richard’s chances of survival were already minimal when she cancelled a troublesome chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was going to stop the treatment, she told me she regretted giving up the fight.
However, she told me that I was in the end!
No Omnipotent Care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die thank the nursing staff for not fulfilling this wish after their pain has been relieved by a palliative care team.
It must be said, however, that palliative care is not omnipotent in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, head of the home palliative care company of the Montreal area, 8% of patients don’t talk about pain treatment.
Thus, at the end of life, doctors often resort to terminal sedation, which leads to either sporadically or permanently sleeping the patient until the time of his death.
We can no longer act as if we do not perceive this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the opportunity to resort to this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not relieved all say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that doesn’t necessarily mean, “I want you to fall asleep,” but “I want my pain to be relieved.”
Implementation of this report was possible due to a journalism scholarship from Canadian health research institutes.
Real estate scandals on a large scale in Quebec
Officers of the Road Construction Officer, companies of the main construction industry, fundraisers of political parties and specialists of the Italian Mafia tell every day what they know about a great "system" in which construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafiosos are entangled.
An "industry" that was very expensive for the taxpayer of Quebec, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
“It’s strange how the system has collapsed since drastic measures were taken,” said Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former head of police in Montreal.
The scandal was uncovered due to an in-depth investigation into the allegations related to the Quebec road construction contracts, which the then Prime Minister had only voted against.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and the bribery of officials.
"Since the investigation began in 2010," he stressed, "only the Department of Transportation would have saved a billion dollars on the contracts," because some were leaning their instincts to get their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already sued two mayors," he adds, hoping that it will be able to show "the tactics behind the individuals".
An anti-corruption permanent unit launched in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit, which was established in 2011, also undertakes great efforts with its troops of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the police of the "Marteau Troop", which since 2009 has made Montreal's "canalisation cartel" more reluctant in the artificial inflation of the contracts...
In recent weeks, she has carried out house searches and raised allegations of fraud and corruption against municipal officials such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, who is the mayor of a suburb.
The next on the list would be Gilles Villancourt, who had just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, the third largest city in Quebec.
He is suspected of repeatedly receiving lubricants in exchange for public contracts.
The charges were explicitly filed by engineers from the Montreal Road Construction Office, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter has raised awareness by explaining to the Commission the functioning of the "system" for the award of public contracts.
For several years, he himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to a mediator associated with the Mafia, who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
In the 2000s, Mr. Zambito had his hand in play everywhere, giving more than <0x24>88,000 (about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>68,000) to provincial parties, especially to the liberals who were in power at the time.
He also admitted to organizing an illegal acquisition of funds for former Liberal Vice President Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewerage contracts, the costs of which were artificially inflated by him
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
Former construction engineer Gilles Surprenant described this in detail before the Commission: in ten years, he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribery money in the amount of <0x24>736,000 in compensation for the canalisation.
Other road construction officials have admitted that they lubricated themselves by artificially inflating the bills with false additional benefits by 30-40%.
In addition, a party organizer of the Mayor’s party, Martin Dumont, has accused Mr Tremblay of deliberately overlooking a shadow house that filled his cash boxes with black money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, which put Montreal in a severe crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first deputies in Montreal to strike an alarm.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district in the east of the island, she refused to sell a municipal property for <0x24>5 million and was resold to builders in the booming real estate market for <0x24>1.6 million.
70% black money in election campaigns
From the investigation, which is ultimately carried out, she says that it “draws on a thread that allows it to understand the functioning of the system undermined by ants to stop evil and inform the culprits.”
She says the procedure is “painful but positive.”
We are cleaning the wound, but we need a Montreal-only investigative unit, as well as supervision to prevent the return of questionable practices.
How to clean.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, notes that "officials have stolen several hundred million dollars", but above all, he is thinking about the role of "mandators who are in the picture about tactics" if they weren't involved in fraud!
Based on a share of 70% of black money in funding campaigns in Quebec, he tweeted, “I was told this is only a slight discrepancy of reality.”
The government of Quebec proposes to limit donations to parties to <0x24>100, which, according to him, would not change the situation: "As long as election spending is not strictly limited, black money will be in circulation in politics."
He recommends a complete revision of the system for the award of public contracts and the financing of the parties: “We cannot fall deeper; by courageously going to the ground, we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws.”
If this story damages the international reputation of Quebec and that of Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau urges those who laugh to take a look at their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you have taken on a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players have come.
Every day I make progress on your side.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
These elements motivate me to improve my level of play every day.
And in a game, this is even easier.
In football, everything goes very fast.
But I don't break out with enthusiasm.
From my beginnings in the centre of the preparatory training of the INF Clairefontaine to my playing time at Saint-Etienne, I have always progressed gradually.
They are therefore taking advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The new arrivals this summer are accustomed to playing games at very high levels.
You also know that every workout is crucial.
This means that a player like me has to offer the front and want to give his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my playing position.
He is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the job?
Of course I do.
Ancelotti respects all technicians.
There is currently no comparable person in Ligue 1 and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and has won many titles with respected clubs.
He had contact with great players.
I think he will win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
At the time, I had just recovered from a series of injuries.
The trust he has placed in me is also an explanation of my achievements.
What do you think of the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1 Lyon has taken us the place of the top rider.
But we're staying behind.
One of our most important goals is the Champions League: this is how we qualified for the eighth round.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, everything is possible.
However, we will have to speak our word against very good European teams.
First of all, we want to be the first of our group in front of Porto so that we can play the back of the eighth-final as a home game.
Can PSG become a major European club in the short term?
He already has the budget for it...
To become a big European club, Paris must win titles and make a name in the long run.
This is not the case today.
Financially, PSG is giving itself the means to take concrete forms of this project.
Would it be a great failure not to win the title in Ligue 1 as it was the case last season?
Of course, this would be a big disappointment.
This year, we really want to take this title.
Last season we were close to it.
In May, we were disappointed because we were strong enough to win.
We ended the season with a very strong performance.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, you should be a master with 79 points.
But another team, that of Montpellier, has achieved an even better season.
I think this year is the right one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are going to win the title, I think we have the stuff to win it.
Do you think the media expect too much from PSG?
Given what has been invested and the players we have, it’s normal to expect a lot from us.
We fully accept this.
However, if we win a home game against Troyes 4-0, and you still find something that can be challenged, that’s certainly a bit frustrating.
You wonder what people are still waiting for.
We could never win every weekend with 4-0.
We are not FC Barcelona.
We are trying to develop a game concept.
A team builds up over time.
In the Champions League, we have proven strong.
Take a look at Manchester City, a club that hasn’t qualified for the eighth-finals in two seasons, and has also made huge expenses!
With regard to the amounts invested, you were believed to be 15 points ahead of the game!
This meant that our opponents and the French championship would be ignored.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not good last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope we will be the smiling winners in the month of May and tell us that we have finally won them despite all the difficulties.
PSG seems completely dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s performance.
To make it so much better that we are talking about a "zlatan addiction".
That means Ibrahimovic is powerful and shoots many goals.
That's why he's here and he proves he's the star of Ligue 1.
Everywhere he has played, he’s kept in mind that he’s a great player and a world star.
Within the team, we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people around him.
What he has done is truly extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also enables everyone else to make progress.
How did you experience the 2012 European Championship with the French national team?
Like a disappointment.
It was in my heart to participate in this EM.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from losing some playing time.
I've seen things out there that I've come out of.
Today I am able to make good games in the national team.
This has been my hope since my baptism with the "Bleus".
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lessons, and today we need to set an exemplary attitude.
What do you think of the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Blue"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The national coach is strict, is close to the players and encourages to win.
Just like Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the EM.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the "Bleus" to Brazil.
Is the forced indecision (1:1) on October 16 in Spain a start-up game?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has made a commitment to everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never had a similar game in my career.
With Bitcoin it is possible to pay and sell without a bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between the parties involved.
Moreover, as so often in these technologies, a political vision is tangible: the belief that the current monetary system, designed by banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, the Bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros, etc.) as well as a protocol for safe exchange such as BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers in the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
A few thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After the price of Bitcoin reached a peak of <0x24>30 (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>23) in June 2011, it fell to <0x24>2 five months later before recovering to around <0x24>10 today (the rates are listed on bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to the world trade of real currencies or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
She describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success", "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as “credits” that are used to advance in a video game that you can win or buy through games (and sometimes even exchange back).
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, trade is monitored and processed every time by a central authority.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously account holders, auditors, money issuers as well as buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Any transaction between two users is actually carried out between two email addresses in the form of an email.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A series of data associated with this transaction is electronically signed by a dual encryption system.
In this way, the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Using the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the traded Bitcoins are present in the accounting book of public accounts distributed throughout the network.
The decisive step is to include this new transaction in this book.
This is done through a mathematical task that is started on the computers, with the winner, who is a kind of provisional central banker, having the privilege to add this additional line.
It is a fragment of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and unique electronic fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before the whole is "defeated".
The goal is to find the number that results in a special fingerprint (many zeroes at the beginning).
If this number has been found, the other nodes can easily check if it is the right one.
The transaction is thus permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay for scams twice very quickly (less than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other remains unlinked as both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the task gets 50 Bitcoins.
In order to prevent inflation, this reward is regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The bitcoins in circulation are thus limited to 21 million, but can be divided up to one hundred million units, which leaves a certain amount of room for play.
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased with each improvement in computing performance.
The life of the network has already had heights and depths.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin were attacked and the Bitcoin deposits were stolen.
“The vulnerability used does not concern the actual protocol,” assures Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced a paymium that is a real-money payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering using this anonymous service.
However, cash also has these shortcomings.
Important actors such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.
They are accepted by others like the WordPress blog platform.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel have analyzed the book of accounts and shown that almost 80% of Bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, a "mega-final sale" was launched.
“Three thousand dollars have been exchanged,” says Jon Holmquist, who works for the company Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book on this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions that are therefore cheaper.
In addition, the owner manages his/her identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system can be easily deployed by dealers, and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
You just need to enter an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by a phone, says Pierre Noizat, who assures that he has thousands of users.
There is a general trend in which hierarchical systems are covered in favor of more horizontally oriented systems.
“It will take some time for Bitcoin to be implemented, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicted.
The ECB, by the way, in its report, plans to reassess the various, today highly regarded risks in the event of a success of this currency.
We have withdrawn from Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops have left their responsibilities in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
The U.S. and NATO are expected to follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory, and for the Afghan people to decide their future without expecting everything from us.
In particular, we have punished Afghan farmers by treating them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 soldiers killed, as well as the wounded and wounded.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also farmers who refuse an armed foreign presence, as in the Soviet era.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even if they are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there when the western countries become more discreet.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the base in Nijrab, which I observed from a hill planted with almonds, financed by French loans, was done properly.
The truck and tank convoys overflowed by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
By the end of 2014, there will be no more Taliban in Kabul.
Since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996, the conditions have changed.
At that time, Kabul was empty and the country was covered by the struggles of the various rebel groups from the war.
Its takeover was considered a form of liberation and return to security.
Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of the peasants overwhelmed by al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved until today.
Former Mujahideen, the Afghan government and current Taliban have a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The most important figures of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They have turned into businessmen by confiscating government lands to sell them as a building land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from the massive U.S. sub-contracting.
They made a call, and most of them were not involved in the battles themselves.
As I heard in the campaigns, people want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, just like those who were able to take advantage of the American grants: the capital flight is considerable.
The young people are tired of the war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they had contact with the modern world and enjoyed their benefits.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is one-fifth of the total population.
In the cities, the state schools are full of girls like boys.
These young people, who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders, will have to provide jobs.
All, including the armed parties, are obsessed with mobile phones; television with its Turkish series, which represent a modern world, is being watched everywhere.
There is an army now.
Are the authorities under whose command they will be deemed to be legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already working to restore the militias in the province, which will escape the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of the mountains with strong local identities should have benefited from a certain decentralization in the example of the Western nations, but by the abolition of the office of the Prime Minister, which existed since the 1964 constitution, the United States wanted a centralized state with a strong presidency.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and has long been dependent on foreign aid.
Industries have not been rebuilt, functional dams are not present and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; except for fruits and vegetables, nothing is produced.
The private initiative will be given priority.
In a country that was founded by the Thirty Years’ War, a state control of the infrastructure would have been required.
The rumor has spread that Afghanistan occupies immense land treasures.
This adds to the impression that the Western countries were only in place to empower themselves.
Without energy to process the iron or copper ore on site, or without means of transport for an export over the mountains, mining is not possible.
The Chinese have almost left the copper mines of Mes Aynak, letting international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) do their excavations on the huge Buddhist site and remain the main employers of the province.
One day, it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports, to re-establish normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French combat troops was completed on November 20.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid: Girl and Young Gymnasiums, Institute of French at Universities, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support of the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service of "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was set up in 2012, has carried out numerous non-profit works and measures for the remediation of agriculture in dozens of mountain villages, and has been able to carry out "the richness and the openness of the French non-governmental organization" by a small community.
These works, which were required by many local workers, have helped to suppress the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increased agricultural land use.
What souvenirs do we give back after military spending of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2 billion?
A much more modest budget will help to improve local living conditions, which are often very hard in these valleys that are more than 2,000 meters high.
The embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural projects from municipalities in Kapisa province.
In order for farmers to free themselves from the insurrection led by foreign groups, which, according to their own statements, is their wish, the continuation would require less, more well-controlled and directly concerned civilian aid in their favor.
A Constitution with the Brick in Egypt
This is a new poker game by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt is more than ever divided in terms of the constitutional declaration, which temporarily grants him unlimited power, he has decided to put everything on a map.
To the surprise of all, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would adopt its final version the next day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State had granted this plenary two additional months for the completion of his work.
Egypt has now been relying on a provisional text, which has been amended several times for almost two years, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal conflict.
This new initiative has only resulted in an even stronger division of the country.
For his opponents, the president persists in his "autocratic delirium" by continuing to "break his word" and "right with feet".
On the sides of its supporters, it is assured that there is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to accelerate the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time forcing the brothers to give up their plans to explain the text to the Egyptians section by section.
It is also a way for the president to regain his public and democratic legitimacy while the protest is raging across the country.
According to confirmation in an interview with the American weekly Time, Mohammed Mursi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote be willingly.
For example, the Egyptian people with this retreat to a hasty vote will be given an ultimatum: "Either you vote for my draft, or I hold the unlimited power", the latter is supposed to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
85 mostly Islamist members of this constitutional assembly passed the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of liberals did not comply with the call.
Shortly before the constitutional declaration in mid-November, they turned their backs because they believe they have not been able to bring their views into effect.
Representatives of human rights organizations, religious minorities or civil society have acted equally.
In order to achieve decision-making, 11 people, deputy members, were added in a hurry yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising that the articles were mostly adopted unanimously.
By the way, the commentators found it entertaining that the only disagreement of the day... was expressed in the time of the prayer, as some members of the board were of the opinion that the pending time of the Constituent Assembly was not going exactly.
The text, which was adopted last night, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which attracted all attention, ultimately remains identical to that of the 1971 Constitution and states that "the principles of the Sharia are the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is an important requirement, had the hope to replace "the principles" with "the rules", which would have made it possible to apply more strictly.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is proof of their goodwill and respect for the other members of Egyptian society.
“Holyness” is backed by the liberals, who regard this as a propaganda attack.
Because they say that the constitution is Islamized over other articles.
In particular, they have in mind Article 220, which recognizes an advisory function of Al-Azhar University, in particular with regard to the verification of compliance with the laws of the Sharia.
According to Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, this is disturbing, as "the people who are called for an opinion have not been elected and do not have any democratic legitimacy.
Here you can see the first signs of theocracy.”
The fears of the liberals are also fueled by the fact that the next rector of this university should be far less moderate than the current.
“At the moment, there is no concrete religious commitment.
With this constitution we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not Ulema, but academics who have been trained in part in the French system,” says Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
He admits, however, "that there may be ambiguity with regard to Article 220, since the terms used are lent to the religious vocabulary.
One refers in particular to the "Fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence, noted. d.].
And in the future, the question could be raised as to how competent civil judges are to decide on this."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is strongly criticized for the broad powers it confers on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that these are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another point of dispute: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the desire of the military, the examination of the defence budget is not submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
Similarly, there will be no ban on civil proceedings in military courts, as the human rights associations have demanded.
The latter also share their concerns about the text which they consider to be a threat to freedom.
The fact of the blasphemie is being maintained, and insults are now banned, which could have serious consequences for the right to free speech, especially for the press.
In addition, an article no longer refers to the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In your opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
Proponents of the head of state will march on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists await sacred sites, the world’s navel and a sea of sunshine
The Promised Land combines the glory of biblical truths, modern comfort and untouched nature.
AIF gives you the five main reasons for visiting Israel.
Beyond the Sacred Places
Visit the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It means that all who bathe in this river receive God’s blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his miracles: the conversion of water into wine on a wedding feast, the walking on the water, the silence of the sea storm and the fishing.
This is where Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
Most of the shrines are located in Jerusalem.
Believers here follow the path of suffering or the path of Jesus Christ (Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The road begins at the Roman fortress Antonia, Pretorium where the court was, and leads through the streets of the Old Town to the Church of the Grave on Mount Golgotha, where the crucifixion, the anointing stone and the tomb of Jesus are located.
Here, in the Christian view, lies the navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of humanity.
The monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands at the place where, according to a Christian legend, the tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus grew.
Jerusalem is also the most holy place of the Jews - the plaintiff, the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
According to tradition, people of different faiths leave there tickets with wishes that will then be fulfilled.
Take a trip to the height
The ruins of the fortress of Massada form the remains of the secret hiding from enemies that Herod the Great had built for his family in 25 AD.
They are located on a rocky wall in the mountains at 450 meters above sea level.
Only mountaineers can reach the ruins on their own.
Everyone else brings an airstrip to this historic summit.
In the north of the country at 1600 to 2040 meters of altitude is the famous ski resort Hermon, where it attracts countless tourists during the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you can reach there by shuttle bus.
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 kilometers.
According to an old legend, supposedly pagan gods lived on the mountaintop.
Visiting Unique Museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
On a single trip, not all of them can be visited.
But at least the five most interesting of them should be allowed a visit.
Among them is once the Israel Museum not far from the Knesset (Parliament).
There are ancient Qumran manuscripts or scrolls from the Dead Sea found in rock caves in the Judean desert, as well as some 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
The collection of works by impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso will be exhibited there.
In Akko you can visit the museum in Bad Al Basha, which houses several rooms of old Turkish baths with sculptures of the visitors and bathers of the time.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum where you can admire the sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are no museum guides or souvenir shops.
Entrance is free and donations are generally refused.
The fifth museum, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most shocking chapters in history.
The most engaging department is the children’s memorial, built to commemorate the 1.5 million children destroyed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
At the entrance of the room, there is complete darkness.
The stars are shining.
And there are the names of the Jewish children and the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Do something for your health
The three main recreation areas of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of the three places there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceans.
Surprisingly, the Red Sea is also bathed in the winter months, as the water temperature does not fall below 21 <0xC2><0xB0>C and the air warms up to 23 <0xC2><0xB0>C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and is bathed all year round.
By the way, this unusual sea with a position of 417 meters below sea level is the deepest sea in the world.
Its turquoise water has a high salt content and thus even wears no swimmers easily on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments using salt water (natural salt sole) and healing mud, as well as for the treatment of skin inflammations, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and soothing tightened nerves.
Touching the Secrets of Old Age
These secrets hold the old town of Tel Aviv, the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city passed the famous sea route, connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to legends, Noah built his ark here, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with which he lived a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists like to stroll through the narrow streets named after star signs.
Fortuna is supposed to be the legend after all those who touch the walls in the street with their constellation.
In Jaffa you can meet newlywed couples from all over Israel and even other countries at photo dates.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can strip through the Roman theatre and conquer the fortress of the crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the most important city of Judea and the residence of Roman governors, including Pontius Pilate.
In the carefully restored theater these days, evening concerts and operas are performed.
Characteristics for tourists
If you are traveling to Israel, don’t worry about your poor English proficiency: Approximately 30% of Israelis speak Russian.
The money in the trip is preferred not in euros, but in dollars that can easily be converted into shekels (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekels).
In the city you usually get by bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a high-speed tram and in Haifa the only subway line in the country with six stations connecting the suburb to the upper city.
In fact, it is an underground cable car.
A ride within the city costs 6 shekels regardless of the means of transport, which is enough to include transfers for a ride of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated in Israel on Saturday.
From Friday night until sunset on Saturday, markets and shops are closed, and public transport rests.
And on Sunday morning, the week of work begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and restaurants, only kosher food is served, excluding pork, seafood, fish without shells and foods that contain both dairy and meat products.
Instead, you have the choice between different dishes with ham and beef, soups and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus paste, various sauces, fried beans and peanuts (falafel) as well as fruits and vegetables.
In the streets of Israeli cities, there are no stray dogs.
For this, there are many well-liked cats that sneak through the streets cozy and unhindered.
In the evening you can even see them sleeping on the rooftops of parking cars.
Cats like busy places and don’t say no to treats.
Depending on the brand, a rental car costs between <0x24>37 per day (Hyundai Getz) and <0x24>188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
The insurance costs an additional <0x24>15 per day.
And bike rental costs 15 shekels per day.
Tickets for museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
In figures
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most adventurers and recreation seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the United States and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists arrived in the Promised Land, corresponding to an increase of 51% compared to the 2010 comparison period, before the lifting of the visa requirement on February 9, 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" Leads to Moscow: Migrants Save Money for Language
While MPs and civil rights activists are discussing the benefits of the law on binding language tests for migrants, criminals are already dealing with fake certificates
Every year, 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money for the maintenance of the families that remain at home.
On 1 December, a law entered into force, according to which every working migrants must pass a test that certifies the knowledge of the Russian language.
Until now, this scheme applies only to migrants who wish to work in the services sector, in the municipal housing sector and in retail.
However, the tests are expected to be mandatory over time for all guest workers, according to the Federal Migration Authority.
It is necessary to pass not only language tests, but also tests into the history of Russia and the basics of the legislation.
Language skills must be demonstrated both for obtaining and renewing the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
Also exempted from this law are persons who received their training certificates and diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Sense, Problematics and Protection of Rights
The entirety of the exams will be under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute for the Russian Language, the Russian University of International Friendship, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants can pass the tests in all cities; already more than 160 corresponding centers have been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the tests was supported by members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
Citizens’ rights, on the other hand, asked the press several times before the law came into force: What does the whole mean?
What changes does the regulation bring to show language skills, both for the Russians and for the guest workers?
First and foremost, opposition to the Migration Authority’s spokespersons, it is about reducing the number of forced workers.
"Many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers," said Viktor Sebelew, head of the Federal Immigration Authority in Tajikistan.
However, your rights must be protected before your departure.
Only an organized recruitment will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Migrants without a job, education, language skills and medical examination face problems.
Sebelew is convinced that a future migrant without language skills will necessarily meet people with bad intentions who will put him under the pretext of help in a dark, narrow barrel, where he will endure with dozens of his likes for months without food and documents and 12 to 14 hours a day.
There are many complaints from our migrants.
“In your home country, the One will promise you, and upon arrival you will be cheated, their passports will be taken away, and you will not receive the promised salary,” said Tolib Schwarzipow, head of the Tajik Emigration Agency’s Chief Labor Migration Office.
Don't shampoo, boss!
Yet many citizens of the Central Asian republics, who want to make their money in Russia, admit that they are not only unable to speak the language of the target country, but can hardly express themselves in writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault as the evil: only a few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford only reasonable basic education.
For there is not even money in their families to feed the children, except to buy them decent clothes, shoes, and school supplies.
As a teenager, these children immediately took the first opportunity to make money.
"It's difficult without language skills," they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Citizens’ rights underline the following important aspect of the law.
Only migrants with legal status are required to pass the test.
If you do not have this status, there is no examination and therefore no official work.
In the meantime, most of the guest workers remain illegal in Russia.
"Welcome" or "Access Banned for Unauthorized"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic barriers and, of course, linguistic difficulties.
In addition, the legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
You can make a fake registration quickly and only for a thousand and a half.
The employees of the Russian police know that our documents are largely fake and we are not registered, and then there are cases of blackmail.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," Tadschik Umed Huschkadamow told reporters.
"Don't worry about the cost of fake papers"
Already on the day the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of migrants could be fake.
Some fake certificates certifying the completion of the language test have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Authority.
The counterfeit papers were printed with an ordinary color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not receive these for nothing: every migrant who hoped to be able to save the tests paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
That’s more than twice the cost of the official test: it costs migrant workers three thousand rubles.
The fact that the most important immediate task is to protect the system from corruption so that the certificates cannot be bought easily is agreed by both officials and civil rights holders.
For the time being, the authorities can only promise guest workers who fall through the test for the first time that they will get time for a basic language course.
In addition, newcomers without language skills are offered jobs in areas where no active understanding with people is necessary.
Ministry of the Interior ignores illegal arms market
The proportion of legal weapons in crimes is very low
The Russian Interior Ministry plans to tighten the arms law for private gun owners.
The authorities react to the recent events: injuries in shootings at weddings and seven deaths in the amok of Moscow lawyer Dmitri Winogradov.
The police want to ban the use of non-lethal weapons in public and to raise the age for possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal was supported by the chairman of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Jarowaja, and promised that the amendments to the Arms Act will be submitted to the Duma shortly.
Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the Russian authorities want to combat the problems by "attracting the screws".
An open letter was published on the Internet, the author of which - representatives of various arms associations - called on the authorities to refrain from "sensual aggravations".
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very low, the criminal justice, Wasili Lesnikov, told the Russian BBC service.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes were committed using registered weapons over a period of six months in 2012, while a total of 1,168 thousand crimes were registered for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a tightening of the law for private gun criminals will not prevent them from operating on the black market.
Currently, according to the authors, you can find every possible weapon in Moscow for little money.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior stresses that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from the factories to the officers
Weapons can reach the black market through several channels.
There are five such main channels, says former colonel Viktor Baranez, who has worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of a website that accepts gun orders
The first channel is the army or military, i.e. weapons stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
“The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves,” Baranez said.
On the second channel, illegal weapons are being stolen from criminals.
Baranez explains that this includes weapons that have been stolen from both the police’s arms chambers and directly from staff of the prosecution authorities.
Other illegally sold weapons come from military arms warehouses.
In many military camps, there were frequent explosions.
"There is evidence that in some cases it was a firefighting foundation to conceal the absence of weapons," the former military official said.
According to Baranez, gun manufacturers also contribute to the black market.
“Today, there are countless private arms factories that cannot withstand international competition, and therefore are plundering the weapons at hand in the black market, for example in Moscow,” the expert reports.
Another channel of the black market is smuggling.
Especially many guns and guns come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
“There is a private, sometimes handcrafted production, as well as a mafia that organizes the smuggling,” the former military official explains.
Where did the guns come from?
Experts calculated how much of each of the five channels has approximately in the supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
In 2011, a report was prepared by the Center for Problem Analysis and Government Administration.
The experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Service for State Statistics, Criminological Literature and publicly available data on Weapons portals.
The vast majority of the illegal weapons, according to the investigators, come from the army and the law enforcement authorities.
Half of all weapons on the black market are caused by “the guilt of those responsible for dealing with weapons in their work,” the report said.
According to the researchers, 17% of weapons come from conflict areas, 14% come from thefts in arms production, and 5% come from illegal excavations.
A sales adviser at a gun store, which does not want to be named, ensures that weapons found in illegal excavations are no longer bought because they are outdated.
According to him, it is more common for merchants to get the grocery in a warehouse.
A gun, such as a TT-type gun, is purchased via a gun.
The weapon is displayed and passed through the fence.
“The dealer brings the gun into the city and sells it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines,” he says.
“The police, of course, know about everything and, therefore, if they cannot comply with the crime detection plan, periodic check-ups are made by dealers offering illegal weapons,” the sales advisor adds.
"Who in the luxury store"
Buyers and sellers find the most familiar to each other.
I had looked at websites and blogs when someone noticed me and suggested coming to the station "Begowaja" where someone would wait for me, who would take me to a certain place where we could then negotiate the price.
I only got the price for the gun there.
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"To get a gun, I need a friend who has contacts," says the sales advisor. "I have such a friend, but I don't trust him."
There are traders in the markets, but there you have to go and meet with a code like "by Ivan Ivanovich, who makes it clear that the daughter has lost a tooth".
I'm even getting a few hit rings right now about a friend I trust.
He also gives me the drum rings just because he knows I don't bite him.
Newbies are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military member Viktor Baranez tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he wrote an article on the subject.
According to him, the schemes have not changed.
He received a photo album depicting "everything possible".
“I felt like I was in a luxury store,” recalls the military man.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the bag, but can try everything.
As a potential customer, I not only buy, but drive with the seller into the forest, and there we set up a target disk.
“Then I can shoot there, and if I’m convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we’ll negotiate with each other,” the expert describes the move.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results for websites and groups in "Vkontakte" where weapons are offered "for different purposes".
No papers are required, and there are no personal meetings.
“You only need the appropriate amount of money,” says the ad on the “Buy Fighter Guns or Guns” website.
There, users place their orders and make requests.
Is it also sold to minors?
"Of course without license", user asks "Iwan" (literal quote).
"Buy a TT. Moscow", is the laconic request of "Fedorenkov".
Recently, the Federal Security Service has opened countless seeming websites, and buyers who want to buy weapons go up to the service.
People come like hungry fish when feeding and then land in Siberia and let coal sparkle
Military commentator and former military rank member Viktor Baranez
I have heard from the following scheme: The website is normally registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
Responsible persons accept orders.
The buyer transfers the money through a bank ATM.
"In response, he receives a photo and a description of the hidden weapon," Dmitry Kislow, a spokesman for the non-profit organization Pravo na oryzhie, said.
Viktor Baranez stresses that in the end, you can also go out empty and come behind bars when you place a request on a website.
Recently, the Federal Security Service has opened countless seeming websites, and buyers who want to buy weapons go up to the service.
“People come like hungry fish when feeding and then land in the Siberian labor camp and are allowed to spark coal,” he says.
A Macarow for <0x24>100
When buying illegal firearms, experts say prices range from <0x24>100 to <0x24>900.
According to Dmitrij Kislow of the organization "Pravo na oryzhie" you can buy a gun of the type Makarow for <0x24>100 to <0x24>300.
You have to wait up to a month and a half.
The weapon is spent in military arms warehouses by mid-range supervisors.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, the number of crimes with illegal weapons in all of Russia decreased by 7% from January to October 2011 to 22.9 thousand, while the number of discovered cases of theft and blackmail related to weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices fell by 7%.
U.S. fast food and supermarket workers on strike
One in four U.S. youths are sitting behind McDonald’s’s cash register.
In recent days there have been massive protests across the U.S. against low wages in Walmart stores and restaurants popular fast food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can yet predict whether the protests will continue to swell or whether they will be airing again soon.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-wing non-profit organizations.
In addition to raising the modest wages of simple Walmart and fast food workers, the organizers of the protests pursue the goal of establishing trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy is barely syndicated.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, where sales took place in the United States, attracting millions of customers, sometimes leading to hand mass.
On that day, some Walmart employees, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, laid down their work and worked together with trade unions and left-wing activists branches of the chain whose target group are low- and middle-income people.
Walmart sells all products, from diapers to hunting guns and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The goods in Walmart branches are on average between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That’s why many of the low-paid Walmart employees only buy in their own workplace.
The prices and product range made Walmart one of the largest companies in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can often only sell the goods so cheaply because employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complain about severe working conditions, such as missing forklifts or hand scanners.
Participants in the Black Friday protests demanded wage increases and expressed their anger that the contribution to operating health insurance had increased from <0x24>30 to <0x24>100 a month.
A typical Walmart employee who earns <0x24>9.5 an hour could not afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from the University of California in Berkeley prove that if the company raises the average salary to <0x24>12 an hour, it would cost Walmart <0x24>3.2 billion.
That’s about 1.1% more than they donate now for wages.
If Walmart turned the wage increases completely on customers, each purchase would cost them only 46 cents more in the future.
For them, this would be a <0x24>12.39 per year compared to today.
Proponents of Walmart said they were satisfied that there were protests in only nine states, which did not cause any losses to the company.
Black Friday lasted in its store from 8:00 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the next day, and during this period Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, the Walmart cash registers carried out nearly 100 million transactions on "Black Friday".
The company’s spokesman, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the left-wing Huffington Post website that in total, “less than five” Walmart employees were shutting down the work and the protest was just “another PR trick” of the union that organized the protests.
"Free cash!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their target was not Walmart affiliates (which are not desired in this advanced city and therefore so far inexistent), but McDonald's and other inexpensive restaurants.
McDonald's says the company sells billions of portions, and yet you're not being given sick days, and you're not being paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Council member
Currently, the minimum wage according to federal and New York law is <0x24>7.25 per hour.
In fast-food restaurants, the minimum wage is gradually raised, but not too high, and on average, their simple staff in New York gets <0x24>8.90 an hour.
No one deserves less in this expensive city.
How it is possible to get out in New York with so little money is incomprehensible to me.
There was once a time when almost a quarter of all American teenagers were behind the desk after school at McDonald’s, but the teenagers were still living with their parents.
No one saw the main source of income or plan to stay there longer.
Now, in interviews with McDonald’s employees, I constantly meet people who complain that they have to get out with this salary and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the Wall Street Journal forum, whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
Participants of the protests, which began on Thursday at 6.30 a.m. in front of McDonald’s on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and chefs of fast-food restaurants receive a minimum wage of <0x24>15 an hour, which is more than a doubling of the average salary per hour.
They continued to demand the formation of trade unions in the fast-food industry.
U.S. law prohibits corporate governance from engaging in this goal and dismissing or dismissing union members.
On the other hand, business management does not make it easy for them.
However, the establishment of trade unions in the fast-food industry is also difficult for objective reasons.
The main reason is the high staff fluctuation.
Unsatisfied
There were loud protests on that day before many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan.
The climax of the protests was a meeting at noon ahead of McDonald's at Times Square, where some local Democrats spoke, including city councilman Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald's says it's not selling billions of servings, and yet you're not going to get paid for work, you're not going to get sick days."
The protesters were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example Mayor Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should jointly support the fast-food staff so that they can get a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!"
According to the New York Times, this was the largest action of its kind in the history of the U.S. fast food industry.
However, only a few hundred people on the spot, not all of whom are employed in the fast food industry, were employed by tens of thousands in New York.
It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilize the whole masses.
"The brain can only be moderately overlooked so far"
The theme of augmented reality, popular with modern technology fans, has been generally perceived by the lens of a special glasses lately.
Google first presented a working model at its annual conference in the summer, then in November it was announced that Microsoft had also applied for a corresponding patent.
However, in a conversation with the head of the Group for Interactive 3D Technologies at Microsoft Laboratory in Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, it becomes clear that the glasses were only a transit station for the company’s scientists.
It excites the ability to manipulate virtual objects in the air with bare hands and create virtual open spaces.
- Please describe briefly what research your group is doing.
- We deal with the interaction of man and machine, but we want to expand the limits of this interaction.
So far, humanity has remained largely stuck in the phase where pixels are worked on flat screens, which are sometimes also touched.
However, we want to anticipate 5-10 years and predict the radical changes in this interaction.
For example, Xbox consoles and Kinect sensors are a progression, and today Xbox is no longer sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in motion control.
- What's waiting for us in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, a lot still plays on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the output has not yet been decisive.
We try to change that, working on real three-dimensional representation systems based on different technologies, including projections.
We have to let the computer world go into our physical world and make it more feasible.
For this, however, it is necessary that not only the user, but also his environment is recognized.
Then we could complement the real world much easier with virtual objects.
And first of all, we should get rid of these shy virtual reality helms!
- What do you think about voice control?
She's popular, but isn't she overrated?
- It is certainly not the all-purpose solution, as it raises questions about privacy, because you do not always want to inform everyone about his actions and intentions.
Actually, every kind of interaction with computers is good, but each in its specific niche.
For example, in the area of controlling objects in public places, we worked on a project where we experimented with short and short rather than unloading gestures.
The gestures were not recorded by the object camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but could theoretically be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But overall, the future belongs to mixed control types, such as gesture and language.
- What's that?
- Would you ask me, for example, to supply you with this spruce can?
They say it and mean it at the same time.
- Normally I just say it.
- Oh, that would be very hard to recognize.
- Does that mean you want the user to adapt to what a machine can afford at any given time and what not?
- Not necessarily, but it's about a mutual approach.
I think that in the future we will need to work primarily on the development of new sensor types that allow us to capture reactions from people more closely.
These can be laser sensors, for example, because they provide a good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- What demands do you place on modern cameras based on your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors?
Is it lack of resolution, depth or something else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and depth.
In this way, all current technologies are not good enough for us, as the developers of the algorithms have more work to do.
It must be taken into account not only the resolution along the X and Y, but also along the Z axis.
The speed and number of images per second are also important.
Man’s movements are extremely dynamic and frankly, the current 30 fps are too small, especially for gestures.
In our Redmond laboratory, Stephen Betishes developed a touch sensor with a adjustable processing delay of between 1 and 100 milliseconds, with today’s commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction of man and machine.
For my work, I needed exactly such a device, only without touch control and with more images per second.
Shouldn't the number of cameras be increased?
- Kinect currently works with three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second is a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the object depth.
More cameras might solve the problem.
Or aggravate the problem as more calculations would be needed.
It would be nice to have a flexible Kinect-like system where we could play with different camera inclinations to see how this helps us in the three-dimensional detection of a position.
“If I remember correctly, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Don’t you think that in terms of the application of augmented reality technology in everyday life, glasses have the best outlook?
- Of course, it is not pleasant to keep a smartphone in your hands on the go, but I think the best option would be a "changing" augmented reality where we could switch from glasses to smartphone via a cloud,
The glasses are a personal gadget and therein lies their strength (privates can only see you), but also their weakness, because augmented reality through glasses prevents you from working together with others on virtual objects.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is accessible not only to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to normal mortals.
There is a problem that critics of this idea often point to: There is no sensitive reaction!
My hands feel nothing at all!
What answers does your group want to give to this objection?
In my lectures, I often talk about the fact that augmented reality represents the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could quite be the integration of tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as a somewhat unusual projection substrate.
She's taking great pressure!
But there are also technologies that are actually aimed at giving the "images in the air" some hand-hold, for example, the interference of some targeted ultrasound rays at a certain point where the finger is located generates a feeling that is currently as weak as breathing over the hands.
There are also bands for the wrist that affect the nerve endings in the fingers, also this is a potential direction.
- Have you tried to overlook the brain?
It makes you think that it feels what it should feel when it sees something right now?
- That's a good idea, so we haven't tried it yet.
Here lies another task with which we will have to fight for a long time, namely to make a person who is physically in a closed space, to believe that he is instead in an open, virtually infinite space; here we work on concepts with platforms, as well as large bands (others in Finess).
So far, the brain can only be moderately overlooked, and we still have many busy years ahead of us.
This is exactly what makes work in the field of virtual reality so appealing for a researcher: We are only at the beginning on many topics.
Personal taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburger Avantgarde", which is dedicated to urban residents who form the avant-garde of art and culture.
Already high-ranking representatives of the St. Petersburg art scene, whose successes go beyond the city’s borders and often find recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia, landed on the list.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, the red-dressed bear, which you will find at the Russian Museum, at the summer garden, at scenery meetings or at vernissages.
Wherever the pictures of Kirill Miller are displayed, they attract large crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical St. Petersburg socio-philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a prominent figure in the St. Petersburg avant-garde in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
He is also a man of the city and by his presence on the street enchants his fellow citizens with a smile in their faces and ensures good mood with them.
Recently, he caught a spinning horn and became a St. Petersburg spinning horn player, as he finally felt ready for this difficult role in terms of his artist life, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not, for example, in yellow or turquoise in the city?
I chose the color Red as a fashion designer, which is different from the optics and the image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artists, image consultants and society.
In society, anything that differs slightly from the gray norm produces aggression and bad behavior.
But I want to talk to people through my provocations.
Each of my past provocations was an invitation to a conversation.
When did you know you had to be a painter?
- At an exhibition in the Cultural Palace Newskij, where my works were exhibited.
I understand that I have to go this way.
Then the time of the old free but not officially recognized painters at the time came to an end, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I made friends with the painters of the new generation, i.e. with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; from this came "Pushkinskaya 10", and then it was only once finished.
It attracts me to theater, to fashion, to music, actually to everything except literature.
It was important for me to be at the center of the St. Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists should be gathered.
In 1995 I occupied a room in Pushkinskaya 10, and there was a musical-art club for the Bohemia until the renovation work.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazz, and I also remember how cord came there with his project "Ucho Van Goga".
Schnur and his friends sang simple songs to play back, wore tight jerseys and included today's fashionable composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group began to play live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it began his great career, but he learned the basics from us.
Also the gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" have their origins in the art clinic.
That was where our staff and family guests went.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture still meant something.
In 2000, there was a press survey, which included the award “Personals of Our City”.
I won in the category "Artists of the Year", and thus I was at the peak.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty, and culture of the last century.
In today’s time it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: one can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your works have an unmistakable style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and clearly express the actuality and sharpness of the thoughts.
I will have an exhibition entitled "The Russian Museum as Clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and prepares to be like that.
In a clown, it wipes out everything and loses its tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
For example, let’s save the world by prescribing that everyone has to completely dress up.
Now everyone is paying attention to the clothes and orienting themselves on the outside and not on the inside of the person.
But perhaps one should not give a man his hand, but should spit in his face.
The deception disappears by disguising.
Recently, we saw you in the role of the city's turn-around player, and a cultural city should have such a hero.
Who, if not me?
Can commercial art be beautiful as well?
- Today, commercial art must be cautious, considerate and tactful.
We see the collapse of cultures.
In the past, people formed large groups: the Bohemians loved one and the simple people loved the other.
Now there are micro-communities, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a <0x24>100 note that everyone likes.
Now you have to think about who you'll like.
Now every cult star has about 100 followers.
- Stas Mikhailov's performances include several thousand!
- Abandoned women come to him, where the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons, 300 people come and not 10 thousand, as a result, there is less management, money, and everything goes down.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to cheat on them and not to destroy what has been achieved.
In my youth, I painted such paintings that were hanged by a collector even in a series of works by Falk and Larionow.
I started with pictures that usually come only at the end of my career.
There are often misunderstandings these days.
It means: intellectual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture at all, that’s something completely different.
I am a person of past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to paint.
This is the culture that I support.
- Kirill, what's missing in Petersburg?
- Good culture expert.
They say, “servants of culture.”
But not all of them can deal with culture.
For the real Tsars it was different, for the Tsars might not understand much of culture, but they understood that proper experts are necessary.
There are currently good advisors in Moscow.
In St. Petersburg, we have some that might be experts, but they are blocked by the way, as it requires high-ranking experts to evaluate the first ones correctly and free them the way.
Now it only counts for its own taste.
The same applies to Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and therefore some painters have to look for other museums.
- What's St. Petersburg for you?
- Petersburg is not the cultural capital; in Moscow there is much more culture and a corresponding nourishment ground.
Art can only grow hard on our stones.
We need a cultural nourishment, because, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that’s not right.
In Europe, there are many curious people who visit exhibitions or concerts.
With us, that is much less.
Art must be modern again, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is funded by grants from the city of St. Petersburg
Born in space
Earth in danger.
Warm-up or collision with asteroid killer.
Caravans of spaceships with terrestrial inhabitants on board are on the lookout for a replacement planet.
In order to save humanity, the important question is how can we continue to grow in gravity or on the substitute planet?
I don’t think there are many choices.
In fact, there are only two real planets that we could at least hypothetically inhabit.
"In general, Mars and Venus," says scientist at the Astronomical Sternberg Institute Wladimir Surdin.
However, while conditions on Mars are relatively life-friendly, a temperature of 500 degrees prevails on the surface of Venus.
Life would only be possible at a high altitude or in the orbit of Venus, i.e. in all.
The question of reproduction in the universe was first dealt with by the researchers in terms of the flora.
Already half a century ago, experiments with plants were conducted.
The fourth generation of herbs grown in orbit did not differ in the least from the earthly species.
It followed the breeding of insects, more precisely small fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, watchmen were sent to space to explore how gravity affects the development of embryos.
It develops a very normal chick.
But then the problem begins.
“The problem is that the chick has to find a stop; it has to be able to stand on its legs and start to move,” explains Vladimir Sychev, the head of the Institute for Medical-Biological Problems.
Without a solid base, the chicks ran wild.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborns were completely suppressed.
The chicks did not respond to light and noise.
Four days later, they simply died.
“Twice we let chicks slip and put the whole thing in because it’s simply impossible to work with them there,” said Vladimir Sychev, adding that the experiment with the chicks in space failed.
The last cage of animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, only same-sex species will be found on the biosatellite "Bion".
There was an experiment with rats that were already fertilized and sent into space.
In principle, nothing special has been observed.
"That was just with the biosatellites, but again it was just a single experiment, and the research needs to continue," notes Vladimir Sychev.
After the landing, the space rats grew.
The problem of reproduction directly in space has so far not been solved.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are ripped out of their natural habitat simply cannot follow their reproductive drive.
Unlike animals, humans could do so in principle.
Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
Such experiments are not carried out on ethical grounds.
Women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was with Tereshkova.
The most valuable thing that humanity possesses is the female organism.
Our mother flew away from it, and no one on Earth could have answered the following question: Does it transcend space flight?
Will she be able to bring a child to the world after this flight?
"Finally, no one answered this question," says the space veteran Watchman.
In June 1964, just a year after her space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The child's father, Andriyan Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in the universe, Svetlana Sawizkaja, who was twice in orbit and even worked outside the spacecraft, gave birth to a son.
Still, there is a risk.
We have very few cosmonauts who have gone well after long flights and have healthy offspring.
“The more dangerous it is even when flying into orbit,” concludes cosmonaut Waleri Poljakov, a hero of the Soviet Union and a hero of the Russian Federation.
Yet humanity must look for new pathways in biotechnology, radiation protection, and the production of artificial gravity.
The hydrolaboratory at the Cosmonauts Preparation Center is a mandatory station during flight preparation.
Here in a floating state, the cosmonauts gain routine for working in open space.
The water is the weightlessness.
Even if adults feel water as comfortable, it is a foreign environment; but infants feel water as a natural element.
It is as if the little Ichtyanders were giving evidence that life on land originated in the ocean.
There is a correlation between the fact that a child is about 9 months in the womb of the mother in fruit water, and the fact that it can then more easily get used to water.
In principle, this is logical, since from birth to the first swim it takes just 2 weeks.
“It’s too little time to forget something,” says baby swimming teacher Marina Aksenowa.
So, while for a newborn child, gravity is a much more natural condition, the woman does not come out without severity.
In the state of severity, the abdominal and pelvic muscles develop rapidly and thus decrease the ability to push the child out.
Well, let's deal with this through birth-inducing aids.
For example, the birth could also take place in a special chamber to push the child out.
"But then what happens?" is the not insignificant question of Waleri Polyakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the formation of the earth, the organism cannot form the skeleton and the muscles.
A newborn child cannot be put into a load suit in orbit like an adult for training.
He will simply miss what is of elementary importance to his life.
“This experiment, which we do together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead us to bring to the world a disabled, a completely inappropriate person,” says Igor Pestow, head of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute for Medical and Biological Problems RAN.
So far, the birth of children in space is a mere theory.
At some point, however, it will become a reality when the Earth’s inhabitants in their spaceships break up into a distant planet that will be home to their all-born descendants.
NK<0xC3><0x9A> Chief: Control of the Black System Fails by Guilt of Politics
In the context of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good control bodies and adequate laws, but falls within their application.
In the interview for Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz, this is said by the Vice-President of the Supreme Control Board (NK<0xC3><0x9A>), Miloslav Kala.
"A law is never perfect, but it needs to be applied correctly - and I don't think that's the case with us," Kala commented on the current situation.
A similar result appears to be a joint inspection by Czech and German auditors.
As a negative example, he leads the appointment of Prime Minister Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as to the so-called "black system".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not harass entrepreneurs with controls - so is the system now banned or allowed?
“A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then it cannot simply come to the chairman of the government, and the control panel, whose duty is once again to control compliance with the law, hinders its activity,” Kala notes.
At the meeting of the Control Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint Czech-German project in which the laws of the two countries relating to public procurement were compared.
What was that specifically about?
This is a parallel test, which we started about two years ago.
Simply put, it is the European legislature that determines how public procurement is handled, which is based on the national legislation and, finally, on the actual practical application.
We have compared all this with each other, and although the examination has not yet been completed, we have been able to find extremely interesting differences. Generally speaking, the laws are perhaps even a little "stricter and perfecter" with us, but the actual application is better in Germany in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to establish new and more precise rules over and over and over again, and it is also necessary to deal with the actual application of the law.
How can the project help you? What is the result of this project for you?
It is precisely this kind of joint control that could help us to stop constantly striving to improve laws and reduce and align thresholds if this does not seem to have a particularly positive effect.
Economicality means acquiring a thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and excluding unlawful enrichment or even criminal acts.
But the reduction of thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we will achieve this goal as well.
Perhaps it is even so that we charge the system in this way only with excessive "paper cram," and those looking for gaps in the system will have much easier to exploit the system than if the thresholds remained higher.
They talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech Competition Act.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority here as our NK<0xC3><0x9A>, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German counterpart to the NK<0xC3><0x9C> of the Federal Court of Auditors, which is similar to that of us and also has a college, which is formed only slightly differently, but in principle both authorities work similarly.
The competences are also comparable to some extent, but Germany is a federal state, i.e. that there are also these courts in the individual states - in which the German system differs from ours.
The BRH can only control federal funds, which corresponds to our state funds.
Public funds managed by the districts and municipalities are subject there to the control of the county courts.
When it comes to German legislation, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare this without concrete information, however, in some respects Germany is often referred to as a model, but it is certainly not possible to say that Germany is better at all.
Is it because the testers are better there?
It certainly doesn’t, but as I said, I don’t like such comparisons.
It should also be noted that those countries that are a model for us are also facing problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn’t have anything to do with cooperation with our authorities, would they?
As far as the Czech legislation is concerned, what was the significance of the renewal of the award law for your authority, do you already feel any impact?
Given that this novel is only in effect for a short period of time, it has not yet worked on our exams.
Since our checks are carried out subsequently, there is a certain delay to be expected here.
We have so far felt the effects in the preparatory phase of future controls - so we have introduced the new control tool "Recognition of risks of non-economics" and with this almost 14,000 public contracts have been tested and analyzed - the changes will have an effect here, of course.
Do you see the adoption of this law more positive, or is the system being burdened with further bureaucracy?
I think that this law is definitely a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption will be confirmed.
However, the problem may be that the rules will become "stricter" and can no longer be adhered to.
Already under the previous rules, the persons subject to examination with respect to the carrier (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) are accountable for the fact that any non-compliance with the award law is a violation of the budgetary discipline.
But does it make sense to make the law even stricter?
I don't think that way.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system, and not punish those who have committed a form error that does not affect the actual decision-making.
Such a system only puts the bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where's the way out here?
First, let’s say which path is not targeted.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not involve entrepreneurs in controlling the so-called "black system" - what exactly does that mean?
Is the black system now banned or allowed?
A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then it cannot simply come to the chairman of the government, and the control branch, whose duty is once again to control compliance with the law, can hinder its activity.
He can say, "We change the law and allow the thing," but he cannot say that we do as if there were nothing.
The award law contains relatively strict rules on the formal execution of certain procedures - and this is also true for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the bidder is excluded with the best offer only due to form errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and that is what we lack in my opinion.
On the streets there are isolated glaciers, but they are mostly dry.
On the roads of the Czech Republic, snow and ice are partly found.
Mostly, however, the roads are well-travelled, but at times increased caution is offered.
Karlsbad
In the district of Karlsbad, the roads were well-travelled this morning, insulated snow and ice glaciers.
The temperatures drop to -5 to -10 <0xC2><0xB0>C, during the day it should be slightly warmer.
It is no longer snowing in the region, and only a thin snow cover remains in the lower altitudes.
On the slopes of the Erzgebirge, however, there is about 30 cm of snow.
According to the district street guard, there was limited view due to mists.
The R6 highway and the first class roads in the region are currently unrestricted.
However, attention is paid, for example, to bridges on which the roads are sometimes required and smooth.
All traffic routes of the second and third class roads, including mountain roads, are also accessible.
On these roads, however, there are partially required or exited snow remains.
In particular in the higher layers, therefore, increased attention is given.
Districts of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some roads in East Bohemia, there is a risk of glaciation, in higher positions and in the mountains, there is sometimes still an extinct snow layer on the roads, the road and highway directions informs on their websites.
The road fairs warn drivers of glaciation, which can occur especially in higher positions in the Pardubice district.
Ice glaciers can be found in the districts of Lan<0xC5><0xA1>kroun, <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Orlicí, Poli<0xC4><0x8D>ka, Svitavy and Vysoké M<0xC3><0xBD>to, in particular on second and third class roads.
The roads I/43 and I/34 at Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow is especially found on the roads in the Giant Mountains and in the Orlic<0xC3><0xBD> Mountains.
An excavated snow layer is located in altitudes on the roads of the Rychnov nad Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>nou and Trutnov districts.
In East Bohemia it will be mostly sunny or hot today, and it will be mostly rainy.
The temperatures range between -3 and <0x2B>1 <0xC2><0xB0>C, there is a weak wind blowing.
Pilsen District
The roads in the district of Pilsen are easily accessible today, but there is increased attention on the ground and the road is adapted to the weather.
This is frozen in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below the freezing point.
Since it has snowed in the past and the temperatures subsequently drop, it can become ice-slide on the streets.
There is also fog on site, but the view will improve over the course of the day.
This information comes from the district street masterpieces.
The motorway D5 is practically unrestricted, but increased attention is recommended by the road masters between the 80th and the 131st kilometer.
The first class highways are mostly dry, but frozen.
However, in the south of the circles of Mushrooms and Tachov there can be ice glaciers.
The second and third class roads are wet, and therefore the reference to possible required sections applies here as well.
Drivers should be particularly cautious on the less frequented roads in the Bohemian forest area.
Olomouc District
Today, drivers who are heading towards the elevations in the Olomouc district have to rely on snow mattresses.
After the use of scaffolding vehicles, snow mats remain on the pass <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské sedlo as well as on the road towards Videlsk<0xC3><0xBD> k<0xC5><0x99>í<0xC5><0xBE>.
In the district of <0xC5><0xA0>umperk, the street masters were forced to snow at night, according to the road administration, about 3 cm of snow fell.
In the rest of the district, the highways are usually unrestricted.
"In the district of <0xC5><0xA0>umperk, snow remains at the highest altitudes.
On the <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské sedlo pass, the drivers have to count on snow mats towards Jeseník," an employee of the road administration <0xC5><0xA0>umperk told <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
Her colleagues in the district of Jeseník also had to go out at night, according to her, the roads to the altitudes after chemical treatment are free and wet.
In the district of Olomouc, the roads are unrestricted, but in the district of <0xC5><0xA0>ternberk, drivers must be careful in forest areas, as the roads are still wet.
<0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem, Liberec District
In North Bohemia, the street masterpieces report several poorly transported road sections equally.
In addition to several places with snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice in the district of <0xC3><0x9A>stí n.K. is blocked, according to the traffic police.
The temperatures also remain below zero, so that snow and ice remain on the roads. From the depths, especially southeast of the Bohemian Middle Mountains, no problems have been reported, and the roads are usually dry there.
No traffic disturbances have been reported so far.
Ice glaciers are reported in particular from the district of <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>tí.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions for this at night - rain during the day and melting snow, at night cloudless skies and frosts.
The main routes and the road I/13 on the border between the districts of <0xC3><0x9A>stí n.L. and Liberec are notified of poor traffic conditions.
The blockade of the road between Telnice and Knínice was necessary due to branches that were pushed from the snow load to the tramway.
<0xC5><0xA0>imon Ornest: At our concerts we want to gather positive energy
What do you think about the end of the world in less than a month?
This is one of those disaster reports that we humans are so fond of jumping on.
With our band The Tap Tap, we’re rather funny about it, saying that we’re the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to stop or prevent the end of the world.
In December, you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the collapse of the world.
Can you introduce the project to our readers?
This is a nationwide charity event that we have been planning for two years.
To do this, we want to use the marketing potential of the Maya calendar, whose end is forecast for December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
The day before, i.e. on 20 December, three concerts will be held simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava from 21:00.
The end of the concerts is expected to be around the time when the Maya calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is 12 hours ahead of us.
Where does this idea come from?
Originally probably from me, then we designed the idea together with our graphic designer Honza Augusta.
Not only do we want to accumulate enough positive energy to prevent the collapse of the world, but we also want to think together with the public about the state in which we once surrender this world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, t-shirts, bags and keychains against the end of the world, with which the purchase of them can also support us through www.e-tap.cz.
The band The Tap Tap, along with other performers, has also recorded the so-called anthem against the end of the world under the title "World Falling Out".
Even today, the anthem is very popular on YouTube. Will it also be featured at the Benefiz concert?
Of course, and in the end, provided that everything is working and that the end of the world does not take place...
The hymn will be sung by all performers at all three concerts at the same time.
In addition, the hymns will be broadcast live together in a live broadcast from Czech television.
The lyrics of the hymn are from Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X sings with...
How did you get to cooperate with the two?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is related to the realization of many charity events and concerts...
We strive to involve these people intensively in our projects.
It has been shown that most people are interested in working with us, and have fun with it.
For what purpose does the revenue of the concerts benefit against the end of the world?
For the establishment of the barrier-free educational center Studeo, where we have been working with the association Tap at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute for six years.
The students of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute are regularly attended by lecturers who help them in different leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the resources to visit the lecturers, we want to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, a separate building will be created, into which we will then enter with this project.
At each concert there are several groups and interpreters.
What criteria have you selected for this?
We wanted to put together a program that addresses all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, there are Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Such<0xC3><0xBD>.
You can find out everything else on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "big events" planned for the future?
In May we will perform at Prague Spring for the first time, and also for this concert we will prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to perform in the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are already in the United States - would like to combine this with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not exactly small, so far you have already appeared in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these journeys logistically and organisationally?
It’s not as bad as it seems at first glance.
Five of our members are wheelchair drivers, i.e. the wheelchairs must be transported in the luggage compartment. Besides, of course, we need to drag many instrument suitcases and other luggage...
Nonetheless, it has always worked without problems so far, <0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways were always very well prepared for us that I have sometimes wondered myself already.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your trips abroad, you will have a comparison of what it looks like in the individual countries with accessibility, how to deal with people with disabilities there, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than with us, we witnessed in Russia that in the East everything is still in its beginnings.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is absolutely not handicapped, and it is still unusual to travel in a wheelchair alone in the city centre.
It is not even natural there that a wheelchair driver is presented, for example, in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are also associations that try to point out the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what respect do we have to retreat towards the developed countries?
There are many other things that we hang on to...
However, it should be noted that an improvement in the situation also always depends on the efforts of the parties concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with severe disabilities to move independently in public spaces, go to the museum, use toilets, etc.
However, it is not very common for a larger group of people with disabilities to actively participate in social events there, we are a little ahead of the band The Tap Tap West!
Respect in the public and accessibility is one thing, but only when important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come from our ranks will things really start to change.
So far, these are only individual cases of particularly willful personalities.
The Tap Tap is very popular at the moment, but if we go back a few years, what motivated you to start a band in 1998?
At that time, I started as a caregiver at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in doing something intensively.
And since I am a musician myself and play saxophone, among other things, I founded a music AG with a colleague.
Well, and with time, that’s how our moderator, Lá<0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D>, takes care of saying something out of control (laughs).
But the band has only been known in recent years, or am I wrong?
It is true that the collaboration with well-known singers has helped us; in addition, we have also started to actively advertise for us.
We have become aware that when you do something and it is not visible outwardly, your own performance does not exist in a certain sense.
Thanks to the EU grants, we are also able to provide good readers, high-quality devices and so on.
Was it your goal to bring it so far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt the potential that you could approach things differently.
In showbusiness today, one often copies one another.
This is logical in its own way, since everything new is carefully considered and only accepted after a longer period of time.
There are just a few really unique things, and I dare to claim that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression the spectator usually has is of course compassion; that is only natural...
But this compassion is absolutely superfluous, because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings that we should regret.
They are people who can live a full-fledged life and evolve if they have the means to do so.
I always say that when people with disabilities succeed in something, it is not only a progress for themselves, but for the whole society.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss, as you hear from many people?
If you want to do something right, you must not compromise in many things and also require a certain discipline.
This, in my opinion, is completely normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and if they find that they have to take a test twice a week, complete preparation phases and spend a lot of time on concert trips, then the enthusiasm goes away for many quickly.
But that’s how it works everywhere, in every band that wants to work seriously and achieve something.
Currently, The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them have been involved since the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
There's only one person: Ladja Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D>.
We're an open group, people come and go, we can't stop that.
Anyone who has the will and the desire to participate is always welcome with us.
Taken place the day before the forecasted world collapse, Thursday, 20.12.2012 at 9 p.m.
The venues are: Incheba Arena/Prague, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three venues will eventually be connected to each other via live circuit, and a common interpretation of the anthem "Death of the World" by the band The Tap Tap is revealed.
The aim of the concert is to raise funds for the establishment of a multifunctional educational centre for disabled persons, which will be created under the name STUDEO at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute in Prague.
Entrance costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years of age free of charge, tickets are available in pre-sale at Bohemian ticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, Poland was admitted as the 20th member of the European Space Agency (ESA) at a Council of Ministers meeting of the European Space Agency (ESA), making it the second member of the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a member of the ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland began a close cooperation with the ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
Poland’s journey into space, of course, began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish space enthusiasts engaged in space travel, with which they did not always come to terms.
I remember here, for example, the lecture by A. <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld on December 6, 1933, at the Warsaw Observatory, where the author presented ideas from his pioneering work "Entrance to Cosmonautics".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the listeners cold, and after years <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld still remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
In 1934, <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld won the Prix REP Hirsch, founded by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for "Entrance to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important advocate of astronomy and space travel.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski’s world-renowned contribution to the development of spacecraft was appreciated, among other things, by the fact that one of the craters on the Earth-oriented side of the moon was named after him.
Already in 1925 a railway drasine was built in Poland, for which a rocket propulsion was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the draft and the details of this project remained unknown.
It is not yet clear whether the missile should be used to launch or brake the Draisine.
The information about this comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket-powered shootings.
The research was conducted by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustav Mokrzyckiegi.
From the submitted documents, it is clear that the research was advanced until the stage of practical tests.
The research was then freely interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937 appeared in the specialist press of the design of a photoelectric hunting missile from Ing. Rohozi<0xC5><0x84>ski, and the following year the work "Raketa - torpedo powietrzna i rakitobomba lotnicza" by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky appeared.
Both projects focused on the military use of the missile propulsion.
Shortly before the war, all projects for the military use of rocket technology were coordinated by the Interim Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy).
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of activity, its work was completed from the beginning of the war.
After the war, more articles on space were published in the Polish press thanks to the work of the Polish Space Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautcycny).
The first mention of this company is made in 1954 in the November issue of the journal Problemy, in which four extensive articles are devoted to space.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to establish a space company.
At the time, there were already the first projects on satellite technology, and it was anticipated that space exploration would have a future.
Already in its beginnings in 1956, the Polish space company PTA endeavoured to join the International Space Federation founded in 1951, and in fact, the PTA became a regular member already in the autumn of 1956.
The following year, the first PTA chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became deputy chairman of the International Federation for Space.
He held this office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has been instrumental in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (Raketa Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The missile with a maximum flight height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and weighed not quite 5 kg.
Later an improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and in 1959 began flight tests in the B<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>dow Desert with the two-stage rocket RM-2.
The missile was 1.4 m long and weighed approximately 11.5 kg.
Another stage of development should already be able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 should reach a flight altitude of up to 14.5 km and be used for the observation of altitude winds.
However, in 1962 the further development was stopped.
The Meteor-1 was the successor to the first RM-type rockets developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage missile, with a total length of 510 cm and a start weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed from these rockets, which differed in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A missile had a 0.4-litre transport space, Meteor-1B over 0.34-litre and Meteor-1C over 0.62-litre.
The maximum flight altitude for all three types was 37 km.
In the years 1965 to 1968, the Meteor-2 rockets were developed at the Institute of Aviation, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg at an altitude of approximately 60 km.
After that, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also worth mentioning Poland’s accession to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, followed by the establishment of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
Poland also participated in space exploration with Soviet satellites as part of the Intercosmos program, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslav Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after the Czech Vladimir Remek.
The repeal of the Non-Profit Labour Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Non-Profit Works Act.
This decision sparked a lively discussion in the public.
It is certainly interesting to look at the problem from a broader perspective.
The liberally oriented economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies are in a permanent conflict with each other.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with unrelenting financial speculation.
Due to the large differences in the value of labour (salary), there are price tensions.
This term is understood to mean a state in which the producer attempts to compete by importing cheap commodities into economic competition by "subtracting" competition in order to create a greater market share in itself and increase its profits.
On a large scale, this means for most companies to move their production abroad or buy cheaply there, or to give up their business, resulting in a high unemployment rate in countries with comparablely high labour costs.
Since private capital does not bear any social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment caused by it, government spending is necessarily increasing.
This situation is further reinforced by the fact that gentlemen entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thereby compensate for the overall economic and social damage caused by them.
This situation is generally known, so concrete statistics at this point are superfluous.
The reckless practice of private capital creates a situation in the individual economies in which governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population and thus attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments deliver their own populations, regardless of the social consequences, to private capital.
This is expressed in particular in amendments to applicable laws.
The aim of these measures is to force its own population to accept the dictatorship of private capital, especially in the field of wages.
This is done, on the one hand, by economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment, on the other by the reduction of workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as increasing differences between rich and poor.
For several years, there have been public food distribution offices in Germany for poor people who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of people affected is already in the millions.
As the competitiveness of the German economy increases, there are regularly cases where workers receive such a low wage that the state has to raise their income to the minimum level of existence.
Such a scandal was also uncovered in the case of auxiliary forces employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures will undoubtedly go beyond the same state in which people are forced to emigrate under the pressure of a catastrophic drop in their social level (as was the case in the 19th century in the country), or for a hunger wage that will be invested at the edge of society and at the edge of it.
Here, naturally, the question arises, where does this capital come from?
When it comes from another EU country, it is only poverty that migrates from one country to another; or capital remains the same, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt, or in Africa, workers are working for a fraction of European wages.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media up to the very end claim that the state cannot participate with capital in its own economy, and that the planning economy leads to an economic catastrophe.
Private capital strongly insists on its position that the state must not interfere in the economy.
But then one must wonder whether private capital does not influence politics and thus the whole state in its own selfish sense or even directs it.
Here is the clear answer: yes.
The proof of this is the existence of a virtually omnipotent lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the field of corruption, mutual preference, legislation in which virtually everything is striving, but nothing is punishable.
In Germany, the situation is such that a State Ministry of Finance lacks private, closely associated with the industry, law firms are tasked with drafting bills.
These bills are subsequently passed in the Bundestag.
All violence is then no longer based on the people, as the western constitutions proclaim, but on strong financial groups who prefer their own interests.
Apparently, liberal democracies are currently rapidly advancing into a situation, as Appian describes in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic in the days of Caesar and Pompey: "The state had long been in disintegration, and the offices were occupied by force.
Against lubricant money, by unlawful softening of advantages or with stone and sword.
The corruption was uninhibited, and the people went to the polls with the votes already bought" ... "People with character did not stand up for any offices, so the state did not have a consul for eight months as a result of this decline" ... "Man began to speak of the fact that the only one in the medicine was the only one who was the one who was the only one who was the one who was."
As it turns out, today’s society, as in ancient times, is based on the reckless preference of its own advantage, without regard for general social interests.
Private capital, by its very nature, is not able to recognize and implement the advantage for the whole society.
The result, today as at the time, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites, who are not at the least striving for deeper reforms.
We must therefore look for the cause of the rise of fascism and communism in the reckless liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
Given the current situation, the collapse of these regimes in favour of liberal democracies can be seen as a certain pause, with the next round already taking place.
Particularly disastrous is the fact that today’s elites face the possible loss of hundreds of thousands of lives in the future, the humanitarian and social disasters we are already witnessing today, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know them from older and newer history, in perfect contrast.
The repeal of the Non-Profit Labour Act is not a solution here, at least not permanent.
Under the pressure of global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to push the social level of the population down.
This trend is therefore system-related.
The only solution is targeted political-social reforms that increase the state’s participation in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on government, and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society in favor of the state.
Israel: Labor des Chaos.
"...that nothing arises from violence, or could ever arise," sings Sting in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in the refrain is: "...so that we do not forget how fragile we are."
“If my sons did not want war, there would be no war,” says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there were, as always, a number of reactions.
One stands behind Israel and argues with its right to self-defense while calling the Palestinians terrorists; the other, in turn, supports the Palestinians, argues with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and calls the State of Israel terrorists.
At this point, I do not want to write about who is in these recurring waves of killing the culprit and who is the victim; in the end, the inhabitants of today’s Israel, including the self-government areas, were born into the current political situation and did not have the beginning of violence itself.
I am concerned with opening the view behind the scenes to the readers, the view of whom the 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) are especially useful in the small spots of the country in the Middle East.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from these and are based on my own understanding of who or what group of people significantly influences the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is primarily a story of the struggle for power.
In every era we can make a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less obvious is the question of whether it was really always these personalities themselves who autonomously determined their steps, or whether there was someone behind their throne who directed their actions to a predetermined goal.
We must admit that we live in a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of fewer individuals, and that this concentration of money and the power that emerges from it has not arisen within the life span of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands out one particular one that could be called the head of the crater (I don’t know if anyone else is above them, but I don’t exclude this) – the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Understandably.
The first news agency (Reuters) was bought by the Rothschilds already in the 1990s to block the linking of their name to high-criminal acts, in the background of which they were always strengthening their power, increasing their wealth or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all the central banks in the world, and against the countries where they are not involved in the central banks, they are fighting wars or preparing for them (before the invasion of Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq there were only four countries, after the fall of the Ghaddafis remained in its place).
Whoever tried to confront this family had to pay for it with their lives.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the Rothschilds Bank of America as a central bank, began to issue his own (state) banknotes during the Civil War, and was murdered in a theater in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began issuing his own banknotes and wanted to abolish the FED - he was murdered in 1963; MP Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he tried to sue the FED for triggering the world economic crisis in 1929.
The Rothschilds' global desires for power led to the formulation of a plan to unleash three world wars by Albert Pik, a freemason of the 33rd and thus the highest degree of knowledge.
The aim of the first war was to eliminate the great monarchist statehood of Europe, the second war, in particular, should further break the colonial rule of Britain, and the third war should not absolutely reduce the world population to about 0.5 - 1 billion, and the use of such a number of people would certainly not reduce the world's population to about 0.5 - 1 billion.
The method by which the group of the wealthiest families works with the Rothschilds at the forefront is to trigger a crisis and then offer a solution (order ab chao – order out of chaos).
However, these solutions are wrong and always lead to the worsening of the situation (see the establishment of the FED so that crises such as those caused by them in 1907 do not repeat themselves).
After they succeeded in triggering World War I by the assassination of the Habsburg successor Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Russian Empire by the Bolshevik Revolution.
The First World War ended with the sudden, military and economically unfounded capitulation of Germany (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of the Russian Tsarist Empire), then the dissolution of the Central European Great Power of Austria-Hungary.
In order to be able to unfold the Second World War more easily, the bankers created by politics a latent conflict situation by occupying Germany with gigantic war reparations; thereby creating a prerequisite for the impoverished masses, so that they had to give the Germans only an easy solution, and they had to subjugate them with a sufficiently strong solution, and they had to subjugate the leaders.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the founding of the Zionist movement, in which a branch sought to establish a Jewish state, as far as possible in the historical territory of Judea with Jerusalem as the capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration, already mentioned, created the prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; there were first clashes with the settled Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler got rid of the chain where the international bankers initially held him, or whether everything went according to plan, it is only difficult to estimate, in any case the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the international community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and just as the war-repairs against Germany prepared the ground for World War II, the declaration of the State of Israel represents the creation of the focal point for World War III.
If the international bankers manage to unleash this war, the Jewish people will become victims in the forefront of World War II, this time together with the Arab or Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of conflict and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (only remember how sharply the people are divided into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim of the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis, where injustice only triggers injustice in an endless spiral of violence, with the greed of individuals and their striving for global power at the beginning?
It is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership here, but the international bankers in Israel, as well as us, the people, are putting their own candidates in the election.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, Falke Netanyahu, could be a typical example of a fascist politician loyal to international bankers, who is doing everything possible to unleash a war with Iran, who could only fight a war with Iran, who in the face of Iran's membership, it could be about 20 percent of the world, a global organization for cooperation, China, India, Pakistan.
David Rockefeller’s 1994 statement, “The only thing we need is an all-encompassing crisis, and people will welcome the new world order.”
In their imagination, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world in which every newborn is implanted at birth with a chip to subject this being to total control.
"And he causes all, the small and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, that no one may buy or sell, for he has the mark, the name of the beast or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom: the one having understanding, let him calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man and his number is six hundred and sixty-six.
For it is the number of a man, and his number is six hundred and sixty-six.”
The movie Argo: When It's Worst to Call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of demonstrating Islamist students occupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
For their release, they demanded the extradition of the fallen Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the United States after the revolution, which had kept the patronage over his regime for decades.
There was no positive way out of this situation for the American government - she could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, as this would have massively damaged the trust of her allies in other countries.
At the same time, she was unable to implement the liberation of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a heavy blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt to liberate hostages made everything even worse.
The captured diplomats were finally released after 444 days after negotiations were negotiated by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages at home highlighted a wave of solidarity as well as anti-Iranian moods.
Debacle in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter's defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo by director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story that gave the U.S. a small partial victory.
Just before the embassy was occupied, six embassy staff managed to escape.
This ended after numerous complications in the Canadian Ambassador's residence.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to bring the refugees out of Iran, helping them with an extravagant story to hide their true identity – they traveled blinded with Canadian passports as members of a film staff who allegedly rode in the country for a science-fiction film.
Combination of genres
The plan developed by the expert for "Exfiltration", Tony Mendez, also required Hollywood's cooperation.
To make the filming credible, articles about this film project appeared in journals, press conferences were held, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of this operation have been kept secret for a long time. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, he is a realistic political thriller, but at the same time also a so-called "Caper Movie", i.e. the story of a successful cast, such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
This changes the mood levels in the film - on the one hand the documentary scenes from Tehran (the title sequence shows iconic contemporary photographs, and there are no big differences in film footage of the same situations).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood that come ironically and easily oversized therefore.
And then there's the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions -- men in suits at the meeting table, on the office floor, on the phone...
Ben Affleck made a remarkable reboot of his career with this film.
A smiling actor has become a respectable director, and even as an actor he is no longer the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third film after Krimi No Children's Play (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the Thriller City Without Mercy (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck's first film not to play in the director's home Boston.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the place was one of the features that the previous films of this director overtook from the standard Hollywoods.
However, Affleck also proves this feeling in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that really took place - the initial sequence of the shock of the message is very impressive in its clarity, and still conveys the feeling of confusion and unpredictability.
A similar effect is achieved by Affleck with his team even in fictitious scenes (the wrong film staff on a basar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story does not actually offer many exciting scenes in the cinematic sense.
But with a few, he works quite successfully, sometimes helping out the reality – which doesn’t always seem so elegant (the scenes in which the threatening crisis at Tehran airport is diverted from a telephone call in America, or even the chase on the start-up track, seem somewhat disrupted).
The weakness of Argo is its too wide dispersion, which is due to the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood collaborators, but their characters deserved more space, and so they are far from alone in the film.
Affleck’s film loses some traction, which is a film that can be followed with a certain interest and with it the design and the retro style reminiscent of a thriller from the 1970s.
Enthusiasm, however, only arouses difficulty.
However, it is sufficient as a reminder of a piece of history still alive in some way to this day, and as proof of how overlapping the ideas of the omnipotent and omniscient intelligence services are.
Guidelines for blowing up balloons, for bananas and for the circus
The server www.bankonipoplatky.com, which annually surveys the most absurd bank fees, has decided this year to host the competition "Absurdest Regulation or Idea from the EU Workshop".
“This idea brought us to the EU’s recently presented plan to introduce a 40% women’s share in the management of large European companies,” Patrick Nacher, who takes care of the organisation of this survey, told the newspaper Právo.
Among the nominated absurdities is, for example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the uniformisation of insurance rates for men and women.
Until then, women enjoy a benefit in life insurance because they objectively pose a lower risk for insurance companies.
"Another incredible incidents from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will then take place until the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
Controversial EU regulations include the binding mixing of bioethanol with fuels, which is consequently harmful to nature, and the prohibition of reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively small amount of this hazardous substance, or even the amount of this substance, which is more likely to be in the same year.
Criticism in the past also raised the factual prohibition of the use of the term "butter scraping" or the prohibition of the sale of conventional light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The European Parliament often decides under pressure from this or that trade and industry lobby whose claims are usually represented in Brussels by one or more Member States (for example, the Czech Republic is currently trying to veto-threaten the claims of Czech banks).
Lobby interests also stood behind the fact that bananas of the highest trade class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and must not have a “curving anomaly”.
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it would only harmonise the non-uniform national standards that would hinder trade.
The rules on fruits and vegetables have already been softened by the EU against the resistance of some countries with the indication that the previous directives would lead to food waste.
A candidate for the victory in this survey may be the EU regulation from last year, which according to air balloons must be provided with the notice that children under eight years of age may not blow the air balloon without the supervision of an adult.
The EU referred to an American study, which, according to air balloons, is the leading cause of death of children.
A similar restriction already applies to children under 14 years of age when using annual market streets.
Curious incidents are also at home
Relatively absurd is also a directive that concerns the European officials themselves - anyone who has an official role in the EU may not use the name FYROM (former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) because of the sensitivity of the issue for Greece.
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, also nominated the EU regulation on the extent of food supplies in the territory of a Member State, in addition to the absurdities.
The EU thus set the maximum volume of food stocks that were allowed to be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our EU accession.
The Czech Republic then exceeds, for example, the specified volume for mushroom cans, for which we were threatened with a high fine.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for not having a sea, or by the idea of giving grants for applications for grants.
These ideas, of course, did not come from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by the fact that we do not have a sea.
We will be asked for a refund from the EU," said then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) in the autumn of 2004.
As an argument, he pointed out that the cereal harvests were very high and the state stocks were crowded as a result of so-called intervention purchases.
Since the Czech Republic has another way to seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros, according to Palas.
Finally, the European Commission welcomed the Czech Republic to the point where it organised a tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel N<0xC4><0x9B>mec (US-DEU), offered grants for applications for grants to the municipalities, specifically for the setting up of grants in Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
However, in the opinion of some experts, regulations are easily the target of criticism in the Member States, while the EU's efforts to regulate and thus also improve the effectiveness and development of the whole European Union are more likely to be recognized.
A more serious problem, according to these experts, is the EU funding for projects that have nothing in common with the deepening of European integration, but which have been forced by individual Member States in the negotiations on the budget.
Emotions in this country also highlight the fact that the Czech Republic, like other Member States in Brussels, has to fight for the right to use specific designations of traditional products and does not always win this fight.
Although the Czech Republic was able to defend the name "Olomoucké tvar<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xBE>ky" after a six-year battle with Germany and Austria, the domestic rum (Tuzemsk<0xC3><0xBD> rum) whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, however, our manufacturers had to rename it "Tuzemák".
The term rum may only be used for sugar cane distillate products, not for sugar beet products.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, the company of the world-famous cheeses Feta and Gorgonzola, the Lübeck Marzipan or the Parmaschinken now also includes the Karlsbader Zwieback, carp from Poho<0xC5><0x99>elice and T<0xC5><0x99>ebo<0xC5><0x88>, or the Saazer Hopfen.
With an EU trademark, the Pardubicer lebkuchen or the Ho<0xC5><0x99>icer rolls can be worn.
“People want me to save the Republic, but I’m just an amateur,” Okamura said.
Senator, how do you come up with the idea of running for president?
It’s not about being a senator or president.
If everything in our country worked without problems, I wouldn’t run anywhere.
But I can no longer watch the Republic being robbed for 20 years, how thieves walk around freely, while people are raising taxes and the retirement age.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something I don’t like, I try to propose a solution to change it.
And since I’m over 40, and independent and impartial, I have no other way to influence things than to run for the office of a senator or president.
In the Senate, you succeeded and then made yourself straight on the way to the castle.
Do you not turn your voters back?
I've been saying to myself all the time that I'm going to start the fight for the castle after the result of the Senate elections.
Later, I clarified this and said that I would run for the office of President if I was elected to the Senate.
But my goal is not the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
For this, I need as much influence as possible and a strong mandate.
The difficulty, however, is not only that we, as people in the cafe and in front of the TV, shy away from anyone who wants to change something.
In addition, the media who want to rob one of the honour and who confuse the freedom of speech with the freedom to lie.
About me, for example, it was claimed that I would cheat on journalists or that I was an advisor to Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
The battle for the castle was waged with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retroactive statements of property worth over 20 million kroner.
To do this, you need to change laws.
As president, you do not have any powers in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can make bills.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I endeavoured to ensure that the guide remains a free trade, and this could be implemented.
The problem is small-scale politics - if someone comes from the right or from the left with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and that only stops the population.
As an independent party eloquent, I have a much greater potential to gain support from all the parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I can take what is best for our country without drawer ideas and party ideals from any party.
Do you see yourself as a person in politics rather to the right or left?
From a Czech point of view, I think people are more likely to see me on the left.
But for me, this right-left thought is completely irrelevant.
It is important to me that we continue.
It’s not about whether someone belongs to the left or right camp; I want to connect people.
I always publicly support any good solution approach, even if it comes from the KS<0xC4><0x8C>M or the ODS, and I will also turn against bad ideas.
You don’t like it when someone calls you populist.
But are you not confirming this by what you just said?
When you create a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and vision.
And you want to get closer to that.
This can be called populism for me, but all the proposals I have spoken of are already working in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without the support of Parliament, you will have only keywords left.
In the long run, you will not get far in politics.
Or do you think that if you only talk to people long enough, you will succeed in enforcing, for example, material and criminal liability?
I don't have any other choice.
To persuade politicians, journalists, and the public, and to try to bring them to our side in order to achieve these goals.
As president, it would not be a problem for me to call on the presidents of parliamentary parties live on television to legally anchor the material and criminal liability of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And then, if they had to say, why would they refuse to do so?
A strong personality that points to misstatements can exert pressure on the political scene.
Take only once the direct election of the president, which was a merit of public pressure.
I say quite clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my views and visions.
I've just started with politics and I'm trying to find the support of the majority for my program.
I always try to judge things myself; and if it doesn’t work out, I will return to the private sector in six years.
That sounds like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that I am not accomplishing anything on my own; that is why I have talked to several well-known figures about whether they would also want to run for the Senate.
I have spoken, for example, to Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, who declined due to work overload.
In addition, I have supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencova, who discovered the scam in the light heating oil trade.
I started my candidacy with the assumption that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I’m not sure.
Sixty percent of the voters did not go to the election at all, and those who went to the polls mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
There are only two independents in the Senate.
People have chosen such a senate composition that amendments will only be very difficult to implement.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, for example for the direct election of mayors and district heads.
Are you thinking about setting up your own party?
I haven’t thought about it yet, because I don’t have time to check the past of any potential party member, and I don’t even have the money for it.
I don’t even have money for the presidential campaign yet; on my transparent account there are only 20,000 CZK.
You don't have any money?
Are you talking about property statements, what does yours look like?
My private equity is estimated at about CZK 60 million.
In Prague, I have a property worth <0x24>25 million, an apartment worth about <0x24>10 million, another for <0x24>8 million, an art collection worth about <0x24>10 million, as well as an Aston Martin worth about <0x24>3.5 million and a <0xC5><0xA0>kodu Superb worth about <0x24>1 million.
By the way, the Aston Martin was a child's dream - James Bond always liked him driving in the car, being gallant to women and fighting evil at the same time.
You drive an Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don’t want to invest your own money in it.
That's not exactly convincing.
I don't have <0x24>15 million for the campaign.
Am I supposed to make debts?
I have already invested 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don’t have sponsors shows that my program probably doesn’t attract too much interest.
And I am not obliged to defend the campaign from my own resources.
The cost of the campaign is basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I couldn’t live from the senator’s salary alone; so I couldn’t finance my son’s English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If I only wanted to make money, I would not apply for anything.
So do you continue to work as an entrepreneur to have your income?
Didn't you say you're going to drive these activities back?
But that doesn’t have to do with the salary level.
As promised, I have partially rebounded my activities.
For example, my alternate representative will become the managing director of the travel agency in the spring.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I also have to live from something.
What monthly income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that’s still the case.
As President, however, I would completely discontinue my activities.
The full conversation can be found in the Saturday edition of Právo.
The MVRDV architects prove that true adventures are not just in the mind - the example of Spijkenisse and the recently built Bucherberg - 2 photos
“I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there’s something interesting to see again,” says Lisette Verhaig, a passerine on the roadside.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT technician at a nearby large company, says, "Well, it's nice to see the house."
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone has internet, iPad and e-books.
No one volunteers to go to any of these old-style libraries today, right?
Spijkenisse, a barely-visited sleeping town in front of the Rotterdam Gates, is a remarkable record holder.
The community of 80,000 people has the lowest education rate in the whole of the Netherlands.
To counter this stupid situation, a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to the general education and to rebuild the seven fictional bridges depicted on the euro banknotes as beautifully pinned steel concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so the city fathers realized that there was only one way to become the master of statistics: a library must come up!
Winy Maas of the Rotterdam Architecture Office MVRDV, master of the cool beam diagrams and producer of funny, often cynical constructions, took the matter with usual calmness and appeared for the competition hearing in 2003 with five books under one arm and a grin.
And while the jury was still staring around and crawling with the axes, the freak Maas stacked his best pyramid of size towards a pyramid and ended his actionist-backed speech with the words: "Dear City Commune!"
So this is he, my proposal for the Book Mountain of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Book Mountain!
Nine years later, the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million mountain was demolished.
It is part of a revitalization project, which includes underground garages, supermarkets, post offices and a few adjacent residential and row houses with a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, the Bucherberg was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Thus, the faceless small town cake, which until now had no more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and a ugly town hall, behind whose white facades one would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory, to make a piece of contemporary architecture rich.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural construction in the history of its existence.
The long way to the book
First impression: Bucher Eldorado under cheese bells.
While there is an elevator that leads through the middle of the mountain massif, the true pleasures of space and reading unfold when the topography climbs on foot.
The glazed interior is bright and clear, the burnt clinker floor and the elegant street lamps clearly speak the language of a public city square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You are already looking for parkbank, dog and football playing boys and girls.
And everywhere books, books, books.
“Normally, the bookshelfs stand along the facade, and in the middle is a large, dark room that is mostly uncomfortable and impersonal,” says Winy Maas.
We put the classic room configuration on the head and polished the reading area from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the Bucherberg is skillfully used: in the center are offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental center and home engineering center.
A special joy are the black bookshelfs, which are sometimes wall coverings, sometimes brazing, sometimes sticking ropes.
Optics, haptics and smells are foreign.
Even intricate architects and construction engineers shake the head of the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work here with recycling materials," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, at the request of the standard.
And so, one day, in a Frisian farm, we encountered a suitable waste product from agriculture.
For many years in the Netherlands, a millimeter thin plastic foil has been used as a root substrate in greenhouses and fields.
This is cheap and time efficient.
The thin fabric lasts for two seasons, after which it is ripe for the scraping garbage.
For the library, the wool - for the first time in these amounts - was pressed to four centimeters thick plates.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) becomes a dark, homogeneous, load-bearing material that smells like new cars and sports shoes.
After 105 degrees, you arrive at the summit.
At the end of the almost 500-metre long hike, the literature café will reward you not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and pinned ficus trees.
They provide an atmosphere, but especially the right humidity in the literary mountains.
Donations for the new soul
“You wouldn’t believe it, but despite the many glass surfaces, this house is a showcase project in ecology,” says Trouborst.
Heated and cooled with geothermal heat.
Although the Bucherberg is under a glassfall, the sun itself on sunny days only appears briefly inside.
The wide wooden adhesives, which stand across the glass facade, serve as a coating and capture much of the sun’s radiation.
The air conditioning is very pleasant.
The rest is done by fully automatic rollers.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptic from the IT industry, had already dared to head to the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even calls the Boekenberg the "longest-overlooking soul" of Spijkenisse.
The reason: For the opening a few weeks ago, every resident was invited to donate a book from his personal inventory.
For the first time, the optical gaps in the not yet fully equipped library - currently 70,000 - are to be filled.
The concept has gone up.
The shelves are filled up to the top.
“Nothing is worse than a semi-living library,” says architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it's just for decoration.
With this, MVRDV has succeeded in that royal discipline, which is called in the specialist jargon Identity Foundation.
Spijkenisse has written literary history.
She may be so young and untrained.
This is finally an approach to identity.
Szabo: "Germans need to play a bigger role"
Germany participated in the vote on the inclusion of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert on U.S.-European relations, Berlin thus balances at a narrow diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany first signalled that it would vote against the request for Palestinian observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin came to an end.
- Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be careful because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don’t think it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence – but without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
It was eventually implemented by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is just turning its foreign policy away from a policy, which was said to have been managed by the United States, into a German foreign policy.
It is difficult to add that Europeans do not have a coherent and coherent policy.
The Germans find themselves between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still touching on their role, but they are on the way to a "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, like they have France or the UK.
What does a “normal” foreign policy actually mean from a German point of view?
It shows the willingness to take positions in national interests that are independent of those of the US or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany’s economic interests are, to a certain extent, different from those of the other great powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the attitude in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has large sales markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf States.
Therefore, it must be careful not to face the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries.
That certainly plays a role.
But I wouldn’t want to put too much weight on it either, that’s not a completely one-sided relationship.
But it certainly plays an important role in German thinking.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the United States by holding the vote on important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe and even in the United States there is a great understanding of the German position.
That is why I do not believe that this was such a dramatic breakdown as in the Libyan issue.
Perhaps Germany will even have some respect for it.
Because it signals that it is being taken seriously as an international player and its interests need to be taken into account.
There are different opinions in Europe about the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, on the other hand, has voted for a veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
Due to American domestic policy, these differences have always existed.
I believe that under Obama, in secret, the government probably has quite a lot of understanding of the European position.
But because of the political situation here, the government cannot, of course, publicly represent this position.
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not as large as they always appear.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, then Obama is not so enthusiastic about Netanyahu’s policy.
Is it difficult for Germany to agree on its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, and the position of the most important partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that's what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would of course be a little easier for the Germans to have a coherent and unified European policy, which is not the case at the moment.
So they can’t be part of a broader line and instead have to push things out of their own position.
This is exactly what they do with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will play a leading role in pushing Europe to a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, because of the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a delicate topic.
But I believe that the Germans are clear that they need to play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as an important international player – does Germany really want to take on a leading role?
Or is Germany still having a tough leadership role?
Germany is not used to it yet, that is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a larger role.
When we look at the euro crisis, for example, every time Germany takes on a larger role, various anti-German feelings are freed.
This does not make it easy for the Germans.
This is actually the old problem: you don’t want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be receptive to a wide variety of neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
Now that the influence of the US in European politics is continuously declining, the EU is not filling this void at the moment, who else will stay there?
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, it's unpleasant to them and it makes them much more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Marketing Protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-renowned brand, Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
What is Armani Polo?
Behind it is a name officially registered in China, which, however, has nothing to do with the originating companies.
However, it enjoys protection for as long as the actual nominees do not complain.
And even then it is not clear if they are right.
“It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at the Taylor Wessing law firm specializing in protection violations in remote areas.
Every week a new case lands on my desk.
The imitators are already given a few additional letters so that they can register their trademarks.
So Gucci is simply Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you can register Prada books.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, such as the sports equipment manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with registrations of the trademark office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company protected the Zegna DF Puma trademark, an art name that also served at the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese are world champions in copying and infringing intellectual property.
In the big cities there are multi-storey shops that sell almost exclusively counterfeit.
Pattloch’s cases, however, are different: on behalf of his clients, he opposes the Chinese company’s official right to use a designation already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", a passenger brand.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan".
This is meant for women who are rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
"That's business detrimental, you have to fight it," Pattloch demanded.
"The brand is blurred, the solitude disappears, the image damage is huge."
The financial failures and the process costs of the affected industries go into the millions, especially in the case of expensive display products.
According to market research company CLSA, China is the third-largest luxury goods market and the fastest growing with a volume of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 billion per year.
However, deletions of dubious entries in the trademark registry are difficult to achieve and go into the money.
The procedure can take up to nine years, with uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports cases in which the court rejected complaints because after the long term of the defendant's name became "market reality".
If the plaintiff is bad, he even has to pay the plagiarist money because he violated its trademark in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes there is the law of the jungle.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
Therefore, the Chinese are still allowed to use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.
Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue-white logo reminiscent of BMW; the dispute was settled, Geely had to change it.
Fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore who let the famous crocodile look in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing admits that there have been shortages in 2010 due to the lack of staff and space equipment.
Last year, however, the “emergency situation in the workflow has returned to normal.”
Thus, the stock of unprocessed opposition proceedings has decreased by 22 percent.
Almost 57,000 such cases have been completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
However, 81,500 complaints are still pending in the office.
Dealing with it costs a lot
As is often the case in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that for the tenth time in a row China is leading the list of new registrations around the world.
This also applies to the inventory of all valid trademarks, totalling 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan of fees were taken.
Simplified means that each registration costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
In contrast, it costs a lot, as the case of the German family-owned company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the group has been fighting a Chinese plagiarist.
Although the Germans were able to achieve that its illegal manufacture of imitated motor vehicle parts was removed.
However, the imitator continued to secure Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
This was missed, as family names could not be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialties in Munich.
The CTMO brand office also rejected the objection of the Munichers.
In the next two instances Freudenberg was right, but the opponent continues to fight to this day.
You have to be careful
The matter is now pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident in bringing the matter to a good conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The procedure is extremely complicated and costs us a lot of time, money, and nerves."
The internal costs were barely quantified, the company’s archive even had to review 100-year-old files to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the other side in vain a "high six-digit euro amount" for settlement.
"You can see how much that is worth to us," says Wentzler.
The dangers in remoteness are even threatening to swap back to Europe.
That is, if imitators there secure unprotected brands.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
This field of business has long been abandoned by the Group, yet it was able to bypass the registration.
“You have to be careful,” says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very cautious in dealings with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, rather, the foreigners should “apply everything that is somehow protective, even in China,” as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
In fact: If Freudenberg was subject to the last act of his brand drama, then the opposite side would probably have to pay license fees for its own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we will be pushed out of the market in the segment in question.
World Day: Stamping, Singing, Helping
In Heidelberg, the Choir Imbongi is trying – and in Swaziland, AIDS victims are excited about it.
The history of a connection that exceeds more than 8733 kilometers.
First there is the stamping: cowboy boots, basketball boots, women's pumps and men's lipsticks look for the pace on the parquet floor, find it quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Only then will the voices of the singers slowly swell – Alt, Bass, Tenor and Soprano – oppress, disturb and pursue.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost pulls it out of his fabric shoes when he brings it together with his softly wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Choir Imbongi will try a new song.
The fifty singers, aged 23 to 69, have come from the human geneticist to the houseman.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, every choral voice has a different text and this one is also in a very foreign language: Zulu, spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
There are around 34 million HIV-infected worldwide, which is estimated by Unaids, the United Nations AIDS Programme.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
There are 245,000 Aids in Swaziland.
More than 40 percent of the population is now HIV-positive.
For 180 Aids in the village of Esitjeni, the association Voices for Africa has found patents in Germany.
Seventeen of them attend a secondary school.
You can take a patent for 15 or 20 euros per month.
It guarantees the child school money, school uniform and a warm meal every day at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means Zulu storytellers or praises.
The Bantu language can speak fluently in this room no one but sing.
For almost a decade, the choir has been practicing songs in this foreign soft language and brings them back and forth to where they originated: in South Africa.
For 8,733 kilometers of airline from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the voice force of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected.
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple clay and straw huts, most of them are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they are infected with the HI virus.
Esitjeni is the smallest country in the world, where all of Swaziland is ill: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy worldwide, according to UNICEF.
Male prostate cuts, which have been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, are hardly accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of the people in Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus in themselves, dying in the middle of thirty is not a rare occurrence.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered the village, but above all, the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, who were lacking not only parental care, but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
Without graduation, you have no chance in a poor country.
At first it was the private commitment of the individual to send a child to school for a few euros a year and allow him to have a warm meal a day.
But just a year later, the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa", which has been taking care of the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni almost professionally since then.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and tripper (gonorrhoea).
Common viral STIs are HIV, human papillomaviruses, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Filament lice and crabs are among the parasitic STIs.
Who are the main stakeholders?
Syphilis and trippers occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four out of five cases of syphilis reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia infections, trichomonas, candidiasis, trippers, and human papillomaviruses are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The prevalence of HIV among heterosexual adults in this country is relatively low – yet: about 20 percent of HIV new infections fall into this group.
Chlamydia infections are significantly more common among adolescents than in other populations.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In this country, human papillomaviruses are also common among adolescents.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are required to report.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has more than doubled from 1,697 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has declined since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
That’s about a tenth less than the previous year.
What symptoms indicate a genital disease? <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, complaints when urinating, rash, lower abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
Often, however, they do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide 100% protection.
Because in part, triggers of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through lubricant infections and close body contact.
Therefore, experts especially recommend regular examinations for frequently alternating sex partners.
Early diagnosis most STIs can be cured and delayed follow-ups can be avoided.
Through patents, donations and not least the gags that the choir creates throughout Germany, a lot of things come together.
"In total, we have already sent around 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," said Annette Lennartz, the chairman of the association.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident and forceful woman, manages the funds from Germany.
She also takes care of the orphans well, with one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as the old women are called on Zulu, are the backings of the village.
Some of them have taken up to 14 orphans with them, giving them a roof over their heads, and making sure the children appear in their uniforms every day on time for school lessons.
Those who no longer have anyone come to the shelter to Khanysile, a single woman who is paid as much by the association as the two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, Voices for Africa has launched a sewing school, built two poultry houses and organised jointly with the American health organization PSI that many in the village will have an HIV test.
This is not a matter of course, because as obviously the disease is all over the country, one prefers to silence it dead.
A King with 14 Wifes
“Aids is an absolute taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with sexuality.”
Actually strange in a country where the king officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of Democracy.
Among other things, this state-sanctioned lifestyle is also due to the fact that the HI virus has spread so rapidly in recent decades.
But also the many hikers who carry the virus across the country.
There would be free condoms at every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are barely used.
“Culture is another – flesh to flesh.”
To promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels every two or three years together through South Africa and sings songs full of courage, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence that many of the southern tip of the black continent still know from the times of apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings mood and joy, but has already wiped out some gruesome border soldiers a few tears.
The journey always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their paternal grandchildren.
Although you can hardly find the small village on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni river it is more than known.
"Go to Esitjeni, there's the light," people say there.
And when you return the 8733 kilometres of airline to Heidelberg, to the staggering singers in the probe room on Bergheimer Straße, you can see the lights there as well.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The probe Messenger has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice cover may be up to 20 meters thick.
The U.S. space agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, there is also frozen water there, according to three studies published Thursday in the journal "Science".
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is an ice cover in the permanently shadowed region of the planet.
This should be at least 30 centimeters and possibly up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly even asteroids that are impacted on Mercury.
But no one is linking the finding of ice with the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help clarify how water and other elements of life have arrived in other parts of the solar system.
Unnoticed by Earth’s citizens, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix are exploring the depths of space.
From time to time, they send images to the Earth: Small holes in infinite distances.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits behind Neptune around the Sun, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the new definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This imagery of an infrared image of the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are to be identified as blue dots, more difficult to identify are the pink "newborns" in the star circle.
This star-forming region – unromanticly called W5 by scientists – has been discovered by the Spitzer Telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6500 light-years.
This glittering glow of a dying star has captured NASA’s Spitzer telescope.
The donut-shaped ring is made of material that the star spun out in the dying process.
In the huge Trifid Nebula, 5400 light-years from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer Telescope shot this photo of the galactic birth studio.
The Pleiadian constellation, also called "The Seven Sisters", can be seen at night with the naked eye.
However, with the telescope, the colors are better applied.
Like a red age, the Helix mist looks at the viewer in this infrared photo.
It is 700 light-years away in the constellation Aquarius.
Its resemblance to an earthly continent brought this mist the title of North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photo ensures the spectacular coloring.
This baby star could only be captured in its full beauty by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: How these originated is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
They may be the remains of a Saturn moon that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest images of the Hubble telescope: The Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on color, images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The footage released by the European Southern Observatory shows the several thousand light-years-old Trifid Nebula in the constellation Shield.
The name Trifid derives from the Latin word trifidus (three-split, three-split), since dark dust stripes divide the bright heart of the star birthplace.
In the constellation of snake carriers, astronomers have photographed the predictions of a cosmic carambolage: 400 million light-years away from Earth, the cores of two merging galaxies will inevitably collide with each other.
This star birth recorded the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Who does not have technical abbreviations, who likes to call it by its nickname Southern Firewheel.
The image from the Hubble Space Telescope shows an excerpt from the Iris Nebula in the constellation Kepheus.
The 1400 light-year-old mist consists of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was compiled from optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes 430 million light-years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, captured the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
Scientists call the larger spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this stellar nebula is the brightest group of young stars of our Milky Way.
The Star Wars always produces new youngsters.
Also, this star cloud, connected to the Rosette Nebula, is continuously bringing out new baby stars – 5,000 light-years away from Earth.
In this brightly radiant galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust yet, but only gas.
Researchers suspect that it originated shortly after the Urknall, when hydrogen was found predominantly in the universe.
Our insights into the whole: the most important telescopes
The telescope is said to have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey - even before Galileo Galilei used it for observation of the stars a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have become ever larger – and the insights they provide are ever deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
The Large Binocular Telescope is located in Arizona, USA.
It allows glances into the universe right over two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone comes to 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
However, it reaches a diameter of about 11 meters.
Disadvantage of favorable design: The telescope is fixed in its height angle - and thus limited in its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at altitude.
Its peculiarity: the high light-absorbing power.
This, despite its comparatively small mirror diameter, is enough to reach those of the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers hear all of it after alien signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing computing power.
View of the Observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here stands the Very Large Telescope - which makes his name all the glory.
With its four mirrors in total, the remote tube can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at ESO’s Chilean Observatory.
Its main mirror is intended to cover 42 meters - and is composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, images should be expected at the earliest in 2018.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They offer the same two mirrors with an average of ten meters each.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which is still looking into the sky next to them with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
A new, huge telescope is also expected to be built on the Mauna Kea - with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here it is to be admired in an illustration.
However, the most important impressions from space are provided by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, it has been providing images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets – mainly those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1235 planet candidates have been identified since the start of the mission.
The image documented the last launch preparations at the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be shot down on board an Ariane5 rocket by early 2018.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: It is intended to search for light from the first stars and galaxies after the Urknall.
Scientists assume that there is also ice on the southern pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data as the messenger orbits the planet much closer to the north pole.
Radar measurements have indicated for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
The Messenger probe launched in 2004 – the first to orbit Mercury – scientists now have certainty.
Drinking butter every day - and becoming 168 years old
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblical age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A trace search in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblical age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A trace search in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
The journey through the Talysh Mountains is called wild-dramatic.
The small bus runs across the curved road, past densely wooded hills, rippling rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you might think you’re in the black forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
This is where the Caucasian population of the Talysians lives, of which not much is known, except that it speaks perfectly Persian and Azeri and is very long-lasting.
Endstation is Lerik.
The small town boasts an architecture of Soviet times that is too much for the picturesque mountain scenery.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, too difficult is the access of Azerbaijan's capital Baku.
For the 323 kilometres it takes eight hours, because the road is only one-way.
The legendary wealth that the country owes to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilate Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the thing to do with the tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous with the Eurovision Song Contest in May - and next year we have a festival of the oldest people in the world," Fatulayeva says.
She is the director of the Museum for longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is documented the Vita of about eight dozen talismans from the area, which is older than 100. Fatulayeva shows on a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, another child was born
But the controversial star of the museum is Sheephirte Shirali Muslimov, who is said to be 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And given the oldest documented person, who was 122 years old, Muslimov’s age seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born here in 1805, he died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva.
The man had been married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136, he said he still had a daughter.
So did Shirali Muslimov calculate his age by a few decades?
But Rembrandt Scholz, age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard from the high-days in Central Asia.
"Attractively many high-altitude people are also present in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia extremely many very old men live."
However, due to the lack of evidence, there is no scientific evidence of age, especially since the status register is lacking.
Every day a cup of melted butter
The fact, however, is that the people of the region around Lerik are strikingly often reaching a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people who are over 100 years of age.
Why are there so many holidays in the south?
The Azeri travel guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talysians.
Museum Director Fatulayeva, on the other hand, believes that it lies in the diet.
However, the fact that calculated the calorie-rich diet of the talys is so healthy that they love meat, bread, and especially dairy products, and many of which drink a glass of melted butter daily, from a nutritional point of view does not seem exactly plausible.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? Rubaba Mirzayeva lives in Cengemiran, a small settlement near the town of Lerik.
At 97 years old, she is still relatively young for these widths.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house that is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a butterfly that she tirelessly rolls down and down.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva’s sons and one daughter, both of whom have long been grandparents.
Two small children are also jumping around.
In the kitchen, guests can prepare tea served in the typical, belly-shaped Armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva’s white teeth stand perfectly in line and limb, under her thigh she hides long, dark blonde dolls, which her son proudly reveals to us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so they never left me and kept their color.
"I've never used shampoo," Mirzayeva says.
Monthly pension is enough for life
She has always eaten only what came from her own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life I haven’t bought food in the supermarket.
Then she tells of her husband who was in the army.
The worst was in the post-World War II period.
But everything got better when the "loved father" Heydar Aliyev took over the rudder.
Propaganda sounds strange from an old woman's mouth.
But the cult, driven around the paternal figure of the nation that ruled his country like a dictator, knows little about borders in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, and later his son Ilham took over the Ruder.
After all, there is no need among Azerbaijan's old.
230 manat (about the same amount in euros), Mirzayeva receives a monthly pension, for local conditions, an amount from which one can live well.
And maybe Mirzayeva’s longtime son was right: “The old people enjoy high respect in our culture.”
They live in the middle of the big family, are loved, cared for and are happy.
If this is no reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word "human rights" is lacking in the Constitution.
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Competitive environments in Cairo reveal the country’s deep division.
The future constitution with the Sharia as the basis is fiercely disputed.
The Egyptian president did not spare with Pathos.
We need to make the transition.
"And that he succeeds lies in my responsibility, in front of the people and in front of God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, but especially to the Christian Copts, the liberals, enlightened Muslims and seculars.
For all of them, so far hopelessly disputing in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a state of God on the Nile of Grace of the mighty Muslim Brotherhood.
He, he said, almost apologizing, temporarily reduced the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded his powers "to save the revolution".
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctoral degree from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, the Egyptians are over it, the world is not entirely clear.
Should the judiciary be dismantled?
In fact, the 234 articles pierced by the Islamist-dominated 100-member Constituent Assembly during a nightly, 15-hour parade are partly alarming.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also states that the jurisprudence is based on the "Principles of Islamic Law".
But what does "principles" mean?
This was and is a matter of interpretation, and it is to be feared that the Islamists will use the spongy formulation and the associated legal playing space for a stricter interpretation of the Sharia.
This suggests at least one newly added article: In all matters relating to Sharia, the Al-Ashar University must be drawn to be the country’s most important Islamic institution with great radiance throughout Sunni Islam.
That does not have to be, but it can mean that the clergy oversees the legislation, which would de facto result in the dismissal of the judiciary.
Much in the draft constitution is a matter of interpretation
Also problematic: Civilian justice should continue to be maintained.
These courts were used during Mubarak’s reign to suppress opposition.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
The state should also "protect the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promote their morals and values".
This is legally so blurred that state institutions could even control the contents of film art and literature with the help of this article.
In the clear text, this means nothing but censorship.
By the way, no article explicitly states the equality of men and women.
For this reason, another forbids insulting or slandering the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what is an insult and how it should be avenged remains unclear.
Similarly, dubios encourages the wording that “insulting people” is prohibited.
Is there enough of a caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of a lawyer?
A matter of interpretation, as so much in the draft, that Mursi is present for signature and, according to his words, will be presented "very soon" to the Egyptians for the referendum.
"The Revolution is Back"
The opposition has been forming for weeks against the overpowering of Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in unprecedented enthusiasm on Friday night at the Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to bring down the Charter before it could enter into force.
“The revolution is back and we will win,” Hamdin Sabbahi, third-placed presidential candidate, said.
The Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, said the draft constitution belongs to "the garbage mountain of history".
Through Twitter, he told supporters of Mursis that he wanted to lead a “push against democracy.”
“When he calls for the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him,” opposition leader Jasser Said said.
“We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet shed,” Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Chaled Ali as saying.
And several judges announced that they did not want to monitor the referendum, making it invalid.
"The Qur'an is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, for its part, flew to the opposite demonstration, but with caution, not on the Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other Nilufer in front of the University of Cairo.
Many concealed women and followers of the Salafists took part in it, shouting, "The people demand the application of God's law."
They asked Mursi, "Clean the land!" and said, "The Qur'an is our constitution."
A struggle for the supremacy over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything took its beginning, would probably have sparked civil war-like conditions.
Obviously, Mursi’s supporters didn’t want to risk that.
The Muslim brothers stated that both the opponents of the draft constitution and the supporters had expressed themselves loudly and clearly.
Now is the time to let the people decide in the polling station in which direction the country should go.
A majority for the design of the Islamists is considered safe.
"The word "human rights" doesn't even happen."
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this enforced constitutional process, which actually should have gone by February and should involve all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers while they were in prison or in court under Mubarak.
Not because he would share their worldview, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For this, he was beaten, convicted, imprisoned.
"And now the word human rights does not even appear in the new constitution," he complained in a conversation with the "World on Sunday".
Mursi's extension of power to all three powers in the state allowed the lawyer to resign.
These measures are flagrant violations of democratic rules of play and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President de facto puts it out of effect," Saeda complained.
But without civil society organizations, a democracy can’t work.
Saeda feels alone, even from the international community, which looks at the ideological struggle of direction on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could take revenge.
A protester on the Tahrir warns, “You are carrying a monster that you can no longer control.”
Rakfish from Norway: Is it the most malicious fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living - not only in Europe, but worldwide.
Could the secret of the country’s success have something to do with the local appetite for rather nasty fish?
There is a selection of overgrown cheeses.
You place them in the middle of a bunch of dirty, damp sportswear.
And leave them there for a week.
So, you have to imagine the nasal smell of Rakfisk, one of the great delicacies of Norway.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There’s snow, spectacular landscapes here – and this stubborn smell in the air that just doesn’t want to disappear.
Rakfish is salt-treated forelle, which - depending on how stinky you would like your fish - is fermented in water for up to a year.
When the darkness comes over the country in Norway and the weather gets colder, Norwegians stream to a party here in Fagernes, which is dedicated to this, now, really very boring specialty.
"You eat it raw and then rinse it down with a glass of Aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local fire department, but also hosts the festival as the so-called "Rakfisk General".
People around us consume small fish cubes and consume large amounts of alcohol.
"Many people like the Aquavit more than the Rakfish," says Havard.
The spirits can distract the smell.
I cost a few bucks.
When you avoid bringing the rakfish near your nose, it’s not bad – like sushi, which has a pretty long bus ride behind it.
Rakfisk is the product of a completely different, far poorer Norwegian era, when there were no cooling options and fish was immersed in airtight saltwater vessels in the fall.
In the deepest winter, it was then taken out after a long fermentation and consumed - undoubtedly with the help of alcohol dampened senses.
Even a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and migrated mainly to the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly – more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a thriving labour market, high wages and a comprehensive health care.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, who was not too long ago richer than Norway, flows immigrants.
Rakfish is considered to be an important part of Norwegian history – an essential, albeit highly fragrant, part of Norwegian history.
It is one of the most expensive dishes you can buy here.
But in fact, everything is expensive here - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proudly 10 euros.
Norway doesn’t often get into the world press, and most people don’t seem to bother.
Here it is still hateful to name Anders Breivik by name - those racist right-wing extremists who shot 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, we refer only to the “July 22 incident”.
Norwegians find it hard to accept that someone in their peaceful country is capable of such brutal murders.
Since the early 1970s, the growth of one of the world’s largest oil and gas industries has been responsible for Norway’s current wealth.
“But oil isn’t the only reason why we’re doing so well,” says Anna, our waitress, who distributes round tablets with ripe raspberries and embodies the Nordic ideal with her long blonde hair and stunning blue eyes.
We are, as they say, a cautious people.
Your English is just like most people here are perfect.
We're not very ingenious, we don't like talking.
Norway has been very cautious about its oil wealth – a large part of the industry’s revenue is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When, in the years leading up to the global economic crisis, everyone was throwing money that they didn’t own, Norway kept its wallet tightly closed.
"As long as we can ski in the winter and hike in the summer, we are happy," Anna says.
"And of course eat rackfish," she adds with an unpleasant laugh.
I stand in the snow and prepare for another dish - from Rakfisk I have enough.
An elk burger like that is definitely something else, the juicy meat is good for me.
But in the evening, the stink fish is on the menu again.
The hotel where I lodge is one of several venues organising a rakfish dinner, where guests can vote for the best – or perhaps the most challenging – fish snout.
There is a live TV circuit to a showmaster dressed in flies, surrounded by plates with rakfisk.
The show is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Havard".
You're smiling and laughing.
A man falls from his chair, possibly overwhelmed by the Aquavit.
But perhaps it is the strict darkness of the whole fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto is facing a difficult start
As Mexico’s future President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, Will Grant from the BBC analyzes the challenges ahead of him and the mixed feelings of his people.
Currently, the traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad.
Even on better days, this is a always clogged city, but on Monday a steel ring was built that blocks several important traffic routes to the capital and causes chaos on the streets.
The goal, however, was not to disturb pedestrians on the way to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico’s new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidency and take over the leadership of the nation.
He is faced with a complex task.
Under the divorced government of Felipe Calderons, Mexico has been able to prove itself economically well, but the country is facing a drug war that has already cost 60,000 lives in the last six years.
"My government is strongly committed to reducing violence," Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama earlier this week at the Oval Office.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before joining the U.S. president, Pena Nieto served as governor of his home state of Mexico.
In this densely populated, far-reaching part of the country that surrounds the capital, the opinions about the new head of state are shared.
A direct man
In the remote small town of Valle del Bravo, for example, one likes to remember him.
Residents of the holiday resort attribute it to the development of tourism and the construction of the infrastructure.
To reach the city, you can drive on one of the highways that Pena Nieto built and represent a great improvement over the broken, hilly roads that once existed here.
Plaquettes with its name also hang outside a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect real and lasting changes from him," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as a congressman for the Peña Nietos party that PRI.
In particular, with regard to security and the economy, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country needs so urgently.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, the party has high expectations for Enrique Pena Nieto.
The accusations of the opposition, the new president lacking substance, he rejects.
He is a very direct man, very committed and has great plans for the country.
He is an excellent statesman, but above all, he is also someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, not many people share this view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The place is hidden under highway transmissions and in many ways is a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of a decisive urban nature.
Earlier this year, the military was deployed to combat drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
In the last two years alone, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left on a stain of land near a large garbage depot.
During the tenure of Governor Pena Nieto, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico - a statistic that surpasses even the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is famous for its violence and the murder of innocent women.
Critics Pena Nietos feel that he has at least not addressed the issue of women’s murder during his tenure.
But in the worst case, his government has closed its eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typical of the downhill neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles with tears when she shows me pictures of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that she was murdered by her life partner.
“When I arrived at her house, it seemed as if her body had been washed,” recalls Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the body star had already used.
As her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down on us from the wall. It is attached next to a cross that bears one word: justice.
But this, the family, has been denied so far.
The authorities have treated me as if I were a whistleblower, a rioter, a nurse.
You just want to accept your judgment and keep your mouth shut.
“But that’s not possible if there were so many form mistakes and omissions,” she says.
When President Pena Nieto receives the presidential nomination on Saturday, he also assumes a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been pitted over the past six years by violent crimes, and the new president has promised to take care of this problem especially during his tenure.
"I hope as president he is the same as he was when he was governor," said PRI Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But that is what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza are most afraid of.
Prosecutor’s Office says Bradley Manning has not complained about abuse
Attorney General Bradley Manning's allegations that he has been abused in prison
The hearing deals with Manning's time in military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defense aims to reject the charge due to harsh conditions of detention
U.S. Army Release Is Accused of Disclosing Thousands of Confidential Documents
The prosecutor’s office on Friday tried to find that Army-free Bradley Manning — accused of the largest disclosure of confidential information in U.S. history — missed several occasions to complain about the alleged abuse he committed in military custody.
At Manning’s cross-examination during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Maj. Ashden Fein explained that documents on weekly visits made by prison officials during Manning’s nine-month detention in Quantico, Virginia, did not show any complaints about his treatment.
A day before the cross-examination, which was held as a result of a request by the defence to dismiss the charge – Manning had already been sufficiently punished by the hard detention period – Manning had said that he had considered suicide in prison.
The U.S. military intelligence analyst, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as the source of the information.
In the hearing on Friday, Fein and Manning passed the forms that officials had filled out after their meeting with Manning during his detention in the Quantico Military Prison, where he had entered from July 2010 to April 2011 under increased conditions of detention.
The officials asked Manning questions and wrote down his answers.
When Fine asked him about the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had judged the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the facility as "very professional".
The forms, so refined, contained no complaints about abuse, although officials had asked Manning directly about his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally and the officials had discussed them with him and indicated to deal with them, but they had not been recorded.
"They wrote (after meeting the concerns) 'No problems,' and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't say anything at all," Manning said.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he didn’t complain about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011 to investigate the suicidal thoughts he mentioned a few months earlier on a form.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting was to reduce his observation status to “prevention of injuries.”
The military said it had assigned him this restrictive status – which is a level of suicide threat – to his and the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince employees that I was doing well, and get rid of the observation status to prevent injuries (...) to achieve a higher quality of life from my point of view," Manning said.
Manning said on Thursday about his arrest and detention in Kuwait, where he was detained for about two months before being transferred to the prison of Quantico Marine Base in Virginia in July 2010.
He said in Kuwait he had considered suicide and had become unconscious due to the heat.
Not knowing what is going on with him or in the outside world has been a burden.
"My world shrinked on Camp Arafjon, on this cage together," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I'd die in this cage.
When moved to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell – at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours – and without company.
He was only allowed a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothes and his glasses.
Manning said he tried to stay in motion because on the day it was forbidden to sleep or just lie down.
He always had to sleep with light that penetrated his cell from the outside.
When he turned around at night and could no longer see his face, he was awakened so that he turned back.
In January 2011, Mannings's lawyer formally raised objections to Mannings' treatment.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to the military prison of Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, Judge Manning also questioned a charge he had raised in his statement on Thursday — so he had to sleep naked one night in his cell in Quantico and must stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners at a morning count.
Manning had stated that during this counting he had never had the opportunity to cover himself with his ceiling.
During the interrogation on Friday, Manning admitted that he had been ordered by his guard to drop the ceiling he could have covered himself with, but he admitted that no one had asked him to do so.
Manning said on Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before, and had previously tried to show an official that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning told the official that he could have used the ligament of his underpants or his flip-flops to hurt himself, but he did not.
That night, Manning said, his underpants, flip-flops and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least consider his experiences of imprisonment and drastically reduce his level of imprisonment, should he be convicted in his trial before the military court, which is set for the beginning of next year.
The defense has stated that Manning will plead guilty to minor offences, while other allegations deemed too extreme should be challenged.
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend. The Prosecutor's Office is expected to justify the conditions of detention.
The Pentagon maintains in its position that Manning has been detained in accordance with the provisions applicable to all prisoners held under the highest security measures in Quantico.
The allegations against Manning include favoring the enemy, illegally publishing intelligence on the Internet, transferring national defense information, and theft of public property or documents.
If he is found guilty in all charges, he will be sentenced to life in prison.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis.
Many people are forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunities.
Mexicans tend to blame emigrants - they call them hard times in their memory, he says
Navarrete believes Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at the passport check when mischief spread in me.
Signs refer to two waiting strings: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds, uncertain where to go.
I grew up in Central California and have been called "Mexican" my whole life.
An ethnic shortcut - just as my friends in Boston call themselves "Irene" or my friends in New York "Italian".
Later, I chose "Mexican-American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather’s home there was no need for shortcuts or ties.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to assert myself in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I don’t have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and my American accent is not going away either.
So I took my American passport and put myself in the trap for extraterrestrials.
I thought about that moment this week when the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
The agenda included all those issues that one would expect when the heads of the two countries met: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is a reason why Mexicans today are equally likely to stay in Mexico rather than emigrate to the United States.
He wants to ally himself with the United States and Canada and create a North American trade bloc in the role of the European Union.
And Pena Nieto vowed to continue Mexico’s war against the drug cartels, even though he did not mention any details about it.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never waste a single thought of the fact that the United States entered Mexico in 1848 and forced the country’s leadership under gun control to leave more than half of their territory to them.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not in minutes, memories of this event cannot be overlooked.
So once an official of the U.S. government exercises even the mildest criticism of Mexico, one hears – in the Mexican press and among the country’s elites – complaints about how Americans oppress the sovereignty of their neighboring country.
And the children of Montezuma are on the war path.
And yet Mexico’s biggest challenge lies in fact in its relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Want to talk about resentments?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason why so many people of Mexican descent live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at some point in our tree, a person - perhaps a parent or grandparental part - did not get a chance in Mexico and headed north.
And in most cases, this person corresponded to a profile - dark-skinned, untrained, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty is to them.
Not Mexico.
And although we may now live the American dream, have attended good schools and got good jobs, we must never lose sight of the American dream we live – not the Mexican one.
Our identity may sometimes disappear, but as far as our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.
This clearly applies to the United States.
In addition, we are aware that we do not like many members of the Mexican leadership.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In your opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And then we wouldn't be caught behind the silk curtain - with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally immigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans take those.
While she is a U.S. citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know feel like they don’t belong to either country or any other country.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You enjoy the best of both worlds, but none of them is rooted in them.
In Mexico, we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we are seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my journey, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: Some Mexican leaders and parts of the educational bourgeoisie want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want to employ Mexican Americans as provisional "ambassadors" for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues how great it is to visit this country and put pressure on the political leadership to intensify their ties to Mexico.
Well, now.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And given the unfair distribution of income, unbalanced corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure if this is really a great country.
I'm afraid you'll have to go through that alone, Amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico a century and a half ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans have a grudge about how their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're "mexican" more than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected pillar of peace
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to suffocate such hope in the seed.
In the midst of the usual allegations, countless buildings were laid in ashes, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis killed — and rockets from Gaza were first struck near Israeli metropolis Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historical conflict, the Middle East around them is changing.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of these wires.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly patch situation could finally end.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism seems to be anything but appropriate in view of the current situation.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on November 21, the struggles this week have strengthened the hardened on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have pushed back the Israelis, even though its own group had to suffer major losses.
Although several Hamas leaders have been killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip have been stranded in one of the most devastated and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has so far failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is winning in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders could conclude that they have time on their side.
As Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has been able to draw powerful and wealthy friends to its side.
Turkey, a reinforcing regional power once regarded as Israel’s closest Muslim ally, has taken over for Hamas – just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Hamas supporters believe that there is an Islamist hemisphere around Israel – from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hezbollah has power, to Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist character could stand in front of the collapse of Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas is in power.
In particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt – the most populous and most important Arab country in the distance – on the southern flank of Israel has changed the equilibrium of the region sustainably.
Hosni Mubarak, the laizist despot who ruled Egypt until its fall in 2011, had little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, the fraternity with Hamas is swamped and its leaders are more dependent on people’s views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be an actor that cannot be pushed out by Israel and the United States itself.
The Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, make the opposite conclusion.
Militaryly speaking, Hamas is no longer a threat.
Israel’s missile defense system, “Iron Dome”, has proven itself and many of Hamas’ missiles have been destroyed.
At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep more calmly.
From a diplomatic point of view, the United States holds firmly to its position, and many European countries have made Hamas accountable for the latest escalations of violence.
Israel has been doing well in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
However, although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed some 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers - not least thanks to the blockades that have been carried out in the West Bank and thus into the main part of a Palestinian state.
His Likud party has allied itself with an even more militant group under Avigdor Lieberman in advance of the January 22 election.
Why are these reckless Palestinians smiling and leaving their own state to them?
If they really had control of the West Bank, wouldn’t they fire missiles just like their counterparts in the Gaza Strip?
No, it is better to keep them behind the wall in chess and punish them if they dare to raise their heads.
Maybe the hardliners will be able to implement themselves, but the Arab Spring could make a mark on them through the bill.
Even if the Islamists now in power in Egypt and other countries have little left over for Israel, they will initially focus on the difficulties in their own country.
Israel’s defense law is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors together.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to restore their economy.
The fact that the pragmatic President Mursi is working with Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire could be a promising sign – and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should also think long-term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking decisive steps towards democratization, Palestinians continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination – a powdered constitution that will undoubtedly one day explode in the Israeli-occupied territories, just as a bus in Tel Aviv exploded this week.
The oppression already undermines democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population this situation will only intensify.
Bloody missions to suppress Hamas in the Gaza Strip will increasingly demand their diplomatic tribute over the years.
Both sides need a push from the outside
The correct answer is those represented by the most reasonable representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world, and by this newspaper: two states in which Israel withdraws territory for security purposes.
The - small - hope for the near future is that the ceasefire will give more influence to outsiders in order to enforce this solution.
Egypt must now, together with Turkey and Qatar, stop arms supplies in the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever before to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by a territorial exchange and a common Jerusalem.
Outside Arab nations should also move Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would have done more for the creation of a Palestinian state than for the upcoming application for UN observer status.
Obama must also contribute his part to moving Israel to negotiations.
During his first term of office, he missed the idea of his own peace plan.
Far away in the White House, it seems that he is also distracted by a stake.
But this is a sad, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a significant interest in a stable Middle East.
And this includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australia's Single Cigarette Packaging Laws Go Into Effect
Health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packaging that are the same for all tobacco brands
The world’s first laws for unified packaging of cigarettes and tobacco have come into force in Australia, replacing brand logos and colours with neutral olive green lids, which are also printed with drastic images, sick body parts and children’s cigarette smoke.
Apart from the various health warnings and pictures, from next Saturday the only difference between the packaging in the brand names printed in identical, small fonts will exist.
As a result, Australia introduces the world’s strictest regulations for tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government wants to discourage young people from smoking by eliminating the glamorous image of tobacco use.
Studies have shown that people who have not started smoking at 26 years of age are 99% more likely to not start smoking after that.
"You can already see in young children that they understand the message of trying to promote tobacco companies with their brand image," says Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek. She quotes studies that have shown, for example, that children the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will only have a slight impact on the profits of multinational corporations, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
It was said that the laws would favour black market trade, leading to cheaper and easier access to cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer much larger quantities of these products on Australia’s roads.
Others, on the other hand, say that the laws have boosted their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, notes that the demand for cigarette nets and silicone lids to cover the intolerable packaging has increased enormously since the British American Tobacco Group, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan have been dealing with two of the tobacco companies.
Zico has sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale stores and is waiting for new stocks.
This is a good deal for us.
According to experts, the popularity of social media lies precisely with the population to which the plan is aimed.
A number of Australian laws have banned tobacco companies from TV advertising, prohibiting them from appearing as sports sponsors, and forcing most dealers to stop smoking in stores. Now tobacco advertising has changed to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned internet advertising by local companies and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
“Those who market tobacco and have only a small area left to promote their products don’t come around the internet,” says Becky Freeman, a researcher in health at the University of Sydney.
On social media like YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook, Freeman has seen an increase in experience reports about brands written by “all-normal people.”
You have to ask yourself the question: is it just a private person who finds such great favors to Marlboro cigarettes that they even make a video for it - or does a marketing agency have to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says the industry is focusing on marketing instead of dealing with the new laws.
It has even gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to fight the new regulations – those countries are complaining to the World Trade Organization about unfair trade restrictions, although none of the countries is engaged in greater trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected in mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has held talks with other countries considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to prescribe photographic warnings in 2001.
In the meantime, these have been expanded to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Harder laws are being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
There are many Australian smokers who do not smoke.
The pictures don't affect me.
I just ignore them.
"You just pick up a tie and put the box away," says Victor El Hage when buying a cigarette box on which a photo is printed with a mouth tumor.
Honestly, there’s only one reason I’d stop, and that’s my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the tobacco store "King of the Pack" in downtown Sydney, says the uniform packaging has made it difficult to fill its shelves.
“I used to take an hour to sort out a delivery, now I need four,” Yu says.
"The government should have just banned cigarettes completely - then we would have said okay, that was, we're closing," he added.
In a constantly electrified world it is nice to be bored
This Thanksgiving I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane crashed due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane.
So I had enough time to make a few thoughts about boredom.
I don't want to lie.
Waiting half a day at the airport for a flight is pretty nervous – even when books, magazines and iPhones (and of course tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts are leading boredom rather than something positive.
When it comes to them, it's okay for us - and our children - to be bored occasionally.
As a result, the brain is forced to get lost in interesting thoughts, which may promote creativity.
And because most of us nowadays almost constantly stare at one screen or another, the benefits of boredom no longer benefit us.
So should we welcome the boredom with open arms?
Yeah. Yeah.
And no.
I'll come back to that again.
Like many people, I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively current phenomenon that has evolved with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) doesn't see that.
"In fact, the boredom has a very long history," he says.
The walls of Pompeii adorn a Latin graffiti about boredom, dating back to the first century.
And then there’s the question of how we actually define boredom.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York, Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that boredom can be defined as the experience of wanting to perform a satisfactory activity but not being able to do so.
So slowly, apathy differs from apathy in that the person is not busy, but wants to be.
In apathy, on the other hand, there is no urge to do anything.
The key experience of boredom, he says, consists in a “disturbance of the attention process, coupled with bad mood and the feeling that time is only passing slowly.”
It can almost sound like depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes that although these two conditions may be related, depressed people see the problem in their surroundings or the world, while depressed people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think that we are bored, even when we just have trouble concentrating.
In her study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - in German for example: "The inactive mind: The definition of boredom under the aspect of attention", which appeared in September in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science", refers to a person, a part of a person, a member of a group, to a member of the group, and a colleague of his colleagues.
Some groups heard a loud TV show from the neighbouring room, which had nothing to do with the content, while others heard it at low volume, so it was barely noticeable, while the third group did not hear these sounds at all.
The people who missed the barely audible TV said they felt more boredom than the other two groups — they had problems concentrating, couldn’t find a reason for it, and attributed their difficulties to boredom.
If one tries to focus on a difficult or demanding task, the disruption of attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neuroscience at Guelph University in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, exercising a one-tone activity - "such as searching for faulty products on a factory conveyor belt, music can distract and help you not to feel bored."
In fact, he says, we now know that chopsticks and crickets, often interpreted as signs of boredom, can even fight them by staying physically more alert.
“Studies have shown that children who are allowed to walk around learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still,” says Professor Fenske.
We all get bored at some point - my late flight, a roaring loudspeaker, a particularly tiresome film.
But some people get bored more easily than others.
To measure these differences, in the 1980s, researchers developed a "scale of vulnerability to long-term vulnerability".
On the scale there are statements such as “Many things I have to do, repeat and are monotonous” and “I have so many interests that I don’t have enough time for everything.”
Using such scales, researchers have found that boys become bored more often than girls, says Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida - in particular, regarding the need for more and a greater variety of external stimuli.
But in general, teens are a rather tense bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager.
He found that 32% of adults were bored in school and doing homework, while 23% said they were bored if they weren’t in school.
However, only 3% of parents said they felt bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he does not know whether the percentages in terms of boredom have increased or decreased.
However, he is confident that "youth will feel particularly boring", mainly because children and teenagers do not have a major influence on their daily life.
So back to my question of origin: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases, it causes people to take extreme physical risks and fall short of gambling or drugs to relieve them – studies have shown that.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors explore the relationship between boredom and creativity, which is the opinion of Professor Vodanovich, who has been exploring the subject for more than two decades.
“In the long run, the brain wants to tell one that one should do something else,” said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn’t always know what to do best.
When you’re bored and you use this energy to play and cook guitar, you’re happy.
However, while television can provide feelings of happiness in the short term, they are fleeting in the long term.
So, if your child has enough iPad, it can distract him from being bored, but he hasn’t learned to entertain or control himself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: "Self-control transfers from one situation to another."
The child not only learns to entertain, but also gains more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate boredom.
We should also not be too critical of them.
Instead, our goal should be to feel at ease, even away from the constant excitement of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we have to be bored more often, but the agonizing, unbroken desire is to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that people in truth are only looking for a way to turn off and relax.
“In an environment where we are constantly being overstimulated, it’s hard to deal with when the noise is overstimulated.”
Colorado has no clear guidelines for the new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old community college student and soccer player, is on trial in southeast Colorado for a crime that will soon be legal in this state: the possession of a few few marijuana cracks and a pipe with which he smoked them.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were on a September day in Lamar near the border with Kansas when they were stopped.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Orozco was charged with possession of drugs and drug utilities – knight crimes each with a <0x24>100 fine – and received a court date.
"We are being treated like criminals," said Orozco.
But is he also one?
In the uncertain weeks following the state’s decision to legalize small amounts of marijuana for own use, the answer to hundreds of minor drug offences depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of irregularities surrounding marijuana are already being dropped here and in the state of Washington, which has approved similar measures.
The police authorities are no longer prosecuting adults over the age of 21 for possession to a small extent, which will be permitted by law as soon as the new laws enter into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado have announced that they will continue to prosecute existing marijuana crimes and are still citing people in court.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the Western Mountains, are voting to prevent new state-licensed marijuana stores from opening in their communities.
“This situation is evolving so fast that I don’t know what’s going to happen next,” says Daniel J. Oates, chief of police at Aurora, east of Denver.
And even regulatory authorities in the state of Washington are scratching their heads recklessly.
They are awaiting guidance to set up a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug – and have a deadline until 1 December 2013.
In Washington, it is believed that Colorado is in the forefront of most states when it comes to regulating marijuana, where the drug was first legalized for medical purposes and then for own consumption.
"Colorado has a more heavily regulated market, so the state is well suited for guidance," said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Supervisory Authority for Spirits.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a rough guide.
"We don't have a real precedent that we can follow," he added.
The Washington Act, called I-502, comes into force on December 6th, forming the endpoint of a grey zone in which the state licensing system does not yet exist, but ownership is legalized.
And unpleasant practical issues need to be clarified at this time – such as how to agree on the state requirement for "appropriate access" to licensed marijuana with the ban on cannabis stores within 300 meters of schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities.
“Nowhere will it be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle bulging area,” said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the “Center for Legal Cannabis”, a recently formed research group.
On November 21, Chief Oates sent an e-mail to his employees in Aurora stating that the prosecutor would no longer pursue minor marijuana offences in persons over 21 years of age, and that the police would “should not immediately” pursue any criminal records for these crimes.
Chief Oates added that the police would continue to implement city regulations to regulate medical marijuana growers and drug dealers would continue to be tracked.
In Weld County in northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck represents a stricter view.
After the vote, he said his authority would continue to track marijuana ownership cases, mainly to move consumers to withdraw.
Currently, 119 people have to be held accountable for the possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana in court, although many have also been charged for other crimes.
"Our authority has a duty to prosecute violations at the time of the crime," Buck said in a statement.
The reactions are even biased in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer show adults for the possession of smaller amounts.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to drop all pending ownership proceedings.
“I don’t think I’m wasting my time enforcing the right until it changes,” he says.
Although 55% of voters in Colorado supported the measure, it was clear from the outset that it would not be easy to reconcile personal marijuana consumption with the complexities of government and the legal system.
And the contradictory reactions throughout the state promoted a deep divide among local officials in terms of the large green experiment to date.
District attorneys are a “cultural barrier,” says Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer representing prosecutors for marijuana crimes and acting on-site as a spokesman for the national marijuana law reform organization.
“They have spent so much of their lives prosecuting people for not being able to accept legalization,” he says.
The first countries to treat smaller amounts of marijuana such as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are traded as national pattern cases for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and state officials are preparing for an era of legal sales, they are also nervously waiting for instructions from the federal government, which wants to continue to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level as a crime.
Proponents of the legalization movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will surrender.
Despite several overwhelming arrests of consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the federal government has largely allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy adviser to the Obama administration, believes that while criminal officials are unlikely to enter the door to seize smaller amounts of the drugs, they are likely to rob themselves of legal, state-regulated marijuana regulations under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado are not waiting for the federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local municipal administrations approved moratoriums for new marijuana stores, although they could only open in about a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the west, decided a six-month ban, which is likely to be passed next week.
“We don’t want to get into a position where we license someone and then face a big problem at the federal level,” said Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our community has voted against this amendment.
We focus on what the community has chosen, not on what the state has chosen.
Many questions are still open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied from Oxford because I am Tory
Not only today’s university students are being attacked for their views
It has always been my biggest dream to get a place at the University of Oxford.
Both my father and my elder brother had visited that university, which I once thought was the greatest stamp of knowledge in the world, for a modern Greek symposium that fostered the great pillars of civilization – free thought and tolerance.
But within two weeks of my entry into Worscester College at the end of the 1980s – there I had planned to study history – I had packed my suitcase again and thus brought about the first scandal of my life.
My father broke into tears.
My friends were confused.
In the Evening Standard it was said that I would have gone because I had a problem with the fact that commilitons had sex in the neighboring room.
Author A N Wilson said shelmishly that I had left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less fun.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran, because I suffered systematic bullying and threats.
Not because of my very unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
I had been bullied for one reason only - one reason that seemed so tight and cruel in this alleged cradle of enlightenment: my late father Woodrow Wyatt was an important adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why am I mentioning this right now?
Well, according to current reports, a new generation of students of moderate rights suffer from similar persecution.
The organized and growing hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them last week demanded the same equality protection that benefits gays, disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of Corpus Christi College say they are “often actively isolated, personally attacked and declared undesirable” because of their political views.
They demand a seat on their college’s equality committee to ensure that their opinions can be freely expressed.
Their situation was aggravated by a recent documentary about political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which the Tories portrayed as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
This included graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the University of Oxford Conservative Student Association, who was riding a Rolls-Royce with a silver-coloured suit and silver-coloured walking stick.
In other universities, conservative students say they are regarded as "sin buckets for the introduction of higher tuition fees."
The 20-year-old Luke Black, vice president of the Conservative Students’ Association at the University of Nottingham, said in a Sunday newspaper: “There is a growing trend of links in universities.
“People think we’re like the Bullingdon Club without getting to know each other at all.”
Samuel Roberts, 21, and a history student in Corpus Christi, who initiated the search for greater protection, is of the opinion that such a climate is "unpleasant". 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, appointed president of the Conservative Student Association of Oxford, says against OBJ, she has raised a law at the JCR
“This poses a threat to the intellectual discourse and the well-being of the members,” she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old, I arrived in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
Last year, the University voted not to award an honorary title to Margaret Thatcher, a former student, due to cuts in college.
The atmosphere would have even frightened Stalinists.
In the first days of the first semester week, when new students get to know themselves and the tutors, I got a taste of the future events.
I made the experience that the tutors not only tolerated the ridicule of Tory students, but even participated with pleasure in it.
Political issues such as the miners’ strike, the privatization and the government’s refusal of sanctions against South Africa’s apartheid regime found their way into the wooded rooms of the tutorial.
At my first of these events, I was supposed to translate French texts from the 18th century into English. I had not been aware of what was to come then.
"Miss Wyatt," said tutor Harry Pitt (intermediately deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I stumbled on it.
Pitt was a little man with a face like cake, and quite hesitant.
"Do Thatcher followers refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students whispered.
There were tears in my eyes.
"I suggest that they take a couple of French lessons in your free time - so if you're not too busy with your social activities," Pitt whispered to me.
I went back to my room with my head hanging.
That evening, I was sitting alone at the college for dinner, when someone gently pointed me to my shoulder.
It was a second-year English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the Conservative Student Association.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it's what it is.
Anyone who is suspected to be Tory will be forced into action.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father's coming, Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be worse for you.
Most Tory first semesters pretend to be supporters of the Labour Party.
In a local pub, I later tried to move on.
I insisted that I was not in all points with Mrs Thatcher.
This trick should prove to be unsuccessful.
A beginner in the field of philosophy, politics and economics, who had ironically attended the conservative Eton College, said to me, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're dirty.
Other students shared their opinions.
I was perverted and dirty.
"How does Tories have sex?" one asked me.
They beat each other, don't they?
I felt as if homosexuals had to have felt before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever be able to live a normal life at the University of Oxford?
Would I be able to meet like-minded people only after the dawn of darkness?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years that stood before me spread before my spiritual eye into a spark of extinction and isolation.
The only tutor to openly identify as Tory was Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history who had his seat in my college.
He was hated not only for being a conservative, but also for advising Thatcher on foreign policy matters and writing speeches for them.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found it provincial and small-scale, and rejected it for his Marxist-deterministic history perspective.
In 1997 he took up a professorship at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
“You’re not going to be happy here,” he said.
I started wandering between Oxford and my parents’ house and found refuge with more open friends and family members in the city.
I told my father that I hated Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed unfaithful.
During his time in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said.
They would never do such a thing, not in my city of dreaming tower peaks.
Even my communist friends always put on a flawless day.
His wet eyes were blurred.
Give the whole thing a chance.
I'm sure you're just stuck.
It would break my heart if you went.
Tired of my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance was weakened.
One of my male friends, also a Tory fan, had succumbed to the pressure and denied his beliefs.
During a tutorial the following week, in which another storyteller seriously claimed that I was “an enemy of the people,” I decided to do the same.
Although I secretly broke off from shame, I admitted that my parents had undergone a “brainwash” and called her “old cunt.”
The relief only lasted for a short time.
It was my father who kicked the last nail in the bush of my Oxford career.
At that time he wrote two columns a week in the Murdoch press.
My door was closed.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes my rabbits gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
I'd love to have you call me a lazy slut.
But no 18-year-old should ever suffer from such intimidation and bullying in an educational institution.
And what’s even more tragic is that it was Oxford — a university that not only raised 14 Tory prime ministers, but still hides behind an undeserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to celebrity"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Master of Couture", which opened this week in London, ABC speaks to Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian fashion maker.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the UK capital that is worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
This has been recognized by the designer at the opening of "Valentino - Master of Couture", a grandiose retrospective for which more than 130 dresses of Haute Couture were assembled, created by his "house" in the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "Il Signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clients.
Valentino always felt a fascination for the sticky and distant world of the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, which will be visible until March 3, there are a variety of private letters and photos with the signature of the most read-only aristocracy, starting with Princess Salimah Aga Khan, from Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social ascension from the modest fashion maker in the town of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international jetset.
Being in love with the nobility doesn’t have to be a disadvantage.
"At least they don't show their tips on your lovely carpet, as some beautiful celebrities from pop music do," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We were all pleased to be invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, close friends with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of fame.
And yet he is a star.
Valeria Mazza in a Valentino dress
Also the Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the fashion maker.
Many years ago, after a fashion show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went home to him for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of his apartment, the decoration, the food and the music he recognized and felt his influence.
"Everybody felt important and loved," recalls the "Top Model", which began her career at the 1995 Haute Couture Week in Paris.
"He never comes out of fashion because his designs are works of art," she concludes.
Fashion show of origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of miscarriage, rather of mutual love.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious and 60-metre-long runway that proposes a roller exchange: the user takes the place of the model and walks along the runway to admire a dreamy "audience" with aryide, the "Kentóise" and the "Koradys", the masterpieces of the "Jack"
In this audience of fashion dolls, names such as Sibilla de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg shine.
Naty Abascal and the Modemaker, 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I can still remember perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a vest type "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn/winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's mice.
"I prefer him to everyone else because of his great love for women and because he emphasizes our beauty," the former Duchess of Feria added.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and emphasize the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Even the princess and fashion leader Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget the first time she wore a valentine.
When I was a teenager living in Italy, I dreamed of finally having the age and the opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
At the end of the 90s, it finally came about.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a party in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with a flying skirt and a draped top with a necklace that honors his name.
"It was a dream come true," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
“Valentino doesn’t depend on fashion, his obsession is timeless,” explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her fashion maker's evening dresses "with absolute care" "because a dress is not only a dress, but also the associated memories".
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition in Somerset House is the wedding dress by Marie-Chantal Miller for her wedding to Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (as the fashion designer called his girlfriends) were needed to make this ivory silk dress with pearls, twelve different embroidery and a four and a half meter long swing.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the top authority of the press, this dress was a milestone in Haute Couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the clients of the top society".
Confused with the elite's "savoir-être" for years, Valentino is now her best exemplary.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (Italy's highest award), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded with the Legion of Honor, garavani accumulates as many honors as each of his clients' husbands.
“I have always noticed his refinement, his tranquility, his caring and perfect exterior,” adds D’Arenberg.
I last saw him a month ago at a Gala Dinner at the Museum of Orsay.
He sat at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was flawless; time leaves no mark on him".
And that's what a princess says...
The most difficult profession in the world: the human working animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the bearers of the Indonesian volcano put their lives and health at risk when they carry 70 kilograms of sulfur over the steep, rocky paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others work literally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by collecting sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in eastern Indonesian island Java.
To do this, he has to climb down to the ground of his crater every day, where the sulphur-containing gas coming from the earth solidifies in contact with the air.
After breaking out large sulphur stones that can weigh up to 70 kilograms in total, he transports them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders over the slender paths of stone.
Although it is only 250 meters to the tip of the volcano, which rises up to an altitude of 2386 meters, the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes to climb at the turtle’s pace, maintaining the balance and not having to dislodge their steps carefully, so that they don’t have to break out and break out.
They know that every step can cost their lives, as happened to a French tourist who crashed on the cliffs of the Kawah Ijen years ago.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 euros for every kilo of sulfur they deplete.
Upstairs, they pave the way between the tourists who photograph them like circus trees and run with the tiresomely heavy baskets three kilometres to the scale that a mine company set a little further down at an altitude of 1850 meters
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, who since 1960 has been exploiting the volcano and (not to mention) its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 Eurocent) for each kilogram of sulfur.
That then sells them for 10,000 rupees (83 Eurocent) to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral is widely used in everyday life and is used for the manufacture of timber, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for the bleaching of sugar.
"Since we normally carry 70 kg, we get about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each route," explains Anto, who usually makes three routes a day.
For each route, it takes three hours to complete, but at the end of the day it has 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros).
What seems like a miserable wage for such a seemingly inhuman effort is three times what he would earn with field work.
"The daily salary of the miners here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euros), is very high," explains the carrier, who previously worked as a Maurer on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a nearby village, and for a reason that is as important in Indonesia as sulfur: "I married a girl from Bali, I married her to Islam, where they are Java, and they are Hindus."
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gas.
The 27-year-old Anto has been putting his life at risk at Kawah Ijen for three years, whose sulfur has already left the first traces of him, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated due to the toxic gas from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay for achieving his dream.
“I’m going to work here for another two years because I want to open a store or learn Spanish or French,” he promises in a more than just acceptable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent but life-punished young man could work as a tourist guide, waiter, or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he does the work of a bearer.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and stands up every morning at two o’clock because the sulphur also flows out at night, where its characteristic yellow color shines in the dark blue.
Challenging the shadows, he climbs into the crater in the light of a small headlamp on his helmet, which he bought from his own money.
Approximately 400 carriers load the baskets on their shoulders with sulfur on the crater floor.
Despite its large profits, the mining company has not mechanized the sulphur mining to save costs, and does not supply any equipment to the carriers who work on their own account and are paid by weight.
You will also not receive a share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) per camera, which the guardians of this nature park together with the entrance fee of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) demand from the tourists who come to photograph the volcano and the human body.
"This work is for the animals and not for humans," protests Madrusin, a stiff 42-year-old carrier who has been working for three decades since leaving school at Kawah Ijen.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assures that he continues "as long as it goes" because he needs the money to raise his three children aged between 10 and 18.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulphur burns the throat and the eyes sneeze when the wind suddenly turns and the miners cling to the thick columns that rise out of the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about serious diseases.
With the basket on his back, Unainik, aged 53, is only able to carry 50 kg.
Every day he and his companions break 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which is transported by three trucks over a goat trail between the beech to the camp in Tamansari at a distance of 18 kilometres.
“I’m not going to retire, I’m going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life,” Unainik explains, opening his mouth wide, with some teeth missing.
Of his five children, the eldest also works as a sulphur carrier at the age of 30.
Time passes, but poverty stops generation after generation in one of the hardest professions in the world: those who work as a human burden on the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore Needs Babys to Save the Economy
Singaporeans are blaming the fact that they don’t have children for their careers, the stress, and the cost of real estate and child education.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: let us fulfill our civic duty and create life!
It seems unbelievable that the verses are part of an advertisement for minz bonuses, but still – or just for that reason – they became a viral YouTube video in Singapore earlier this year.
The sentences are part of a rapper song, the local proverb such as "Slipping a "bao" into the oven to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
Advertising company BBH, which shot the video, realises the hope that the advert reaches in a funny way to draw attention to the problem.
Her creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfill their "national duty".
This is something just for the internet, so we had to make it funny and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
When it comes to planting, we are the worst in the world, so we noticed that this was a topic that we had to take care of.
We knew that the government had tried a lot, such as marketing perfumes with pheromones or organizing speed dating evenings (fast flirts).
It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought, why don't we do something as creative as possible to address this problem, like composing a rap?
1.2 Children
Those who do not take this issue lightly are the Government of Singapore.
She spends <0x24>1,300 a year on political action to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for couples and parents grants up to <0x24>15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But everything has so far had little success.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its rulers and its strict social controls.
According to its National Population Authority, the birth rate is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was above 2 – which is also known as the replacement rate – was in 1976.
So why don’t Singaporeans have children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy at the National Population Authority, said this was due to "better education" and "greater career opportunities".
“This has enabled people to have significantly more options in terms of life goals and priorities apart from getting married and forming a family,” she explains.
These changes in social circumstances have contributed to the increase in the number of single persons and the delays in marriage and childbirth, resulting in a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
In the meantime, an immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in immigration to counteract population declines has led to resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where the barely cashed xenophobia flourishes against many new immigrants, especially against the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the government party in Singapore achieved its worst election result since independence last year.
Since the elections, an attempt has been undertaken to correct the problem of higher contributions and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the declining birth rate has the known impact on a nation’s economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policy, Singapore’s example also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to achieve that not so many small apartments are being built.
This has already had an impact on the housing market.
The authority for urban development has started controlling the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes" and allowed to be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a great sales success.
However, there is concern that they can promote the lifestyle of the single person, and that they discourage construction companies from building large apartments for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of real estate firm EL Developers, says that its "shoe boxes" can be sold much faster than larger residential units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out by days and even weeks faster than the larger residential units.
This makes them much better for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new standards give developers clearer orientations, which were previously put in the way of obstacles if they wanted to build too many small residential units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for an increase in the national birth rate, the conversations with Singaporeans working in the financial district will not have a big impact.
“People are very stressed, the apartments and also education are expensive, which is why it is pushed out by many,” says a young manager.
Kids can get others.
“For me, it’s important to have my own money and time,” says another, about twenty-year-old man.
Men and women lead their careers, the stress and the cost of property and education as reasons they cannot have children.
That's why Singaporeans have the last word when it comes to having children - there's so much the government can do.

PRIVACY
According to the dictionary, this is the property of private or "the area of private life where one has the right to protection from any kind of interference".
What is private for someone under the age of 16?
How is this definition applied to his everyday life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers to which he is exposed if he makes known on the Internet situations he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five young people between the ages of 10 and 15 who are often on the net.
In four cases, they linked the term with “something very peculiar” on a personal level and “on the password and the user” when applying it to social networks.
“My deepest secrets I wouldn’t disclose in a post,” says 10-year-old Jorge in an attempt to explain the meaning of “private” in websites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
“These are very confidential secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world,” he said.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I also spend my time with friends.
“I wouldn’t share a photo that isn’t from me, or from someone who makes a fool,” he says.
The boy is clear that it is wrong to post obscene photos, of naked, of crimes, or to write offensive or violent comments.
Jorge assures to meet 35 friends he has in FB and nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are related.
Including the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I signed up for Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if anyone will answer me, I just charge them up," he adds.
“The social networks are entertaining, I can quickly talk to relatives in the distance or with friends,” he says.
Asked, he replied that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown person.
Even if someone recommends him a stranger, he would ignore this.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask he admits to not knowing 20 of the people he added to his friends list.
“That doesn’t scare me because we have something in common, like music,” he says.
According to the boy, no one has made statements to him or asked him for his address or phone number.
“If someone is pushing me or asking me to, I just remove it from my user account,” he admits.
José signed up with Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not unknown to experiences known today as cyberbullying.
A friend’s friend was bullied on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he said.
According to José, the victim did not close the user account.
"He just made it private."
After that, it explains a number of steps to securely configure a user account.
Unlike Jorge, this young man would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, I'd do that if he was unsympathetic to me or if I wanted to wipe him out.
"But I know this is cyberbullying," he explains.
Key Issues
Marielos Porras, an English teacher with a graduate degree in education and learning, believes that in order to orient children and young people, it must be understood that it is the purpose of social networks to inform.
“The Internet was created as a medium for searching for information; with the appearance of these pages, however, the rules of the game have changed,” she says.
Porras explains that the academic Marc Prensky, holder of a master's degree in pedagogy at Yale University and author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants" formed these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are the children and young people who have grown up with this technology.
“We are the digital immigrants who are supposed to teach them where we are still learning,” he says.
He explains that this is a complex topic, "because we require them to have a defined criterion about what can be disseminated, published or said, and this at an age where maturity is not enough for it."
“They should also be selective when it’s most important to be popular with them to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” he added.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents what privacy is is to ask them questions that bring them to thinking.
“To tell you not to do it doesn’t work,” he says.
Porras then mentions some ways: There are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger. Then why do you do it on the Internet?
Or: Would you like to post a photo of yourself like the one you posted by a friend?
Do you know what others are publishing about you?
Have you asked the other people for permission before when you labeled photos of celebrations?
And one more question: Do everyone have to know what you’re doing at any moment?
Another point is to give them an understanding that they need to trade online as they do it offline.
They are the same rules.
“Someone outside the Internet acts with respect, ethics, and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks,” he explains.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary school teacher and educational advisor, comments that it is essential that parents read the guidelines of social networks carefully.
When they understand all the sections, they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the importance of opening a user account on the Internet.
"For example, the age, or what to share or publish," he explains.
According to the Guardia, the children must be reminded of the lesson "You must not talk to strangers".
Conclusion of the Unasur Summit without publication of the Lima Declaration
The 6th summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, which was previously announced and should be theoretically signed by the seven rulers present.
Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the signed document at the VIth Ordinary Session of the Heads of State and Government of Unasur. Sources in the State and Presidential Chancellor's Office initially informed that they would hand it over after the clause, but after re-explaining it at some point on the web.
When asked about the text, they indicated that the content was presented to the press by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, in brief statements.
The access of journalists to information about the summit was limited at any time.
During the day, only the picture of the presidential meeting without a sound was transmitted in the press room with the message "private session, limited audio".
The little information circulated among the journalists was received from the press spokespersons of some of the Unasur governments present at the meeting, but not from the Peruvian press spokesperson.
The only document circulated during the day was the list of participating presidents, which caused discomfort among the hundreds of journalists from different national and international media who demanded more information.
Subsequently, the Peruvian presidential office sent an email to the media with the “declaration of conclusion” of the summit, but it was the declaration of Humala and not the official document for the conclusion of the summit.
Last October Peru hosted the 3rd Summit of South America-Arab States (ASPA), and even on this occasion, despite a press call, the so-called Lima Declaration, which had previously been announced, was also little published.
On the official website of the ASPA, you can be sure that the document was published on Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed that information systems for journalists would be available, but they greatly restricted access to information.
The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment by the Hague Court of Justice, which contributes to a border conflict between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would take the decision of the IGH, which begins Monday in The Hague, in the process of launching Lima against Santiago, to hear the pleamakers of both sides.
"We will follow and execute the judgement on the differences we are currently making in this international court," Humala said, along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has been, is and remains a country that adheres to international law, seeks peaceful solutions to disputes, concludes agreements and submits to international courts," Piñera added, greeting Humala with a hand-strengthening hand in front of the flags of both countries.
The confirmation by the two presidents that they would submit to the IGH came after Colombia, after a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it deemed to be a grave mistake, brought a lawsuit against the Bogotá Agreement, in which it agreed to the judgments of this International Court of Justice.
The presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, of Bolivia, Evo Morales, and of Argentina, Cristina Kirchner were present at the summit.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from Unasur since the resignation of its President Fernando Lugo since 2011, has not participated in the meeting.
Hosting President Ollanta Humala opened the talks in the morning and ended the summit shortly after lunch in Lima.
The head of state issued the final document, in which it announced that 16 decisions were made and the lines of action for 31 projects between South American countries were set at a total investment of <0x24>17 billion.
On the decisions taken, he said that the countries of Unasur "will take significant steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, to which we extend the decisions on the right of residence."
He noted that measures would be pushed forward to "improve cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and against organized, cross-country crime, as well as measures to improve access to drugs and the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America's economy and in the case of nature".
With the crisis in Europe, "economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not take triumphant trains, but should serve to expand our production performance and show our peoples a better future," Humala added.
“We have decided to give priority to a number of 31 emblematic projects aimed at improving spatial connections in South America and especially in rural and border areas ... and thus unite our countries and open up new forms of economy,” the Peruvian president said in a statement.
Among these projects are five Peruvian, located on the axis of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and two of which are intended to ensure a better connection with Ecuador, although it did not provide further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country serves for its re-admission into the Union of South American nations," from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to continue to remain an integrated region of prosperity and peace and with good neighbourly relations was another aspect highlighted at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before attending the regional meeting in Mexico on Saturday that he expected a meeting with his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, to respect the maritime conflict following a judgment of the IGH in Bogotá.
"Maybe I'll meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow," Santos said.
"We will review all these ways - they are not exclusive, and the agreement with Nicaragua also makes talks with Nicaragua necessary," he said.
"I hope to be able to say to President Ortega that we will treat this matter as civilized and respectfully as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intend to be present at the new president of the country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the summit, the Defence Ministers of the bloc also met in advance to adopt the Action Plan for 2013, which aims to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, although the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru has the presidency at the time of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn how to integrate citizens," says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal, with "South America really can learn something from Europe."
Correa, who participated in the 6th summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Lima, told state television in Peru that Europeans "behaved in World War II and other conflicts" and "are practically a fatherland today."
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship that drives the member states of Unasur.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries must be achieved, as is already the case in the Andean community; however, there are still reactionary sectors that seek a return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also advocated the redesign of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the prerequisite to reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and to take into account those who have signed the San José Convention on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit to anything, and in return, we South Americans always sign everything.
"It's incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is based in Washington and is funded by the United States," he said, citing the political asylum Ecuador granted to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles but adhered to his "deep democratic values and views on human rights".
He added that at the time, there were “reasonable assumptions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his procedure would not be followed.”
He also criticized the Swedish judiciary, which had asked him to interrogate him on his territory for an alleged sexual offence, while "Swedish jurisprudence allows this through a video conference that could have been carried out via the Ecuadors embassy in London."
Correa explained that there was a risk that Assange's health and mental condition would be affected.
“Since he is in our embassy, I haven’t spoken to him, but the ambassador has informed me that he has a mild lung problem, but not a serious one,” he said.
However, there is a risk that he will take physical and mental damage because he is trapped in a narrow space and cannot perform physical exercises outdoors.
"This would affect everyone's health," he added.
Correa stated that the solution for the asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadors Embassy in London was the granting of a free wiki with which he could travel to Ecuador, and that this has been in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the legal authorities have found a solution to talk to the London authorities about the situation of Europe.
We do not act on human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there have been constant conversations.
“The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European legal authorities because Assange’s lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, is conducting a series of proceedings on various European instances,” he said.
And "if the UK grants this free letter tomorrow, I think it's done."
And if Sweden interrogated Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London or via Skype, how the Swedish jurisprudence was allowed and was done in other cases, the problem was solved.
Correa took the opportunity to affirm himself as a defender of press freedom, saying that what he does not tolerate is "the mediocrity, the evil intention, and the lie that discourage free speech."
“The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not the evil and perverse politicians, but the bad journalists who are striving for profit and oppression,” he said.
In this sense, he congratulated himself that Ecuador would no longer be "dominated by such journalists, nor by the bankers or hegemonic and oppressive countries," and predicted that in a re-election, he would "deep up the revolution to continue the path in this right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in Unasur at least until his next election, arguing that the body "must remain tough and must not give up on opportunism and no legally disguised coup d'état" because "the legitimacy of Paraguay" was thus "degraded."
The President of Ecuador also considers the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which favored the maritime statehood of Nicaragua, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime law borders between the two countries, "absolutely regrets."
At present, this judgment is not enforced.
It is a problem between a South and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They need to be treated extensively so that you can overcome them and look forward.
Similarly, he relied on a good conclusion of the dispute over the maritime borders between Peru and Chile before the same court, stating that "it is right for Latin America to appeal to international instances if both countries undertake to accept the verdict, even if it falls very hard."
Regarding the possibility that he would run for the next presidential election in Ecuador to reach his third consecutive term, he said he saw this opportunity "with a lot of optimism and joy, although sometimes it's also very difficult."
Correa assured that if he lost the election in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
I have never personally been interested in power, but under such unfair circumstances as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
“My political movement had the belief that I was the one who guaranteed this likely victory, so I have to fulfill that responsibility,” he said.
If I should win, it would be my last term as president, after which I will retire from public life.
This also applies if we lose.
"This is decided," he explained.
Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I just spoke with the Vice-President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, who told me that he had traveled there for a planned routine treatment and that he would expect to be able to travel back to Cuba after the election campaign.
“It does not in any case mean a relapse in President Chávez’s health,” he said.
The Ecuadorian Head of State took part today in Lima at the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with a call for higher regional integration to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
Cause of death due to AIDS is too late to be detected today
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed to be HIV-positive.
"It was like a bomb hit," he says of the moment he received the diagnosis, which the doctor tried to weaken without noticeable success.
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness on his own and began to learn about it; and this with such a commitment that he was just celebrating his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), to which he came after several battles in 1994.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was hard to imagine in the early 1990s when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmas.
At the time, the director of an IMSS clinic himself avoided saying goodbye, "because it led to a sack."
At the time, AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is also possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the clinic who do not know anything about their disease and in which the virus has already done damage and exhausted their immune system, and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the occurrence of the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who is taking the treatment in time is information, and the survival of the general population is exactly the same.He said that in April this year, in this case, the leader of the HIV group said.
The specialist for infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, the scientists concluded that although AIDS is not a death sentence, that the years of survival and the quality of life of the CD are not up to 200th from the degree of impairment of the CD4, the age of the drug is 50th from the age of a person, and the age of the immune system is up to the age of a person.
Simply put, the above explanations mean that if a person is diagnosed with HIV at the age of 25, in this sense, "it can be 75 years old without any problems as long as he is under control," said the expert.
In order to properly rank this progress, it must be remembered that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Even though death rates have decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people who die from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is still correct that since the publication of the ProSID data, the number of people who die from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011).
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and by May this year there are already 187 deaths; however, universal access to antiretroviral medicines has been assured since 2005.
- So why are people still dying?
- In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years we have had no supply problems with the drugs. The problem is that people come in a far advanced state because they do not know their condition of infection, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "Nine in ten patients come to us if they already have an accompanying infection. In order to be able to affect global mortality, early diagnosis is required, therefore, all people who need this must be given massive detection tests."
This proposal is agreed by the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención de Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee on AIDS Prevention in Jalisco) and also by patients like Fabrizio, who has made his test in a private laboratory, and this has been the only reason why it has been made in a private laboratory.
Everything is different when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they’re going to die and don’t want to hear anything.
"If I have to die, then I'd rather bleed three times," you say in my case.
The change was to improve, I nourish myself well, exercise and take the medications.
Today, all his parents know is that he has cancer.
I live a normal life, just like everyone else.
"I work, I do a lot of business, I have an active but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and that of the other person," adds Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO in order to animate with his testimony those who have experienced this today.
You should take the test if you belong to the risk group. The earlier you know if you are HIV-positive, the better, and if you already know the diagnosis, you should learn how to live responsibly for all people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the loading table
There are huge gaps between health programs and the simple citizen, explains Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has taken on the issue of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In the places designated for this, "the distribution of condoms was actually increased; they were previously given individually, now they give us packets with a hundred pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
Young people are at risk for new infections.
"Why do you need it?" is a common joke by social workers, guidance staff in schools, staff in pharmacies and in the health system that young people do not want to be exposed to, the correspondent said.
He proposed to reorient this inefficient distribution; the condoms should be located not only behind the loading table, but in outlets in public toilets of facilities often visited by young people.
There is no need to promote promiscuity.
They should not be paid the beer and the motel, as Governor Emilio González answered the question of whether conservatives would be distributed under his administration.
“Sexuality doesn’t look like that; it’s best to bring the condoms closer to those who already have a sexual activity,” he said.
Key data from Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
Nationally, the state ranks 4th in new and cumulative AIDS cases, and 13th in HIV cases.
92% of infections occur through sexual intercourse, 6% through blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because for each registered case there are 4 or 5 people who do not know it.
After the Court of Appeal of the United States has confirmed a judgment that does not recognise the restructuring of the liabilities of the Vitro Group achieved through a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico, an incurable precedent for any national company with offices in the neighbouring country has created the problem of payment.
Thus, it could be said that the procedures for the survival of the companies that allow Mexican laws have no validity in the country of stars and stripes, contrary to international agreements.
In practice, the recognition of Judge Harlin Hale’s judgment received on June 15 at the Bancarrotas Court for the Northern District of Texas causes Mexican companies to be helplessly exposed to the seizure of their property beyond the Bravo River.
However, the decision opens doors and doors to the largest glass producer in Mexico to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court for three inconsistencies.
While the judge of the case pointed out that creditors must be subject to U.S. bankruptcy law, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal, based in New Orleans, says at first that the main proceedings are dealing with trade bankruptcy in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in insolvency proceedings is not known to companies with a cross-country profile.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations Model Law was created for the unification of international trade law, using the American Law Institute as a simpler.
Secondly, the judgment determines that without the votes of the companies, after recognition of the bankruptcy mass liabilities that the subsidiaries of Vitro and their parent company had had, the majority required for the restructuring of the liabilities would not have been achieved.
However, this possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case where this scheme has been approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Commercial Mexicana, whose liabilities among the group’s companies have been confirmed by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles.
It is also correct that, after deducting the votes of the branches, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who complained against Vitro in the courts of the United States, i.e. the geier funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool did not.
The vote would have been 45 per cent against 37 per cent.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro is to blame for his difficult situation from 2008 in the context of the major economic crisis in the United States that struck the country.
For this reason, the González Sada family objected before the same appellate court to the Plenary voting, i.e. by all judges, because only three of them voted.
If this is not done, the Cerciorare appeal, which requires the review of the proceedings by a higher court, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States, shall be lodged.
The serious thing in this case is that the court dismissed a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the figure amicus curiae (Friend of the Court) in which the procedure carried out by Vitro was described in the context of the law on commercial bankruptcies, and in which it was pointed out that the amendment is noted by the 15th set.
It is also pointed out that the country has been subject to the principles of the United Nations Commission for International Trade, i.e. the established rules for cases of cross-border insolvency that guarantee the equalisation of debtors and creditors.
Two-band caramboles: a blow for Vitro and for the country.
General Balance Sheet
After the announcements by the Mexican air traffic unions against former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraud, had not been made public for several months, the Asociación Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores (Associación Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores) has ended Fort Pilots.
The lawsuit filed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has now filed a criminal proceedings against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is being filed for obstruction of justice.
Subsequently, the Supervisory Authority has systematically refused to inform the General Administration of the Republic of a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur in order to deduct 198 million pesos from the trust account F/589 of the Bank IXE in the name of Mexicana de Aviación.
This appropriation was used for the acquisition of shares of the Administradora Profesional de Hoteles (professional hotel management).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Dragon Mart is encircled
At a weekend meeting at a forum of the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of civil society decided to create a broad front to resist the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country beyond the wall, supplemented by a residential area for the employees of 150 companies.
In advance, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Manufacturing) has reached a unification of the governors in the southeast to oppose the monumental establishment that destroyed partly protected areas and represents the mother of all the threats of industry.
Acta is dead.
Because the government has failed to comply with a request by the Senate to explain the conditions under which the Mexican ambassadors in Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known under the English abbreviation ACTA, the matter has been resolved according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures took place, although the Senate had ruled out the possibility because it viewed them as a violation of free speech on social networks.
Homex Long-Term
In an effort to pay long-term liabilities without affecting short-term liabilities, the construction company Homex is launching stock certificates of over 500 million pesos.

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
Basketball’s world-bomber, Héctor “Hetin” Reyes, has been involved in basketball for more than 60 years and has traveled the world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a great spiritual collection of the country's basketball history as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before being tied to the wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, Rexes was part of this sport for 6 years, whether as a lower-class player, first national league player, BSN representative and leader with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of the Basketball Association.
"All my life I've worn many hats in basketball, even several at the same time, when I was president of the BSN, chief executive of the national team and president of the association in the 1990s," Reyes recalled when visiting Primera Hora at his home.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes is not exaggerating with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and testify to them.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are those of his time at the Vaqueros from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, where he celebrated his 15th anniversary as the club’s co-director or CEO.
“These were the best years I’ve enjoyed most because I’ve been part of eight vaqueros championships since 1967 whether it was as a CEO, co-director or coach.
It was many successful years, including the five consecutive championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to a championship in 1981, the year of Jerome Mincy’s debut at BSN.
From then on, Cuco took over Ortiz, who was a very good manager,” Reyes says.
I still remember that Gene Bartow, who worked here as a coach and was employed at the University of Alabama, Birmingham, said: "I have a very strong and 2-metre-long player.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended the free throw specialist Raymond Gausse, who was a citizen and was one of our best throwers.
I still remember how he said that if Mincy had enabled a championship for Bayamon, Gausse would provide another.
The Vaqueros championship with Gausse was granted to him, but from a distance, because he was already in the top position of the association in 1988.
At that time, he preferred to enjoy his performances and that of Mincy in the national team.
I remember the first time we won the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico against the United States.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we took fourth place, what should have been bronze if it wasn’t for that Canadian referee who had made us repeat the last round for the second time,” Reyes said.
Was this 1990 World Cup team the best national team you’ve ever seen?
She is one of the best, as well as those who won the 2004 Olympics against the Dream Team.
But my favorite is the team at the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, where we won gold and offered the US team a fight, as they did when they won bronze against us at the World Championships.
Not only did Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who were not involved in the 1990s due to an injury.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and which gave us great joy was that of the 1995 Pre-Olympic Tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a substitute for the blocked players due to the events at the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against every forecast.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
This was without a doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His figures at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated this level as much as Piculín.
And this without taking into account his career in the different leagues in which he has played.
Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico?
That's a difficult question.
We had a number of good coaches like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I love the work of Leo Arill.
What do you think is the best thing you have achieved in the association?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN in the early 1990s up to 17 teams in a season.
What else do you have to do?
There are things that I would have introduced, such as the regionalization of the lower categories.
For example, the boys in Ponce only play in their territory and only meet teams from other corners of the island in the national playoffs.
Today, children do unnecessary many trips and games.
At least I see the result of the prescribed trainings and courses for trainers, table officials and referees.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like to listen to music, watch videos of music of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and from time to time I go to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who has always been at my side.
Larry Hagman is dead
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth, Texas, and became world famous for his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series "Dallas", where he played a scrupulous, homeless and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnet J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of the lust of the 1980s, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new Dallas season, died Friday afternoon from cancer complications, according to a family press release to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of Dallas.
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role he liked most," the family said.
Larry’s family and closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving celebrations.
Linda Gray, who played his wife's role in the original and sequel series, was with Hagman when he died at the Dallas hospital, her publisher Jeffrey Lane said.
He made everyone happy who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived life in full swing," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he admitted that he had drunk a lot over the years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was detected in his liver, and he underwent a transplant.
In the years before "Dallas" Hagman was known on television as a nice guy from 1965 to 1970 with the sitcom "Enchanting Jeannie" by NBC.
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is put on his head when he meets an attractive "dschinn" (played by Barbara Eden), who will live at his home.
He was also an actor of two short-lived comedies, such as The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His film works included critically acclaimed roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the charmingly disgusting J.R. that made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series of the CBS television chain about the Ewing clan and other figures in its surroundings was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advert “Who Shot J.R.?”, which was supposed to create expectations for an episode full of emotions where Hagmann’s character was nearly killed, led to international speculation, and millions of dollars were wagered in casinos.
The series reached a spectator record at the time.
When the answer was announced in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million viewers, transforming "Dallas" into the second most viewed entertainment program since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Kristin who shot J.R.'s sweeper (interpreted by Mary Crosby).
J.R. had swayed her and threatened to portray her as a prostitute if she did not leave the city, but others had reasons to want to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of the Ewing as a corrupt, insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a reckless businessman and disloyal husband who sought to show off his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what to stand on J.R.'s gravestone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should be called "Here rests the Honourable Citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only deal he didn’t win.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as "a huge personality on and off the screen".
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of worshippers around the world and remains to us who have been fortunate to know and love him in our hearts.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were aired a few months ago with great success on the TNT television channel.
The recording of five chapters for the second season was completed, and a sixth chapter was just shot, the broadcaster informed.
There was no immediate explanation from Warner or TNT as to how Hagmann's loss would be handled in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she got Larry during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the theaters in New York in the early 1950s, then served in the British Air Force from 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities have their residence.
In 2001, he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
“I didn’t write anything that I thought could harm someone or harm him in any way,” the Associated Press said.
After the liver transplant, he volunteered for liver donations and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist anxiety patients.
"I advise them, give them courage, I will meet with them when their operations are to come and after," he said in 1996.
I would like to give them some comfort, such as "don't worry, it's a little uncomfortable the first time, but you'll be fine."
He also opposed smoking and took part in several campaigns.
Beginning of the course that studies the "End of the World"
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
Each semester, when the professor of religion decided to take a course about the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible angel hook: the end of the "long countdown" of the Mayan calendar on December 21, which many people believed it meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect in the next two months: the destructive Hurricane Sandy, which some have called "Deudar Armageddon", as well as a growing conflict involving Israel, the place from which Christian theorists believe the apocalypse begins.
“I didn’t notice this will be the most apocalyptic semester ever,” Charmé told students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey this week.
If someone analyzes what happened in the world today, as if we were 30 days away from it, this would be a really good period.
And he reminds us that evil is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he’s not the only professor to offer courses on “the end of the world” this semester, which should actually be the last in history.
In Temple, visiting Professor Barry Vacker gives the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
“We’re analyzing why these ideas spread over time,” he said, as well as the way hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a particular human behavior.
If nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, the students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and examined how they were compared to real life.
"I have tried to inform the students about what is possible, likely, credible and impossible," said Becker.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Professor of Latin American History Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, a visiting Professor of Art History and Anthropology, have formed a team to offer a course entitled “The End of the World.”
“We’re not recording 2012, so we always keep the option of being able to stop the course again in case the world isn’t going down,” Restall said.
Despite the "imminent downfall", students must study, create projects and take part in final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam is conducted on the eve of the apocalypse, which is why the students have no other chance than "to work until the night where the world is supposed to end," Restall said.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours, there were no more places," Restall said of his course for high-average students who filled themselves with 35 students.
For weeks before the start of the semester, we received emails from students asking if there were any more vacancies.
The students, in turn, ensure that the course is among the most interesting.
“It’s fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves,” said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student at Rutgers Camden for Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sect or religious mentality is simply a matter of comfort or lack thereof.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student for psychology and nursing, says he has seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of a lesson where this is taught," he said.
I'm enjoying it.
But none of the students surveyed — and less of a professor — stated to believe in the last date of December 21.
“Our first project addressed the prophecies of the Maya, and in a certain way we discredit them,” said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old student in Temple, West Chester, last year.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it is just a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
He notes, however, that there is an apocalyptic fear in Western society that dates back several centuries when people responded to changes in their environment with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculations.
“Somewhere else people don’t think that way,” he says.
This is mainly the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who teaches in the Philippines this year, quickly answers the question of whether he would know a course there about the "End of the World."
"The Philippines are not participating in the end of the world," he wrote as an indication of an exception to a higher instance.
We have a mercy from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years many days were talked about by the last court, and said that if nothing happens on December 21st, "people immediately think of a new date" or philosophized that December 21st is the beginning of a seven-year period after the end of the world.
Students and teachers take this date lightly.
Several said they wanted to go to celebrations about “the end of the world.”
“Maybe I’m calling a few friends so we can laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communication student.
