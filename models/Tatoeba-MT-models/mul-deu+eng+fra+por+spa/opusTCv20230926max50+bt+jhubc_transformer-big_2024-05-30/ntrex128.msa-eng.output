A member of the Council of Wales (AM) is concerned about "looking like a doll"
There are concerns within a few AMs over the proposal their title should be changed to MWP (Members of the Parliament of Wales).
It came as a result of a plan to change the name of the trial to the Welsh Parliament.
The entire political spectrum is concerned that it could invite the spectrum.
An AM from the Labour Party said that the party took care of ‘he gave up with ‘Twp’ and ‘Pwp’.
For readers outside of Wales: In Wales, ‘twp’ means ‘crazy’ and ‘pwp’ means ‘clean’.
AM of Plaid said the party as a whole was "unhappy" and had proposed alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said his party was ‘open-minded’ about the name change, but stated it was a short oral jump from the MWP to the Doll.
In this context, the letter ‘w’ in the Welsh language is referred to the English term Yorkshire for the letter ‘u’.
The Commission of the Council, which is drafting the law to introduce the name change, said: "The final decision on any deputy who is called a Member of the Council must be a matter for the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act 2017 authorizes the Welsh legislature to change its name.
In June, the Commission announced the results of public negotiations on a proposal that received widespread support to call the assembly as the Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the title AM, the Commission is favored by Wales Parliament members or WMP, but the MWP option receives the most support in public negotiations.
AM seems to suggest alternative options, but it is problematic to reach a word of agreement and could detract from the head of Honorary Officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a bill on the changes within a few weeks.
Laws on renewal include other changes in the manner in which the meeting works, including rules on the loss of AM eligibility and the design of the committee system.
AM will get the final vote on what to say when they discuss the law.
Macedonia votes in referendum to change country name
Voters will either vote on Sunday to change their country's name to the "North Republic of Macedonia."
The popular vote was set up in an effort to settle a dispute over decades with neighboring Greece, which has its own territory called Macedonia.
Athens has long asserted that its northern neighbor's name represents claims against its territory and has repeatedly denied its bid for membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposed the vote on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that the name change is only the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO unity.
St. Martin's Loceng Silent Because Churches Are Ruining in Harlem
"The elders I met said, according to history, there are bars and churches in every corner of the street," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, both of them are gone."
He said the loss of the bar was understandable.
"A lot of people are socializing in a different way now," he said.
"The bar is no longer a living room in the neighborhood where people will always go."
For the church, he was concerned that money from the sale of assets would not last as long as the leaders expected it, "and slowly they would return where they began."
Churches, he said, could be replaced by apartment buildings and condominiums inhabited by people who do not want to help maintain the sacred places that are still in this neighborhood.
"Most of the people who will buy condominiums in this building are white people," he said, "and therefore will make these churches closed at all because it is unlikely that most people who enter this condominium will be members of the churches."
The two churches were built by white groups before Harlem became a black metropolis - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The Methodist Church moved in the 1930s.
The nearby Black Church has taken ownership of the building.
St. Martin has been taken over by black gangs under the Honourable John Howard Johnson, who led a trader boycott on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, who opposed taking or promoting black gangs in work.
The fire in 1939 caused the building to be severely damaged, but as Pastor Pastor, Johnson made plans to rebuild, they ordered tower bells.
David Johnson, the son and successor of the Johnson Pottery in St. Martin, proudly called the tower's bell a 'poor people's lodge.'
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: “Cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument.”
Expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also stated that it was the world's first bell to be played by black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger bell at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin did not replace him.
What has been played in St Martin over the past few months has become a complexity for architects and contractors, some people brought by church leaders, others by the bishops.
The Vestri room - the church's administrative body, consisting of public leaders - wrote the bishop in July with concern the bishop "will try to approve the cost" of the vestry room, although the vestry room was not involved in the takeover of architects and contractors brought in by the bishop.
Some members of the church complain about the lack of transparency in the part of the bishop.
A 13-year-old boy was injured while diving in California in search of a coral reef.
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was diving looking for coral reefs in California on the opening day of the coral reef season, officials said.
The attack took place before 7 a.m. near the Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego he was diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then riding along with a group of people to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said at first he thought it was just a fun scream to catch a coral reef, but he "recognized that the boy was screaming, "I have to bite!
I have to bite!"
The whole bone of the skull has been fractured and opened," Hammel said he noticed when he got the slave.
"I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a bucket in the water!'" Hammel added.
The child was taken to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was listed in critical condition.
The species of sharks responsible for the attack is unknown.
Rescue captain Larry Giles told media outlets that shrimp had been found in the area a few weeks ago, but it has been confirmed to be a harmless species of shrimp.
Giles added the victim suffered a traumatic injury to the top of his body.
Officials closed off coastal access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security purposes.
Giles says there are more than 135 species of shrimp in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plan to enter the beauty market in the UK
Sainsbury takes Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams from a beauty style room in a serbaneka building controlled by an expert waitress.
As part of the hard work entering the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market in the UK, which continues to thrive while fashion sales and home appliances are back, a larger beauty space will be tested in 11 buildings across the country and taken to more buildings next year if it yields success.
Investing in beauty emerges when the market is looking for ways to use the previously charged shelf space for TV, microwave ovens and home appliances.
Sainsbury said it would double the size of its beauty offering to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The range of products available from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space with parts of the same brand as those found in stores such as Boots.
The wholesale market is also re-launching a variety of Boutique retail products to make the majority of its vegan-friendly products - something that is becoming more and more in demand by buyers than young people.
In addition, fragrance store Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two major markets in Sainsbury, the first opened in Croydon, south of London, last week while the second opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, late this year.
Purchasing online and switching towards buying a little food every day at local grocery stores means the market needs to work hard again to convince people to come.
Mike Coupe, Sainsbury's chief executive, said the branch would look like a serbaneka building as the high-market chain tries to counter Aldi and Lidl's big business with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury has placed the Argos branch in hundreds of stores and has also introduced several locations since it bought both chains two years ago, said to have increased retail sales and made profits more profitable.
The wholesale market previously wanted to change the beauty and pharmacy parts that ended in failure.
Sainsbury tested the same venture as Boot in early 2000, but the partnership ended after a dispute over how to divide the revenue from pharmacy stores in its major market.
The new strategy emerged after Sainsbury sold 281 pharmaceutical store businesses to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million, three years ago.
He said Lloyds played a role in the plan, adding various luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy within the four buildings.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury, said: "We have changed the appearance and appearance of our beauty room to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invest with specially trained friends to be willing to offer advice.
Our diverse brands are designed to meet every need, and an attractive environment and convenient location means that we are now an attractive beauty destination that challenges old-fashioned shopping."
Peter Jones 'shoots' after Holly Willoughby withdraws <0xC2><0xA3>11 million
Peter Jones, the Dragons' Den star, has been 'cracked' after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand business to focus on his new contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for home items and accessories from the Truly Brand.
The couple's business was coined by the Goop brand by Gwyneth Paltrow.
A 37-year-old woman used Instagram to announce that she was going to stop.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' Den star, Peter Jones, in an angry state by withdrawing from the lucrative lifestyle brand business in the last moments - to focus on her extraordinary new contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was "striking" when the successful TV woman admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at her business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new offer - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - meant she had no time to devote homeware and accessories from the Truly brand.
The business has been paired with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby's worth of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, uses Instagram to announce he is leaving True, Jones flew out of Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source said: "So far, it's really been Holly's priority.
It will be his long-term future that will be able to see him in the next few decades.
The decision to pull out all the people involved was really surprising.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, it's so close to the launch.
There's a warehouse full of stuff in Marlow's office that's ready for sale."
Experts believe the release of This Morning delivery, which is among the most acceptable stars in the bank in Britain, could cost firms millions due to large investments in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothes and household goods, and potentially to delay its launch.
It can be the end of that friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children and husband Dan Baldwin have been friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truely with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined him as chairman in March.
The couple are on vacation together and Jones has 40% stake in Baldwin, a TV publishing firm.
Willoughby will be a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as an ITV lawyer in the I'm A Celebrity' program.
A source close to Jones said last night "We will not comment on his business affairs."
"We're in love and then we're in love"
He was joking about criticism that would be received by the news media for making reviews that would be partly considered "unnatural to the president" and very positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up too much?
Trump said by appointing a voice of “news readers.”
"I never gave up losing."
He said Kim was interested in the second meeting after their initial meeting in Singapore in June had been designated by Trump as a major step towards the end of North Korea's nuclear program.
But the negotiations for the end of the nuclear program were well-established.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea saw no "similar response" from the United States to the early North Korean truce.
On the contrary, he said, the U.S. continues the restrictions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a more optimistic view in his assembly speech.
"We have a good relationship with North Korea," he said.
"We are going to fight with North Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had made a positive decision - to end the missile test, help release the ransom, and bring home the corpses of the former U.S. military.
And he maintained his remarkable approach in talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this dense arena, we're going to have about 200 people standing there," Trump said.
Indonesia Tsunami and Earthquake Destroy Islands, Killing Hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organizations said they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok have been displaced, no national disasters have been declared, as a condition to secure international aid.
"In many situations, unfortunately, they clearly didn't ask for international help, so it's a bit challenging," said Ms. Subung.
While Save the Children together in a team goes to Palu, it's uncertain whether foreign staff can work at the scene.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid effort.
Based on the earthquakes that Indonesia often faces, the country remains unprepared to face natural disasters.
Although a tsunami shelter has been built in Aceh, it is not a common sight on other coasts.
The lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, although the warning has become powerful, is like contributing to the loss of life.
At the best time, travelling between islands in Indonesia is certainly challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics more complicated.
A hospital ship placed in Lombok to care for the earthquake victims was heading to Palu, but it took at least three days to get to the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo has made severe infrastructure improvements a key factor in his election campaign, and he has given high allocations to highways and railroads.
But the lack of funds has affected Jokowi's administration because he is facing re-election next year.
Jokowi faces pressure from mashab tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have accepted a more conservative understanding of religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced from their homes because Christian and Muslim groups fought in the streets, using arrows, arrows, and other weapons.
View: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge matches his position against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League by scoring one goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a message from Xherdan Shaqiri when about 30 ela from Chelsea's goal with his team ahead 1-0.
He kicked the ball to the left before pushing towards a distant net of goals.
The experiment swelled high above the goal goal as it floated towards the top right corner of the net.
Finally the ball fell over Arrizabalaga that jumped and fell into the net.
"He's just trying to get into that position, to get the ball and players like Shaq always carry the ball as far as possible, so I'm trying to slow down as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and make a pair and didn't think long and hit on."
Chelsea ahead 1-0 in a half-time round after gaining a net in the 25th minute from Belgium star Eden Hazard.
The Blues forward sent the ball back to Mateo Kovacic in the game, before leaking in the middle of the field and running into the middle of Liverpool.
Kovacic gives and sends can quickly in the middle.
He then released a beautiful kick, bringing Hazard into the goal goal goal.
Danger crossed the defense and scoring away goals with a left foot kick over Liverpool player Alisson Becke.

Indonesia Tsunami death toll rises to 832
The number of deaths from earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia increased to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday morning.
Many people are reportedly trapped under the collapse of a roughly 7.5-magnitude earthquake that struck Friday and triggered a 20-foot-high wave, a spokesman for the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
Palu Airport, which has more than 380,000 people, is filled with fragments of the collapsed building.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man for allegedly murdering a woman who was tortured to death.
The murder investigation was conducted after the woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. at Grayson Mews on John Street, with a 32-year-old man arrested for murder.
Police have urged the people in the area to see or hear anything to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still at an early stage but I urge anyone around John Street in Birkenhead to see or hear something suspicious to contact us.
I also urge anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the front-facing camera footage to contact us because they may have important information for our investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed the woman whose body was found was a local Birkenhead citizen and she was found inside her house.
In the evening, friends who believed they knew the woman had arrived at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Police said an investigation was underway, they were in the process of informing the victim's heirs.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to enter his apartment but was told by police that no one was allowed to enter or exit the building.
He'd become a fool when he found out what was going on.
People were told the investigation took hours until they were allowed back in.
A police officer told a man that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the scene in a condition of crying.
He repeated, "It's so terrible."
At 2 p.m., two police vans were inside the cordon and another van outside.
Some officers were standing in the cordon monitoring the blocks of the apartment shares.
Anyone with information is asked to send a message directly to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers in advance at 0800 555 111 citing log 247 from 30 September.
Cromwell Parliament's statue is the latest reminder of the "history of rewriting"
Its removal would be poetic justice for annihilation like the Taliban with so many of England's artifact cultures and religions carried out by its fanatic Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society describes Mr. Crick’s suggestion as ‘stupid’ and ‘try to rewrite history.’
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It is inevitable in today's debate about the removal of statues to which Oliver Cromwell's figure outside Westminster Palace will be the target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil War was either not directed or run by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of Thomas's forefathers in the last century.
The beautiful representative Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft against Cromwell is evidence of the 19th century and part of the history that many believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was regarded by many, more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a parliamentary defender against external pressure, in his situation of course a monarchy.
Whether it is a full representation is the subject of continuous historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid-17th century conflict has shaped the development of our country's next, and Cromwell is an individual known as the figures representing one part divided.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth mentioning and remembered."
Pigs kill Chinese farmers to death
A farmer was attacked and killed by pigs in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, known by his surname "Yuan," was found dead with a broken artery, filled with blood near a market in Liupanshui in the Guizhou region, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer was preparing to inject the vaccine into the pig on May 30, 2005 in Xining Qinghai Province, China.
He was reportedly travelling with his cousin from the Yunnan region on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next day, his cousin finds him dead, and finds a pork door next door open.
He said in a pig cage was a large male pig with a bloody mouth.
Forensic examinations confirmed that 550 pounds of pork had strangled farmers to death, according to the report.
"his family" Wu, "said, as quoted by the News of the Evening Guiyang.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the store at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed his pig.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Night News that the pig had been locked up to prevent it from attacking others, while the police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rarely occurring, cases of pig attacks on humans have been reported before.
In 2016, pigs attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with critical injuries.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig embedded a Welsh farmer into his tractor so his wife drove the animal away.
After Oregon farmers were eaten by pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs aren't always aggressive but the taste of blood can act as a "pencetus."
They're just playing.
They're nippers, so curious... they don't come out to hurt you.
You just have to pay the right amount of respect," he said.
Rose's excess hurricane brings heavy rain to the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Taufan Rosa became weaker as it moved into cold water waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
Rosa, however, will bring heavy rains in northern Mexico and southwestern the U.S. the next day.
Rosa has winds of 85 mph, Storm Category 1, until 5 a.m. East time Sunday, and is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the ridge that began to form in the Pacific Ocean and moved east towards the U.S. West Coast as Rosa approached the California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it began to reject the tropics northwest of the U.S.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical moisture interacts with the approaching buoy that creates heavy rain in the Southwest the next day.
Within the country, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause hazardous flooding, fissile flows and land likely to collapse in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates of about 2 to 3 inches an hour in places, especially in the southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in the southwestern part, especially more than Arizona.
Floods of lightning may be in poor condition due to tropical rainfall.
It is highly recommended to melt into the desert with the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can lead to flooding rivers and thunderstorms that will bring the country strong winds and dust blowing.
Nearby slopes will bring heavy rain on the southern coast of California.
The amount of rain over half an inch may occur, which can lead to a small flow of cracks and smooth roads.
It became the first rainfall in the region during the drought season.
Some tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona through Sunday and early Monday, before rains become further through Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rains will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and the last on Wednesday.
In October you can see some extreme temperature changes crossing the U.S. when the Arctic gets colder, but the tropical region remains a bit warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes with short-distance temperatures.
There is a great example of the temperature difference through the U.S. center on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the heat of the summer will try to build and develop again.
Most of the central and eastern U.S. are expected to witness a warm start to October with the 80s extending from the South Plains to the Northeast.
New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which estimates 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecasts show high chances for above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. through the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watch Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people witnessed shocking testimony on Thursday by the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly committed in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television channels.
Meanwhile, political blockades continued, with broadcasters disrupting regular programming for Friday's last-minute touch: a deal designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh was stalking him and trying to undress him at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his statement, said 100 percent would not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people were reported by Nielsen on Friday watching it.
The company estimates the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers are not immediately available for other networks showing PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Networks.
And Nielsen usually has trouble measuring people watching in the office.
To put in perspective, it's the same audience size as a soccer game or Academy Award.
Fox News Channel, which says the host has supported Kavanaugh's nomination, led all the networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers listening throughout the day, Nielsen said.
ABC is second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC has 2.89 million and CNN has 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The benefits remain high after hearing.
Flake is the main character in Friday's drama.
After a simple Republican official released his statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was arrested as a CNN and CBS camera on Friday morning screamed by sentimental indicators as he tried to take the elevator to the hearing of the Justice Committee.
He stood with a lack of effort for a few minutes when he preached, broadcast live on CNN.
"I stand here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth?"
He was told, "You have power when many women don't have power."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator was closed, he would say a lot at the committee hearing.
Cable networks and broadcasts all covered hours immediately afterwards, when the Judiciary Committee voted to advance Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate to vote.
But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI will see charges against the pro-democracy minority activists next week.
Flake is confident that part of the conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After the Coons and several senators' conversations thereafter, Flake made a decision.
This Flake option has power indeed, as it is clear that Republicans will not have a lottery to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union "playing politics" with Britain's future and affecting the country's interests in a talks with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, September 29, 2018.
In another talks with him on the newspaper's front page, former foreign minister Boris Johnson stressed his alleged attack as Checkers for Brexit, saying Britain and the EU's proposals should collect tariffs each "completely unreasonable."
Wayde Sims shooter: Police detain suspect Dyteon Simpson with death of LSU player
Police have detained suspects in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at the LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and placed in prison on charges of murdering two graders, Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said the Sims lost their eyeglasses during the fight.
Police recovered the mirrors from the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA in them, CBS affiliate WAFB reported.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted Wayde was physically shot dead.
The bond has been set at <0x24>350,000, Defenders report.
The East Baton Rouge Coroner's office issued an early report on Friday, saying the cause of the death was a gunshot wound in the head to the neck.
The department credits the Louisiana State Police evacuation force, the state police crime lab, the University of the South Police and locals in aiding the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the law enforcement for "sustainability and justice efforts."
Sims is 20 years old.
6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
He scored 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the squad was "disappointed" and "surprised" by Wayde's death.
"That's what you worry about all the time," Wade said.
Volcano explodes in Mexico City
Dust stretches from the Popocatepetl volcano to the southern part of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after increased activity in the crater and it registered 183 gas and dust releases for 24 hours.
The center monitors a variety of earthquakes and earthquakes.
Images on social media show a thin layer of the car's windscreen on the ash cover in residential areas in Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists are aware of increased activity in the volcano, located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the country's capital since the 7.1 magnitude earthquake ravaged Central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan supporters on the anniversary of independence voting
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters came in contact with riot police, and thousands joined demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the Catalan separatist polarization election.
A masked pro-separation group held by riot police ejected them with eggs and released paint powder, making dark clouds on the streets that tourists usually visit.
The riots also occurred later with the police using their sticks to fight.
A few hours later, the pro-independence group slammed "No Forgetting, No Forgiveness" in the face of a demonstrator of unionist sentiment shouting, "Spanish Life."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries in protests, local media reported.
Tensions remained high in the independence region a year after the October 1 vote was described as illegal by Madrid but welcomed by the Catalan separatists.
Voters chose the whole to be free, although the percentage of voting out was low with those who opposed the separation mostly boycotting the vote.
Catalan authorities said nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the elections taking place at a polling station across the region in violent fighting.
Pro-independence groups camped on Friday to prevent demonstrations supporting the state police.
The demonstration took place but had to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hoped for Catalonia's prospects of independence.
"Last year we went through one of our best moments in life.
I saw my parents cry happy because they could vote but now we're blocked," he said.
While governance is important if it approaches victory in regional elections in December, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain this year's momentum with famous leaders whose many are either in exile or in detention to await trial for their role in organizing a referendum and a declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded protests against police support on her phone, said the conflict had been voiced by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in prison before trial since the end of last year, announced he would contest the European Parliament elections next year.
"Competing as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression in the values of democracy and oppression that we see from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Man detained after being housed in a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after the same car crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 BST.
Det Insp Bob Blemmings said the damage was caused by the door and the building itself.
A crossroads A may also have fired on the car at a time.
Menga Attack Gives Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston wins
Livingston's rise surprised the Rangers to hand over Steven Gerrard to a second loss in 18 games as manager of club Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's attack proved to be different when Gary Holt's team moved with the Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team remained victorious in the Premiership this season and faced the head of the Hearts, which they will track with eight points, next Sunday.
Earlier, the Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended the run without losing in this section to six games, with head coach Holt still feeling a loss since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed a chance against the opponent
Holt's team was supposed to be far ahead before scoring goals, with their involvement causing the Rangers to face all the problems.
Scott Robinson broke it but surrendered his effort over the goal, but Alan Lithgow could only surrender his effort after slipping to Craig Halkett's arm.
The hosts are passionate about letting the Rangers play in front of them, realizing they can give the opponents a problem with the set pieces.
And that’s how important goals are.
The Rangers acknowledged a free pair and Livingston opened the curtains, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to establish Menga, who took the touch and net goal from the center of the box.
At that stage, the Rangers had mastered possession but had found home defenses that couldn't penetrate and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely in trouble.
The pattern continued to the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to save.
Scott Pittman was rejected by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow scored from another Livingston match.
Crosses continued into the Livingston box and continued to clear, while two penalty claims - after Halkett's replacement challenge Glenn Middleton, and one for the handball - went a long way.
'Phenomena' from Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Excellent performance and results for Livingston.
For men, they are very brilliant, continuing beyond expectations on this upward trajectory.
Their style of play and staff have barely changed since returning to the top ranks, but big credits have had to go to Holt for him to launch the team since he arrived.
He has a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was very brave, creating a great regular defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall across his toes.
Rangers are less inspiring, though.
Good as they are sometimes under Gerrard, they fall away from that standard.
The last ball was a bit short – only once they cut the host team – and it was a call for the Rangers to wake up, who found themselves at the middle table.
Erdogan has received a number of awards in Cologne.
There was a smile and a blue sky on Saturday (September 29) as the Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - aimed at improving ties with NATO allies.
They discussed issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's participation in the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
The city is the largest home of Turkish residents outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons for blocking 25,000 strong people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many nearby supporters wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - most of them Kurds - also made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
War resistance depicts the fate of a visitor praised as a hero by some Turks and fired as an autocrat by others.
Deptford Highway Accident: Bicycle rider dies in car crash
A cyclist died in a breach involving a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the south-east of the airport, around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped and the paramedic arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The incident occurred months after another cyclist died in a run on Childers Road, about a mile from Saturday's accident.
Metropolitan Police said the officer was trying to identify the man and inform his heirs.
Closed roads and bus lanes in place and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Injured in Disorder
Six prison officials were injured in disturbances in a high-security man's prison, the prison official said.
The disturbance occurred at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST on Sunday and is ongoing.
Officials of the expert "Tornado" have been brought in to deal with the disturbance, which involved eight residents and has one wing.
Officers have been treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A Prison Service spokesman said: "Trained prison staff have been assigned to handle the ongoing events at HMP Long Lartin.
Six members of staff have been treated for injuries.
We don't resist the acts of violence in our prison, and obviously they're responsible for referring to the police and could spend more time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 detainees, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June he was reported to have received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year riot officers had been called to prison to deal with a serious disturbance where staff were attacked with a pool ball.
Hurricane Pink Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Smoke Floods
It rarely applies to tropical depression affecting Arizona, but that's what might happen next week when Hurricane Rosa windmills cross the Southwest Desert, the risk of lightning floods.
The National Weather Service has issued flash flooding hours for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take her way over Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching through the night with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet only "ten tropical tits remain stormy or depressed status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a typhoon within 40 miles of the AZ border."
The latest model of the National Heritage Center predicts 2 to 4 inches of rainfall down, with a remote amount of up to 6 inches in the Rim Mogollon in Arizona.
Other areas in the Southwest Desert including the Rockies center and the Great Basin will probably get 1 to 2 inches, with a number so remote as to possibly 4 inches.
For them from the risk of lightning floods, the Rosa rain may have been a blessing since the region was hit by drought.
Although flooding is a serious concern, some rainfall will benefit since the Southwest is now undergoing drought.
According to the U.S. Surveillance Surveillance, more than 40 percent of Arizona experience the worst drought, the second highest category, "reported by weather.com.
First, the Hurricane Rosa route leads to land on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, having a peak Sunday morning tufting force with a maximum wind of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moves north with 12 miles per hour.
Storms face cold waters in the Pacific and thus generate a downturn.
Hence, it is expected that landfall in Mexico on tropical storm power in the evening or evening on Monday.
Rainfall throughout Mexico can be severe, leading to a high risk of flooding.
"The total rainfall of 3 to 6 inches is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, so maybe 10 inches," reported by weather.com.
Rosa will follow north across Mexico as a tropical storm before arriving at the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, then trail through Arizona and south to Utah in late Tuesday night.
"The main dangers expected from the Rosa or sprawl are very heavy rains in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and U.S. Southwest deserts," said the National Research Center.
It is expected that the rain will result in lightning floods that threaten the lives and flows of fragments in the desert, and land collapses in mountain areas.
Norton Midsomer Attack: Four Attempts to Kill
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old man was found wounded in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital where he remained in "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old man, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested last night in the Radstock, Avon and Somerset areas, police said.
Employees are appealing to those who may have a cell phone record about what's going on to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'suffered, meaningless, angry' Democratic Party
"Judge Kavanaugh's office is a vote to reject cruel and excessive tactics in the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered "very badly, furiously" from the Democratic Party throughout his candidacy process.
Kavanaugh gave a statement before Congress on Thursday, firmly and resolutely denying the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford she sexually assaulted during a decade of teenage years.
Ford also testified at the hearing of his accusations.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw the excellence and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh on that day.
"One vote to verify Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to verify one of the most successful legal minds at the moment, a lawyer with outstanding records in public service," he said to the people who support West Virginia.
The president simultaneously referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when discussing the importance of the Republican election in the umus election.
"In five weeks, it's one of the most important choices in our lives.
I didn't run, but I really ran," he said.
"That's why I'm in a place that fights for great candidates."
Trump argues that the Democrats are on a mission to "refuse and prevent."
The first major procedure in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to be carried out not later than Friday, the GOP's senior assistant leadership has told CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquakes in Indonesia, tsunami, with toll numbers increasing
At least 384 people were killed, many were smashed by a giant wave stranded off the coast, when an earthquake and a major tsunami struck Indonesia's island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach celebration in the city of Palu on Friday when a six-meter (18-foot) wave blew up on the ground at noon, wiped out many deaths and destroyed anything on their way.
Tsunami followed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat emerged last night, people were still doing activities on the beach and did not run and eventually they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesian disaster arrest agency BNPB, said in a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come on its own, it pulled cars, trenches, homes, it attacked everyone on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 mph) before a hit on the edge.
Some people climbed a tree to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people have been relocated to 24 centers in Palou.
Air images issued by the disaster agency show many buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges were turned and collapsed and a mosque was surrounded by water.
The end-of-the-moment storm continued to ravage the city on the coast on Saturday.
Several follow-up movements were felt in an area with 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Agency for Research and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by a powerful earthquake on Friday was about 200 times that of the atomic bombs dropped in Hiroshima during World War II.
The city located at the end of a long and narrow bay may have increased the size of the tsunami, the agency said.
Nugroho described the destruction as ‘expanding’ and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said the bodies were found trapped under the collapse of the building and said another 540 people were injured and 29 people were still missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and destruction may be more terrible along the 300 km (190 kilometers) coastline north of Palu, an area called Donggala. It is close to the center of the earthquake.
"Communication was completely interrupted without any information' from Donggala," Nugroho said.
"More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were heading to the affected area.
"It's a tragedy but it could be even worse," the Red Cross said.
The agency was heavily criticized last Saturday for not informing that the tsunami had struck Palu despite officials saying the tsunami occurred within the warning period.
In an amateur video on social media, the voice of a man on top of the building shouted to the crowd on the road about the presence of a tsunami.
Within minutes, the tsunami swept the beach and attracted along with the buildings and cars.
Reuters cannot confirm the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami resulted in large power leaks that deciphered communications around Palu and this shifted the authorities to carry out search efforts.
The military has sent aid by cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities but the displaced population still needs food and other basic necessities, the authorities said.
The airport has been reopened for aid only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit a transfer center in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 800 people.
The situation is very bad.
While the World Vision Staff from Donggala had survived to the city of Palu, they passed through the site of the disaster. The workers sheltered under a tarpaulin cloth set up on the front page of their office in Palu, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed," he said.
The situation is very bad.
Although aid forces began providing disaster relief in a quiet environment, some said foreign aid workers with deep experience were prevented from heading to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, the financing, supply of supplies of requirements and the delivery of workers from abroad can only be carried out if the disaster zone is declared a disaster zone of the state.
It still hasn't happened.
"It is still a disaster at the regional level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross Force.
"When the government says, 'OK, this is a state disaster,' we can only receive help from overseas, but for now there is no status anymore."
When the second night arrives in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, the friends and families of the missing victims hope that their loved ones will be a miracle that emerges and make them feel sad.
On Saturday, a boy was found in the fortress.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued the victim of a woman trapped under a rock collapse for two days with her mother's body lying next door.
Gendon Subandono, Indonesian national paratrooper coach, has trained two paratroopers who are missing as a result of the earthquake for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among the people trapped in Hotel Roa Roa were his students, Mr. Mandagi said.
"As a senior in the field of parachute, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon tells how he was serious about sending a WhatsApp message to the parachute participants in Palu who joined the beach festival after hours of news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel spread among the parachute community.
Messages sent have only one grey ray sign compared to two blue ray signs.
"I don't think the message came," he said.
Thieves steal <0x24>26,750 during ATM recharge at Newport on the Levee
The thief stole <0x24>26,750 from Brink employees who filled the money at the Newport ATM on the Levee on Friday, according to news issued by the Newport Police Department.
The Brink employee emptied an ATM in the entertainment complex and was willing to send more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While Brink’s worker was busy doing his job, a man ‘runs backwards’ and steals a bag full of money.
Witnesses were seen as several suspects fleeing the scene on the basis of the report, but police did not state how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about the thief should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rap singer changed his name to Ye
Rap singer Kanye West changed her name to Ye.
Announced her name change on Twitter on Saturday, she wrote: "This man is officially known as Kanye West."
Kanye West, 41, was named Ye for a moment and she used the nickname as the title of her eighth album released in June.
The change took place when he appeared on Saturday Night Live where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
"He replaced the singer Ariana Grande who cancelled her appearance in the show over an 'emotional problem'," the show's creator said.
Earlier, Kanye West said that the name had a religious meaning and is also an abbreviation for his professional name now.
"I believe 'yes' is a common word often found in the Gospels and it means 'you'," Kanye West said earlier this year when discussing the title of her album with Big Boy's radio host.
"So I'm you too. I'm us too. We're us.
He switched from Kanye which meant only one, to Ye - an image of our goodness, evil and mistakes and all.
It's more of a picture of our own."
She was one of the famous rap singers who changed her name.
Sean Combs is known by various names such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy but this year he announced that he preferred the name Love and Brother Love.
Former partner of Kanye West, JAY-Z can also receive it without or with a cross and capital letters.
Mexico’s President, AMLO, has resigned from military action against civilians.
Mexico's president-elect, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has vowed not to use military action against civilians when the country is nearing its 50th anniversary of the bloody retaliation of students.
AMLO promised at Plaza Tlatelolco on Saturday that it "will never use the military to curb Mexicans."
The military fired at civilians who carried out a safe demonstration in the plaza on October 2, 1968, which had killed 300 civilians during the leftist student movement began to stand across Latin America.
AMLO vowed to support young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to those who are studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attracted young people to engage in crime gangs.
The U.S. has doubled its investment in artificial intelligence.
"The U.S. should double the amount of funding in the field of artificial intelligence as China becomes increasingly active in the field," said Kai-Fu Lee, an artificial intelligence investor who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The view was expressed after the U.S. government made an announcement about artificial intelligence, even though the U.S. itself at large lacked an official artificial intelligence strategy.
China, meanwhile, introduced its plan last year with the goal of becoming number one in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"Making the designation of artificial intelligence studies is a good start as all other countries are far behind the United States and we want to achieve further success in artificial intelligence," Lee said.
"By doubling the funds, it could increase the chances of the next major achievement of artificial intelligence (AI) in the United States," Lee said in a talks with CNBC this week.
Lee’s book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order’ was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcout, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China’s most renowned companies, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s, he pursued an artificial intelligence system that had defeated the best-ranked American Othello player while still studying at Carnegie Mellon University. Later, he became executive at Microsoft Research and chairman of Google branch China.
Lee recognizes previous U.S. government tech competitions such as the Robot Challenge from the Defense Intelligence Research Project Agency and wants to know when the next match will be held so that he can identify new talents.
"Researchers in the United States usually need to work hard to win government aid," Lee said.
"It's not China that takes the academic leaders, but the corporate companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been nominating the great talents of the university to work in artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policies could also help the United States support its artificial intelligence efforts.
"I think the green card should be offered automatically to PhD graduates in artificial intelligence," he said.
China's State Council issued a Future Generation of Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
"The National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funds to people in academic institutions. It equals how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations allocate funds to U.S. researchers but the quality of academic work in China is lower," Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence that aims to gather partners from industry and academia. The White House announced the line of the Selected Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a <0x24>2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF invests more than <0x24>100 million annually in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. law ranks trying to establish the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence were not seen running in the last few months.
Macedonians voted to change the name of the country
The Macedonians voted on the day of the ceremony to determine the name change to ‘North Macedonia Republic’. An action that will resolve a dispute with Greece that has been settled for a decade in which Greece has prevented Macedonia from joining the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
Greece, which has its own territory called Macedonia, has confirmed that the name ‘Macedonia’ represents claims against its territory and has vetoed to refuse Macedonia’s participation in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached agreement on a proposal to change names in June, but nationalists said the conversion undermined Macedonia's ethnic identity, with a majority of its population being Slavic.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the vote and the start raises doubts as to whether the vote will reach the minimum 50 percent of the vote required for the vote to be valid.
The question on the ballot paper read: "Do you agree to join NATO and the EU with an agreement with Greece?"
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, said: "Accepting a new name is a price worth paying to join the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country and for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the European Union because that means our lives are safer," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legal on the side of the law, MPs said they would comply with the vote's decision to make it final.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The country's electoral commission said there was no report on things that were not in accordance with the rules until 1 p.m.
However, the voter turnout was 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent in the 2016 parliamentary election after 66 per cent of voters registered to drop the ballot papers.
"I came to vote for my children. Our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife and their son Dushko threw away vote papers in Macedonia for a country's name change that would pave the way for Macedonia to join NATO and the EU in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, is setting up a small stage and placing chairs in front of a tent set up by the people who boycotted the referendum.
"We want to join NATO and the EU but we want to join it with pride rather than through this," Kavadarkov said.
"We are poor people, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to see us as Macedonians, we can turn towards China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said his involvement in NATO would provide sufficient investment to Macedonia where his unemployment rate exceeds 20 percent.
I believe the vast majority will accept it because more than 80 percent of our population voted for the EU and NATO," Zaev said.
He said the “yes” decision was “confirmation of our future.”
One poll was published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Police Survey which said between 30 to 43 percent of voters would take part in the poll - below the required amount.
Another lottery, run by Macedonian TV Telma, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For a vote to be successful, the number of voters who came must be 50 percent more than one vote.
Failure in voting will be considered the first serious blow to pro-Western government police since taking over in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City navigates across Brighton's entire line of defense to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were sent as Brighton's defense at Manchester City and won 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made him look extremely happy on his net at the minute 65.
Argentina's attackers received a message in the middle of the field at the start of the order.
He raced between three Brighton defenses, before cutting into the open field.
Then Aguero finds himself surrounded by four green-dressed players.
He refused a defense before chasing a few more people on the edge of the Brighton box.
Then he refused to send to the left, looking for Sterling.
The forward used his first touch inside the box to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right-button to kill Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with one kick to the right of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with his leg problems," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored a goal at the time."
But Sterling gave the Sky Blues an early lead in the Premier League match.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the inner ball in the Brighton area on the match.
He made a beautiful ball delivery through the left wing to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few touches before leading Sterling to a distant position.
Sky Blues forward football the ball into the net before sliding out of the limit.
City against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group played at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer just wants to play against the Rockies.
With the Nationals team getting rid of the playoffs, there's not much reason to force another start.
But highly competitive Scherzer hopes to face the fort on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there is a play-out implications for the Rockies, who hold one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
The Rockies embraced at least a special place with 5-2 wins over the Nationals on Friday night, but were still looking to lock down their first-party champions.
"While we're just playing, at least we can get to know the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and other teams will probably play at the highest level I'll face this year.
Why don't I want to compete in that?"
The Nationals have not yet announced a beginner for Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to allow Scherzer to make a move in this situation.
Scherzer, who will start at 34, will hold a body warming session on Thursday and will make a dip on his usual rest day on Sunday.
The goalkeeper who used the right hand of Washington was 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 shots right in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump's meeting in West Virginia
The president by not directly referring to the situation around the Supreme Court elected Brett Kavanaugh while speaking about the importance of the number of Republicans coming in the mid-term elections.
"Everything we've done will be at stake in November.
Five weeks to face the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not competing but I'm very competing and that's why I'm in all the places fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump added: "You see this bad Democratic radical group, you see it's happening right now.
And they are serious about taking back power by using whatever method, you see atrocities, evil.
They don't care who they hurt, who they need to hide in order to gain power and kavala. What they want is power and control, we won't give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to “refuse and block.”
“And you’ve seen it for the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “rage, evil and untrue.”
He referred to Senator Justice Committee position Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, who had received a strong boo from the audience.
"Do you remember his answer?
You've leaked the documents?
Uh, uh, what.
No, I'm waiting for one - it's a very bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
Work is no longer a large church.
It's not tolerable to anyone who expresses their views.
When the momentum activists in the local party voted to condemn me, it didn't bother me.
After all, I am the latest in the AP Labour line informed that we are not welcome - all because of our voices
My colleague Joan Ryan received almost the same treatment because he supported anti-Jews.
In my case, the criticism movement has criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
In the interest of responsibility for economic policy, for national security, for Europe, whose ironic issue is almost the same as what Jeremy did not approve of with the previous leader.
A meeting note for the Nottingham East Labour Party on Friday said that "we want a meeting that encompasses everything and is productive."
For almost eight years as a local Labour AP, the GC meeting on Friday night really encompassed it all.
Sadly today, it’s not a tone for many meetings and political promises ‘better, softer’ have long been forgotten if, indeed, it ever began.
It is becoming more apparent that differences of opinion are unacceptable in the Labour Party and every opinion will be judged whether it is accepted by the party's leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, as a former colleague, I think I share a political view that almost the same began to expect me to make the U round and take a position that I would not agree - either on national security or the EU single market.
When I speak outside - and it doesn't matter what I say - then I will be followed by condemnation for abuse on social media, ordered not to vote, condemned the political center, ordered me out of the Labour Party.
And that's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I'm more fortunate than my colleagues because commenting on me is more about politics.
I'm impressed with the professional attitude and the hard work of colleagues who are sworn in every sexist and abusive every day but never give up.
One aspect of this era's political disappointment is how the level of hostility has become accustomed.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn demanded that the Labour Party foster cultural tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer a large church and with every ‘non-believing’ proposal or change in election rules, the party becomes increasingly narrow.
I received a lot of advice from two years ago encouraging me to remain silent, not too prominent and then I’ll be ‘be good.’
But that's not my goal in politics.
Since I joined the 32-year-old Labour as a school pupil, raised by Thatcher's government's dismissal that allowed my entire class to be destroyed, I've tried to lead a better public service for those in need - whether as a local council member or government minister.
I've never concealed my politics, including in the last election.
"Nobody in Nottingham East may be mistaken about my position and the opposing side with the leadership right now.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, what I want to say is that when the country rejects Brexit, it will haunt our households, our businesses and our public services, I don't understand the feeling of wasting my time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But the only message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it's to my voters, whether the Labour member or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise unelected threats or political adequacy won't stop me from acting in what I believe is for the sake of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: An unbeatable Ayr climbing to the top
Two slow attempts may make the final decision slippery, but there is no doubt Ayr deserves success in this exciting and entertaining Premiership match Tennent.
They are now at the top of the table, the only one who has never lost from 10 people.
Finally, their superior defense, as much as they took the chance, made the host team and coach Peter Murchie happy.
"We've been tested on our game so far, and we're still invincible, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Congratulations to Ayr, they took a better chance than us."
Grant Anderson made an experiment at the 14th minute, a conversion by Frazier Climo, putting Ayr in front, but, a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, issued for the match by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to make the net and Jason Baggot captured a non-conversioned experiment.
Climo preceded Ayr with a penalty, before, in half time, he scored then a solo conversion attempt to make 17-5 to Ayr at rest.
But Melrose started the second season well and Patrick Anderson's experiment, a conversion by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
There was a long delay due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who was brought out, and from the beginning, Ayr continued forward again through Stafford McDowall's experiment, conversion by Climo.
Captain Ayr Blair Macpherson's wedding was then given a yellow card, and once again, Melrose retaliated the extra player with a non-conversion attempt Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of intense pressure.
The host team returned, however, and when Hutchinson's Struan was given a yellow card due to Climo's ball-less kick, from the penalty line, MacPherson broke behind the front-runner.
Climo conversion, as he did almost like a start again, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's box punch and sent away flanker Gregor Henry for the fifth try of the host team.
Star Still Game is seen to be ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran was seen ready to move into the hospitality industry after he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old starred as Jack Jarvis in the BBC show, where he wrote and starred alongside old comedy couple Greg Hemphill.
The couple have announced that the upcoming ninth series is the last in the plan, and it seems Kiernan is planning a lifetime after Craiglang.
According to the official record report, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although Scottish Sun sources gave the shadow that Kiernan wanted to engage in an ‘advanced restaurant business.’
'The sea is ours': Bolivia surrounded by land hopes the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Marines in the Navy's office in La Paz.
The public building spreads the blue flag of the sea.
The naval base from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon was engraved with a motto: 'The sea is really ours.
Getting back is a responsibility."
Throughout Bolivia surrounded by land, the memory of the loss of coast to Chile in the bloody conflict of the 19th century is still clear - like a desire to navigate the Pacific Ocean once again.
This is probably the highest hope of the century, as Bolivia is still awaiting a decision from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of discussion.
“Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and tranquility, and of course hopes for a positive decision,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ's decision on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will support Bolivia's claim that - after a debate - Chile is forced to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign outlet to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic original president of Bolivia - who faces a controversial contest for next year's re-election - also has a lot of interest in Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he recalled at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will not make a decision in favour of Bolivia - and if it happens a little bit it will change greatly.
The U.N. agency based in the Netherlands has no authority to award the area to Chile, and has determined that it will not determine the outcome for possible talks.
About the ICJ's decision that will come out only after six months of the final argument is heard suggesting the case was "uncomplicated," said Paz Zárate, an international legal expert in Chile.
And not to further slow down Bolivia's policy, for these four years there may be obstacles.
"Jesus for the way into the sea has been kidnapped by the Bolivian administration now," Zárate said.
Morales' rhetorical hostility has reduced Chile's little compassion, he suggests.
Bolivia and Chile at one time will continue to talk, but it will be too difficult to hold talks afterwards.
Both countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltsé, Bolivia's deputy in The Hague, rejected the idea that court decisions would usually be swift.
Monday will bring Bolivia "a great opportunity to open up a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end a 139-year-long dispute for the common good," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of the famous presidents in Latin America - used maritime issues as political aid.
"Bolivia has never lost its right to a direct route to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"This decision is an opportunity to see that we need to forget the past."
North Korea says a nuclear ceasefire will not take place unless it trusts the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would not carry out their nuclear weapons truce first if it did not trust Washington.
He spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to implement the promises made during a summit in Singapore between rival leaders.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to want to restart nuclear diplomacy that was halted more than three months after Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was "just a dream" that continued restrictions and the U.S. opposition to the declaration of an end to the Korean War would cause North Korea to surrender.
Washington has been cautious to agree to a declaration without Pyongyang having previously taken important action to cease arms.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is indeed serious about launching weapons that are seen as the only way to guarantee the security of its country.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month for preparations for the second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris Fashion Show introduces the latest design of a great head decoration on its way to your nearby main road.
If you want to add your hat collection or block the sunlight completely, then you don't have to look far.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a wide variety of odd-sized head decorations for their SS19 collection on top of the styling scene that embellished a set of styles on Paris Fashion Week.
The impractical hats have wiped out Instagram this summer and these designers have sent their inspiring designs to the showcase.
The design that stands out by Valentino is a great water yellow hat decorated with thick imitation feathers that broadly cover the model's head.
Other large-sized accessories include jewelry decorated tambourines, smart hats and even nails - but it's not designed to make your head hot.
Thom Browne also reveals the choice of strange masks - and the right time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks have been stitched on his lips and more resembled Hannibal Lecter than a handsome fashion.
One design resembles a scuba diving equipment equipped with snorkels and gogols, while another looks like a liquid ice cream cone.
And if you continue with the reality of great fashion - you're lucky.
The style viewer predicts that a very large bonet may be heading towards your main road nearby.
The large-sized hats are warmer than 'La Bomba', the straw hats with a full two-legged width have been seen worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The king of the label behind the very impractical hat had been worn on social media sent another big design to the scene of the event - a straw beach bag nearly the same size as the model covered in a bathtub he wore.
The rafia bag is flammable, decorated with rafia stitched and paired with a white holder, which stands out in Jacquemus' collection La Riviera SS19 in Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to be able to see large hats and beach bags arrive on the main road for the upcoming summer - as designers have made a very big and difficult impression of allowing a request for large-sized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are very important for global citizens
Scottish private schools maintain a record of achievement for academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding exam outcomes, reinforced by individuals and collective success in sports, arts, music and other community ventures.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, this school, represented by the Scottish Institute of Private Schools (SCIS), strives to provide services at the best rank to their students and parents.
The goal of private schools is to prepare their students to pursue higher education, their careers of choice, and their place as global citizens.
As a sector of education that they can and implement an earlier school curriculum, we see modern language continuing to be famous and the subject of the yamg choice is desired within the school.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to someone in a language that he understands, it's going to go into his head.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, it will enter his heart."
This is a strong warning that we cannot rely only on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year's exam results, we can see which language is the top subject in the league table with the highest graduation rates in private schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learn a foreign language get a higher grade A.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS school members, showed that 72 percent of students received a higher A grade in Mandarin, while 72 percent of them studied German, 69 percent of them studied French and 63 percent of them also learned Spanish.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign language as an important skill that children and young people are no longer likely to need in the future.
Language now, as a subject of choice, is being held the same as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in private schools curriculum and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found the reasons employers struggle to fill the gap, 17 percent being linked to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, over and over again, language skills become a firm foundation to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more prospective job opportunities requiring language, these skills are crucial in this global world.
Regardless of a person's career choice, if they learn a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future by having a lifelong skill like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from a foreign country will put someone who has mastered many languages automatically ahead of the competition.
According to the YouGov poll of over 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough for conversation, with French as a conversational language used only by two digits percent, 15 percent.
This is why investing in language teaching is important for children today.
Having multiple languages, especially the country is building its economy, will equip children with better chances of finding meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, each school will be different in the language they learn.
Bebrapa schools will focus on more modern classical languages, while others will teach languages that are seen as crucial to the UK when looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there are always a lot of languages to choose from in-school-as if private, with a specialist faculty in that section.
Scottish private schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills necessary to succeed, whatever happens in the future.
It is undeniable at this time, in the global business environment, that language continues to be very important to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern language should be regarded as ‘international communication skills’.
Private schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Board of Scottish Private Schools
LeBron will make the Lakers' first appearance on Sunday in San Diego
Expectations are almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening match before the season on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he will play is not yet determined.
"It'll be more than one and less than 48 minutes," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell predicted that James might be playing in a limited minute.
Following training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for a six-game schedule ahead of the Lakers season.
"I don't need a game before the season to be ready for this stage of my career," he said.
Trump's meeting time in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump launched a pressing rally campaign tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It was the first of five Trump meetings scheduled for next week, including stopping in friendly places including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote held for him to choose to fill the void in the Federal Court, Trump aims to gain support for the upcoming mid-term election because Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the vote is decided in November.
What time is Trump meeting in West Virginia tonight and how do you watch it online?
Trump's meeting at Wheeling in West Virginia is scheduled at 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's meeting in West Virginia online via streaming live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to deal with this week's trial for federal court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense over allegations of sexual misconduct with a Senate vote confirmation expected to be detained for a week during an FBI investigation.
But the main goal of this hurried assembly is to help the Republicans gain momentum in the face of the November election.
Trump's campaign said the five meetings in the coming week were to "enforce volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and develop the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so critical to his agenda that the president will go to as many countries as possible within our country towards a busy campaign season," Trump's unnamed campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Scheduled at the Wesbanko Arena in Wheeling, the meeting could bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw coverage from the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, a country he won more than 40 percent of his eyes in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Party Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is choking him in the election.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president needs to come to support him," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. forces show courage to fight in ensuring hopes are still on the way to a solo match on Sunday
After three heavy matches on the side, the corner match on Saturday evening was probably what the Ryder Cup needed this time.
The swinging momentum is the concept of sports that is an invention but it is truly trusted by the players, and more so in games like this.
So where is the momentum now?
"They have a six-eyed advantage and now it's four-eyed, so we bring a little momentum, I think," said Jordan Spieth as he walked at the end of the day.
Europe certainly has an advantage, four points ahead with another twelve points to take.
American players, as Spieth said, feel they have a little bit of advantage and a sense of urgency, not just from Spieth and Justin Thomas who play together throughout the day and each have three out of four points.
Spieth displays the poisonous game from the beginning to the green area and serves as an example to other players.
The vibrant chanting sounds louder as he keeps waving, making an important sneeze to match four eyes when he and Thomas are missing after two eyes.
His batting that gave them victory in the 15th hole was greeted with the same praise, which told you that he believed the American troops were still fighting.
"You just have to work harder and worry about your own match," Spieth said.
That’s all there is for all of these players right now.
18 holes to show power.
Only two players with more eyes than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unmistakable story in the Ryder Cup.
The pair of players are different characters from this fascinating European but charming four-pointer out of four and apparently won't make any mistakes.
"Moliwood" is the only couple that does not make a nap on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoid a nap on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
The period and how their energy was given and shown by supporters is evidence that they are players to be killed on Sunday, and no more popular players to curb the possibility of a European win at sunset at Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
It's best for them both in different holes.
However, the talks about the victory of the European troops are too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson facilitated the work of Sergio Garcia, a four-player hero this morning, when he was compared to Alex Noren.
One bow and two doubles in the first nine holes overwhelm the Spanish and Swedish players.
However, on Sunday, no one can help you.
Four balls and four players are very interesting to watch closely due to the interactions between pairs, advice given and not given and strategies that can change in one eye.
Europe has been playing better as a team so far and far ahead on the last day but this fourth session also shows U.S. forces have the courage previously doubted by many parties, including local fans.
European teams ahead 10-6 towards the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe brought a comfortable advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after rising out of a four-ball and four-player match with a 10-6 score over the United States.
Both great players, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari advanced with two victories over Tiger Woods who were struggling to bring their victory at Le Golf National to four points.
The European squad led by Thomas Bjorn tried to keep the trophy taken at Hazeltine two years ago, dominating the American squad full of mistakes on a four-ball morning session, with a 3-1 lead.
The U.S. teams provide more competition in the four-player game, winning two games, but are unable to bridge the gap.
Jim Furyk's team needed 8 points out of 12 in Sunday's singles match to maintain the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first new European player to win four consecutive goals during his and Molinari, who were named "Molliwood" after a thrilling weekend was the second pair to win four points out of their four opening matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After destroying Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they later together defeated Woods and American new player, Bryson Dechambeau in a 5&4 match.
Woods, who went through two difficult matches on Saturday, showed excellence but has now lost in 19 of 29 games four balls and four players and seven consecutively.
Justin Rose, who did not play a break during the four-ball morning session, rematched with Henrik Stenson in a four-player match to defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka in 2&1 - occupying ranks one and three in the world.
Europe is not lucky on a quiet and relaxed day in southwestern Paris.
Three-time major champions winners, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas became the benchmarkers for America with two eyes on Saturday.
They won 2&1 victories killing Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in a four-ball match and then again killing Poulter and Rory McIlroy in a 4&3 match in a four-player game that was killed on two opening holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup a team that missed four points headed for the individual match, although as a defending champion the Furyk team only needed a series to maintain the trophy.
After occupying second place for two days, Sunday's retaliatory attacks seemed beyond their reach.
North Korea says it is 'impossible' to voluntarily remove weapons without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued restrictions had led to a deep feeling of distrust of the United States and that it was unlikely its country would voluntarily release nuclear weapons in the situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Health Organization's Annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant change measures" last year, such as halting nuclear tests and guided missiles, closing nuclear testing sites and promising not to expand the use of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we don't see any appropriate response from the United States," he said.
"Without any trust in the United States, there would be no trust in the security of our country and in such a situation, it would be impossible for us to get rid of the weapons hard first."
Although Ri denounced North Korea's opposition to Washington's "stupid" approach to nuclear endings in which North Korea would be rewarded for taking steps gradually, the reality appears to be important because it does not reject a voluntary rejection as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the U.S. president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim vowed to seek a "nuclear deterrence on the Korean peninsula" while Trump gave assurances to North Korea's security.
North Korea tried to find an end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said that Pyongyang should release its nuclear weapons first.
Washington is also reluctant to follow the advice to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
"The U.S. affirmed "preliminary observation" and increased the level of pressure in the restrictions to achieve their goals by force, and even opposed the "end-of-war declaration," Ri said.
"The realization that restrictions can weaken us is the empty dream of those who don't recognize us.
But the problem is the continued restrictions that are deteriorating our sense of distrust."
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump mediated by the U.S. leader at the UN summit earlier this week.
The minister cited only three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Kim Jae-in over the last five months and added: "If the parties to this ending issue are South Korea and not the US, the nuclear ending of the Korean peninsula will not find a stalemate."
However, the tone of Ri's speech differs dramatically from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that targeting the U.S. mainland with a North Korean rocket was unavoidable after Trump's "Mr. Evil President" named Kim as a rocket man" in a suicide mission.
Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his bravery in taking steps to deter weapons, but said much work still needs to be done and restrictions need to remain in place until North Korea ends its nuclear program.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time for this, saying "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argued that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council: "The Security Council's enforcement of restrictions must be continued with seriousness and without failure so that we feel the nuclear ending fully, definitively and verified."
The Security Council has voted to increase sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an effort to dismantle the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go smoothly.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, only for North Korea within hours after it had condemned him for making "gangster-like demands."
North Korea pledged in a meeting with Moon this month to unveil a guided missile site as well as a nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate steps."
He said Kim had told him that "the same measures" that Kim was looking for were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore and headed towards normal relations with Washington.
Harvard students have taken courses to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has provided all its students with more sleep in an effort to fight the growing learning culture through a caffeine-based ‘long night’.
A teacher finds students at the world's number one university often unable to understand the basics of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, provided a course he believed was the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a lecture on the effects of lack of sleep during learning.
“At the end of the course, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why am I just being told about this now, in my senior year?’
He said no one ever told him about the importance of sleep - and it surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course is introduced for the first time this year, explaining to students about the need for good sleep habits to help academic and sports performance, as well as improving their well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university's executive director of health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding its students lack sleep throughout the week.
The one-hour course involves several interactive assignments.
In one section, there is a bedroom image, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, coaches and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance is affected by lack of sleep, and the importance of sleep routines.
In other parts, participants were told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
"We know it won't change the student's behavior immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the health effects when choosing to smoke," added Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of pride in ‘watching all night’ still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students means lack of sleep is a growing problem.
Ensuring you have enough sleep quality, it should be a student's 'secret weapon' to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight gain, as a lack of sleep puts the brain in the insomnia mode, making it always hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after taking his class last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course has opened his eyes and inspired him to develop the course across the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduate students to complete the same learning program before joining a competitive institution.
Prof Czeisler suggests that students should consider using the alarm clock before and after sleep, and be aware of the hazards of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can damage your circadian rhythm from moving, causing sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga Goal kills Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another defeat at the opponent's place when Dolly Menga's net tied Steven Gerrard's weak team with a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team was still looking for the first win at the opponent's place since the 4-1 win at St Johnstone, but the Gary Holt team gave Gerrard a second defeat in 18 games as manager to cause his team to lose eight points behind the Ladbrokes Premiership league predecessor, Hearts.
Menga exploded in the seventh minute before the first half and the Rangers seemed to have no idea of equalizing the position.
With the Rangers now descending to sixth place, Livingston climbed to the third ladder and was just behind the Hibernian with a goal difference.
And the Rangers may be faced with problems again after the line guard, Calum Spence was forced to be treated for a head injury after being relocated objects from his troops' area.
Gerrard made eight swaps on his team who died to the final half of the Betfred Cup after defeating Ayr.
Holt keeps the same team as Livi 11 who stole one eye from Hearts last week and he's certainly happy with the way his team plays worrying their opponents at all times.
The Rangers may dominate the game but Livingston made more attempts on the goal.
They should have scored only two minutes later when Menga's first touch gave Scott Pittman space through Allan McGregor's goal but the midfielder was squeezed.
A free kick from behind Keaghan Jacobs meets captain Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow can only send the ball behind the goal.
The Rangers managed to regain control but he remained only hopeful in the last thirty minutes.
Alfredo Morelos felt he should have been given a penalty in the 45th minute when he and Steven Lawless got together but the judge Steven Thomson allowed the Colombian player's appeal.
The Rangers managed to give just two attempts in the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily smashed Lassana Coulibaly's fist and weak Ovie Ejaria's pair.
Although Livi's opening goal in the 34th minute may be contrary to the game's timing, no one can deny their chances.
The Rangers once again failed to cope with Jacobs' planned moves.
Scott Arfield was only stiff when Declan Gallagher pulled the ball to Scott Robinson who calmly sent to Menga for an easy finish.
Gerrard made a break-time exchange by swapping Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and he almost gave an immediate effect when the wing player gave the ball to Morelos but the amazing Kelly out of his area to block.
But Livingston continued to swap the opposing teams to play the game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett sending a far-flung shipment for a far-flung shipment.
Holt's forces were supposed to widen the gap in the final rounds but McGregor held well to deny Jacobs before Lithgow's kick was narrowed from the corner of the goal.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton asked for another penalty while he was in touch with Jacobs but Thomson once again didn't like him.
Almank: The creator of Geiger
And now, the page of our Almanach "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago on this day, and REMEMBER... the day the physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger created a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, the discovery that eventually led to a device known as PengiraGeiger.
As the main foundation of science since then, Kanter Geiger became the backbone of pop culture, as in the film "Bells of Coronado" in 1950, starring unknown scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is it?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger gerator, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
"When you use these earphones, you can actually hear the effects of atoms given by radioactivity in the minerals."
"Yeah, that sounds like it!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the creation that bears his name persists.
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system to 'see' bad cells
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system to 'see' evil cells and kill them
Vaccines teach the immune system to identify malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involved is to extract immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory.
It can "see" the protein that usually occurs to many cancer cells and is then re-injected.
The experimental vaccine shows encouraging outcomes for patients with various types of cancer.
A woman is treated with a vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, recovering from ovarian cancer after more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from patients, changing them in the lab so that they can "see" a common protein to many types of cancer called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our test results show that we have a very good vaccine."
HER2 "causes the growth of several types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, explains Prof Berzofsky.
The same approach to taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them how to target cancer cells has been successful in treating types of leukemia.
Kanye West participated in the Pro-Trump search, wearing a MAGA Hat, after his SNL appearance.
It's not accepted well.
Kanye West was mocked at the studio during Saturday Night Live after a great performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would compete in 2020.
After carrying his third song that night called Ghost Town where he wore a ‘Make America Great’ hat, he continued to oppose Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
"I often asked white people and they said, 'How can you support Trump, he's a racist?'
So, if I'm worried about change, I've moved from America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL began a performance with a sketch starring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star boasts of Brett Kavanaugh's recognition before the Senate Judiciary Committee of the allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it wasn't broadcast, Kanye West's footage was uploaded to social media by joke Chris Rock.
Not sure if Rock was trying to make fun of West with the message.
Also, West has complained to the audience that he had had had difficulty behind the scenes about his hat.
“They beat me behind the scenes.
They said, 'Don't go out there with that hat.'
They fucked me!
Then they say, I'm in a place that doesn't matter," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West added, "Do you want to see that unimportant position?" by saying that he would "wear my superman coat, because this means you can't lead me. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to love."
The comments he invited jokes at least twice from the audience and the SNL actors seemed embarrassed, Variety reports, with one there telling the publication: "The whole studio was silent."
West has been brought in as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, where her ex-boyfriend, singer Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West surprised many with the performance of the song I Love It, dressed as a Perrier Bottle.
West received support from TPUSA's conservative group leader, Candace Turner, who wrote: "To one of the most courageous people: LOVE FOR YOU IN CRITICAL RESPONSIBILITY."
But a call from the host of the talk show, Karen Hunter said West was just "being herself and it's really great."
"But I chose not to reward someone (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his "art") that I believe is accepting and sharing ideologies that are damaging to my community.
He's free.
We too," he added.
Prior to the performance, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he is now known as "the one who was formerly known as Kanye West."
He was not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, who was also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His friend, a rap singer, Snoop Dogg once changed his name to Snoop Lion and of course his song referred to legendary music, Prince, which changed his name to a symbol and later also as an artist previously known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder in a crash at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to attend the Belfast Magistrate Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington aims for toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his sword character Jon Snow in the HBO medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has taunted the stereotype of the hero maco, calling his character played on the screen means young people often feel like they need to be strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed "something was wrong" and questioned how to deal with the toxic masculinity problem in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Games of Thrones star Rose Leslie, also 31, admits she feels "very strong" about dealing with the issue.
"I feel a bit strong personally, at the moment - where are we wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What have we taught men as they grow up, in terms of the problems we see now?"
Kit believes television may be responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its highly masculine characters.
He added: "What is natural and what is taught?
What is taught on television, and on the streets, that makes boys feel they need to be men like this?
I think that's one of the important questions at the moment - how do we change it?
There's obviously something wrong with the young man right now."
In the talks, he also admitted that he will not set any pre-order or successor to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying he's already "completed with the battlefield and the horse".
In November, Kit will star in the remake of True West by Sam Shepard, the story of a filmmaker and his brother, a pirate.
The actor recently revealed that he considered meeting with his wife, Rose, the best thing that happened in Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this plan, so he gave me a future family and my life started from here," he said.
Rose carries the character Ygritte, the love of heart played by Kit, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple were married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estuary in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are infected in the country, health officials say.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most new cases are infected through sex, indicating a change than before.
In general, HIV spreads rapidly through parts of China as a result of contaminated blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a hearing in the Yunnan region.
However, year after year, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The spread of HIV through sex is a serious issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality is no longer a crime in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be growing.
Because of the country's conservative values, the study estimates that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Most of the spread of the disease is due to insufficient sexual protection in a relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies her staff leaked GOP senators' data, citing "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theory"
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced the allegations of an employee who had exposed the personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on the law-abiding Wikipedia site.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the claim had been disseminated by "ultra-right-wing" members and the website.
"Fraud, fraud and more serious fraud," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The distributed information reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, broadcast by an anonymous person at Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against potential Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The information leaked came after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported IP addresses identifying the cause of the shipment associated with Waters officials and disseminating Waters staff members' information, Hill said.
"These unsubstantiated accusations are false and one lie," Waters said again.
"My staff - where his identity, personal information, and security have been compromised due to these false accusations - is absolutely irrelevant to the leakage of this information.
These unsubstantiated allegations are completely false and in the form of fraud."
Waters' statement promptly invited online criticism, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This criticism is of an angry nature," Fleischer wrote.
"This shows that he doesn't want to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of doing something they don't do, they can't be angry.
They can't resist.
They can't question the motive of the accused.
They need to feel calm."
Fleischer said while comparing Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics who appeared too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who competed to kill Waters in the midterm election, also voiced his opinion on Twitter.
"It's great news if it's true," he whispered.
In fact, Waters said his official had informed "the relevant authorities and law enforcement entities of these false allegations.
"We will ensure the perpetrators will be exposed," he said, "and they will be responsible for all their actions that can destroy and harm any and all of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again Review - The Weak Risk Fraud of Rowan Atkinson
It is now common to look for signs of Brexit in any new film with a British snake and it seems to be used for the revival of Johnny English's action-comedy scam franchise - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is it a joke about how badly we become a new country's export opportunity?
Anyway, Johnny English, who likes to blink his eyes and face bored, has the opportunity to ruin the situation for the second time - the name of the sign that is more than anything else that he is an extensive comic creation designed for non-English-language film spectators.
He is of course a stupid secret agent who pretends to slow down glamour has the nature of Clouseau, a little Mr Bean and a musician who contributed a note to the theme song Chariots of Fire at the London 2012 Olympic Opening Ceremony.
He is also inspired by a mysterious international traveler and spy agent, Rowan Atkinson, who once appeared in Barclaycard's now-forgotten television ads, leaving chaos behind.
There's been one or two great times in J.J.'s latest movie.
I like Johnny English approaching a helicopter while wearing a medieval war uniform and a fan blade attached to his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is being shown, but the joke feels very weak and strange, especially "serious" films such as 007 and Mission Impossible now confidently offering comedy as their material.
The joke feels like it's highlighted for children rather than adults, and for me the accidental mistake of Johnny English is not to innovate and focus on the Atkinson films in Bean's persona.
The main premise is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has hacked into Britain's secret web network, revealing the identity of all British agents on the field and disappointing a duty agent - a very small character for Kevin Eldon.
It was the last chance for a proud and unpopular prime minister: Emma Thompson gave her best with this side character Teresa May but nothing good in the script for her character.
His intelligence adviser tells him every active spy has been compromised, and he needs to call someone out of retirement.
And that means Johnny English himself, who cooked and now works as a school teacher in some luxurious places, but provides an inappropriate lesson to become a secret agent: some good jokes here, as English offers spying science in academia like the School of Rock.
English was brought back to Whitehall for a brief moment of anxiety and reunited with his former assistant, Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a man who is already married, married to a submarine commander, a journalistic character carried by Vicki Pepperdine who is somewhat damaging.
So, the outstanding Batman and Robin in the Underground Secret Service of His Majesty, back in action against the beautiful seductive female character Ophelia Bulletova by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is being influenced by millions of charismatic techs who claim he can solve Britain's computer problem: Jason Volta is evil and played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their adventures with a small task: disguised as a waiter, lighting a fire and burning a French restaurant; hard-hittingly dragging himself into Volta's luxury cruise ship; and English sparks excitement when he tries to use the Mayan Reality headphones to get used to himself in Volta's home.
All the funny scenes are well taken for the last half, but because it looks friendly and slippery there's a bit of a taste like a children's television show about it.
It's a fairly simple film.
And like the other Johnny English movies, I was wondering: Couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a character that really fits his talent?
Nafi Labour Party plans for British people to work four days a week but be paid for five days
Labour Party chairman Jeremy Corbyn considered a radical plan that would see British citizens working four days a week – but paid for five days.
The party is reported to want the company's bosses to channel the savings made through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving them an additional day off.
He would watch the staff enjoy the weekend for three days - but still bring home the same salary.
The source said the idea was "fitting" with the party's economic agenda and plans to bring the country in favour of the workers.
Switching to work for four days a week is supported by the Labour Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of economic change.
A senior source from the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "The basic study is expected to be announced before the end of this year.
"It won't happen overnight but working for four days a week is an aspiration consistent with the party's approach to balancing the economy and favouring the workers as well as the entire party's industrial strategy."
The Labour Party was not the first to support the idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day working week in the 2017 election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not fully supported by the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day working week is not the basis of the party and it is not considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour conference last week by advancing his vision for the socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was reluctant to take power from the "faceless director" and "shooter" at utility firms.
The shadow chancellor's plan also meant that current shareholders in a water company may not be able to recover their entire shares because the Labour government could make a 'cut' based on the reason they were considered to be making a mistake.
He also confirmed plans to place employees in the company's board of directors and set up an Inclusive Ownership Fund to hand over 10 percent of the private sector firm's equity to employees, who will receive an annual dividend of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raised questions as to whether the bureau's findings could influence Republican senators to provide their support.
In a conversation broadcast on Sunday, 60 Minute reporters Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could find something that would cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy seems to be more open than his friend from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I told him I wanted to attend the trial, I said, I've been talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, which the charge appeared, and said, "Did you do it?"
He's strong, he's strong, he's clear."
In any case, Graham's vote has already been decided.
"I've already made the decision for Brett Kavanaugh and he's going to take heavy charges," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what's going on, but I know about this: Brett persistently denies it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone he calls can't confirm it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see any changes."
Is the World People's Party and Is It Doing Something to Reduce Poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the World People's Party, an annual music event that has an amazing line of stars and the same great mission; ending the world's poverty.
Now in the seventh year, the World People's Party will see tens of thousands gathered at Central Park's Big Site to not only watch shows like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the real goal of the event ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The World People's Party, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the World Poverty Project, an international support group aimed at eradicating poverty by increasing the number of people actively opposed it.
To receive a free ticket to this event (unless you are able to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors to this concert need to prepare some tasks, or "actions" such as being a volunteer, sending emails to world leaders, making phone calls or any other means that are meaningful to help raise awareness of their goals of eradicating poverty.
However, how far will the success of the world's people with the remaining 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of giving a free concert an honest way to persuade the public to demand something to do, or just another case of "clickivism" - making someone feel they've done something by just signing an online petition or by sending a call?
Since 2011, Global Citizens said they have recorded 19 million "actions" from its supporters, which urge movements with different goals.
They say these actions have helped encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than <0x24>37 billion that will bring change to more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group had identified 390 commitments and announcements resulting from their actions, and at least <0x24>10 billion of that amount had already been transferred or collected.
The group also estimates that the fund has been known to have impacted nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some important commitments include the Nutrition Force, a partnership between investors and UK-based agencies committed to "help children fully leverage their potential", promising to donate <0x24>35 million to Rwanda to help eliminate the imbalanced nutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 Go of cigarettes.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, federal governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make this unbalanced nutritional social injustice a past story in history," Minister of Nutrition Tracey Ullman said at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said after receiving more than 5,000 calls for the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government has preferred to fund a project, the Nutrition Power, which will now reach 5 million women and children in need.
Responding to one of the FAQs on his website, he asked, "What makes you think we can end severe poverty?"
Global Citizen has responded: "This is a difficult path and will take time - at times we will be disappointed and desperate.
But, just like the civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before, we will succeed, because when we cooperate we will grow stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the few artists who participated in the same performance at this year's show in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Navy as a "restriction" to prevent Russia from exporting oil
Washington could "if necessary" use its navy to prevent Russia from selling its oil on the market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zinke said in a Washington Examiner report.
Zinke claimed Russia's withdrawal from Syria - as it is known, involved themselves at the Syrian government's invitation - allegedly to search for a new oil market.
"I believe their presence in the Middle East is to dominate the oil supply as they have done in eastern Europe and southern Europe," he said.
And according to the officer, there is a way to address this issue.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure the naval route is open, and, if necessary, to prevent their oil from being marketed," he said.
Zinke said so when making a speech at a Consumer Energy Alliance incentive event, a non-profit group that labels itself as the "voice of oil users" in the US.
He also compared Washington's actions against Russia and Iran, and stressed the same.
"Options from an economic point of view over Iran and Russia are more or less the same, affecting and replacing oil," he said, referring to Russia as having no other choice and with its economy so dependent on oil.
The statement came out when the Trump administration was on a mission to increase natural gas exports to Europe that were far cheaper to consumers in Europe, replacing Russia.
That's why Trump officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "heavy side" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says will make Berlin backed by Moscow.
Moscow has said repeatedly that the <0x24>11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project will increase the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters and it is an economic project alone.
The Kremlin criticized Washington for dismissing the project so strongly because of economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I am sure that we agree that the energy supply should not be a weapon to pressure and users need to be free to choose," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said in a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US action has called for dissatisfaction by the German state, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organization, the German Industrial Federation (BDI), has called for the US not to interfere in the EU’s energy policy as well as on the agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our country's energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, the chairman of the German Industrial Federation (BDI) recently after a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will be "Kitchen Thinking" to compete as President in 2020, Massachusetts Senator said.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "think cooking" before becoming presidential candidate following a mid-term election.
When the answer was open to residents in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren said he would consider competing.
"It's time for a woman to go to Washington and fix our broken kingdom and this includes putting a woman on top of it," he said.
"After November 6, I will think with his cooking to be presidential candidate."
Warren expressed his concern about President Donald Trump when the answer was open, while saying that Trump "is driving our country in the wrong direction.
"I am concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren has criticized Trump for nominating Brett Kavanaugh as a federal court candidate.
In a statement on Friday, Warren said "we definitely need an FBI investigation before the lottery is made."
However, a review on Thursday showed that the majority of the population in the area represented by Warren felt Warren was not worth competing in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of voters in Massachusetts said the senator was not worth competing, according to a survey by the University Suffolk/Boston Globe Political Studies Center.
Thirty-two percent supported him.
The review also showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick to compete, with 38 percent supporting him potentially to compete and 48 percent disagreeing.
Other high-profile Democrats who are also discussed as potential to compete in 2020 are former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Biden said he would formally decide on it by January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin Measures Post-Traumatic Pressure Disorder (PTSD) Track Palin at Trump's Meeting
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the military in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my own child is facing, after returning home, I can feel the feelings of other families facing this PTSD problem and those home with injuries," he said at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said the detention of his son was "significant" and he said of his son as well as other war veterans as, "they're coming home differently, a bit hard and wondering if they'll be praised for their sacrifice to the country."
She was detained on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic violence against a woman, disturbing reports of domestic violence and having a gun when drunk, according to Dan Bennet, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, Washington supports boating against a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia supported to oppose one U.S. policy that prevents asylum to victims fleeing attacks by groups of violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and regions made a friend registration to the court on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who opposes this policy, NBC news reports.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. parallel session made by the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the federal policy has not yet been disclosed.
He said that his partner and "his son's violent group" had suffered from him but U.S. officials rejected his asylum application on July 20.
He was detained in Texas.
Prosecutors from the countries that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which have the highest number of asylum seekers in the United States, as a country filled with problems of malicious groups and domestic violence.
The new basis of the U.S. asylum application returns a decision made in 2014 in which the Immigrant Appeal Board has authorized immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, the District Attorney General of Columbia, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "does not undermine the state, federal and international laws that have existed for decades."
"The federal law requires all applications for asylum to be decided on the basis of the facts and circumstances leading to the application, and preventing it from violating the principle," the court said in a statement.
Prosecutors also disputed the policy that preventing immigrants from entering would deteriorate the U.S. economy by saying the prospect of these immigrants being entrepreneurs and "being the necessary workforce."
Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions has directed immigration judge to no longer provide asylum to the victims who fled for domestic violence crimes and for the violence of the malicious group in June.
Suaka will be given to those who leave their homeland for fear of being oppressed because of prejudice, religion, citizenship, or for joining certain social groups or holding different political grips," Sessions said when announcing this policy on June 11.
Suaka instead aims to solve all the problems -- even if all the problems are serious -- that everyone in the world faces every day.
Rescue work is increasing in Palu while death tolls are doubling
For those who survived, the situation was getting worse.
"It feels very depressed," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, who is breastfeeding her son with a fever in the city center of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance carries a corpse.
There's very little drinking water."
Residents seem to be stepping back into their abandoned homes, searching for their belongings in the water while trying to save as much as possible.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were damaged as a result of an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
Among the injured, including Dwi Haris who suffered a fracture of the spine and shoulder, rest outside Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outside as there was still a follow-up earthquake.
His tears flowed as he looked back as the earthquake shook the five-storey hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"Nothing to save us.
I'm stuck in a collapsed wall, it feels," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in the city to attend a wedding.
"I heard my wife's voice asking for help, then kept silent.
I don’t know what happened to my wife and son.
I hope they're safe.
U.S. ambassador accuses China of 'propaganda'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper aired a four-page advertisement in a U.S. newspaper that defamed the common good trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused China of using the U.S. newspaper to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China Daily paid ads in the Des Moines Register - the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in congressional elections on Nov. 6.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. election explains what U.S. officials report to Reuters as a new phase in the campaign to pressure China.
Being a common practice for foreign governments to broadcast ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now turning into a worsening trade war with each imposed tariffs on their imports.
China's initial action in this trade war is to target exporters in countries like Iowa that support the Republican Party represented by Trump, state experts say China and the US.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former Iowa governor, the largest exporter of agricultural goods to China, said the Beijing move has troubled many American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, according to Branstad in a press room in the Des Moines Register on Sunday wrote, "now more bullied by broadcasting propaganda advertisements in our own free press."
"In broadcasting this propaganda, the Chinese government accepts the freedom exercised by the United States, a tradition that prioritizes freedom of speech and freedom of the press," Branstad wrote.
"Conversely, in the Beijing newspaper, there is very little opposition and you can't see the people's real views on the Chinese country's economic goals that are worrying because their media is strictly controlled by the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He also added that "one of the main newspapers in China avoided an offer to publish" his article, although he did not state which newspaper.
Republican women's suffrage in midterm elections over Kavanaugh's story, an analyst warns
Although many renowned Republican members support and support Brett Kavanaugh's Federal Court of Appeals on sexual harassment charges, analysts warned they would invite responses specifically from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The high emotion covered this story and most Republicans stated in their record that they would continue with the vote.
Those things cannot be changed," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell Study Center, University of Syracuse, said in an article published Saturday in The Hill newspaper.
Reeher is not sure with the move of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to force the FBI to launch an investigation is enough to discourage angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and also in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the MoveOn progressive group on Friday, according to the Washington D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted "November is coming!" while pointing to feelings at the Senate building block when the Republican ruling Justice Committee chose to continue with Kavanaugh's nomination despite a testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic passion and motivation will explode," Stu Rothenberg, a free political analyst, told the news site.
"Many people say this is too high; it's true.
This may be higher especially for women voters who will vote from suburban areas and young voters, aged 18-29, they don't like this with the president and rarely vote.
Prior to Ford's public testimony that denounced allegations of sexual assault by a federal court, analysts thought it would take place if the Republicans continued with verification.
"This has been a very complicated thing for the GOP," Micheal Steela, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier last week, according to NBC news.
"It's not just a committee draw or a final draw or if Kavanaugh succeeds in becoming a federal judge, it's also about how the Republicans handle the issue and how they treat him," said Guy Cecil, director of the USA Priorities, a group that helped elect Democrats.
However, Americans seem to be divided into two and don't know who to trust in the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh with more than half in favor of Ford.
A recent YouGov survey showed 41 percent said they would believe or possibly believe Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they believed or perhaps believed Kavanaugh.
Meanwhile, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh might or should be lying in his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After being suppressed by Flake, the FBI is now investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one more allegations, reports Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian.
Last week, Ford made a sworn confession before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh had beaten him drunk when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez also said the Federal Court's candidate also showed his beating in front of Ford when a party while he was suing at Yale University around the 1980s.
The world's website creators plan to launch a new Internet network to compete with Google and Facebook
World Website creator Tim Berners-Lee launched a startup company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that uses open source software-based Solid creation Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and who will be entitled to access the information.
In an exclusive conversation with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the real purpose of Inrupt was "to dominate the world."
"We need to do this now," he said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own "personal online data storage" or POD.
It can contain contact lists, daily work lists, calendars, song lists and other personal professional accessories.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify that are available in one browser and simultaneously.
What is unique about the storage of data in this personal data is that it is entrusted to the user for who can access the type of information required.
The company calls it "personal control through data."
The inspiration for this Inrupt, according to its Chief Executive John Bruce, is to bring certain resources, processes and expertise to help the public enjoy Solid.
The company now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers staff hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer codewriters.
Starting this week, tech developers from all over the world can create their own free apps without centering at any location using the accessories found on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team hadn't had any talks with Facebook and Google to introduce or not introduce a single change in which all their business models would change immediately.
"We don't ask for their truth."
In a publication in Medium on Saturday, Bernes-Lee wrote, Inrupt, "his mission is to provide a single business and ecosystem power to help protect intergrits and the quality of new websites built using Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the world of the Internet when he founded the World Web Site Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the past few months, Berners-Lee has debated extensively about the need for a free-acting website.
While launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Website Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic for the new era of the website," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Recipient of the First World War of the Victoria Cross
The only priest from the Church of England who received the Victoria Cross award during World War I as a fighter was buried in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel Paderi Benard Vann who received this award on 29 September 1918 in attacks at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and did not immediately know that he had been awarded the highest prize of the British army.
A memorial stone was erected and opened by his two grandchildren at a rally in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was a "glorious symbol" because the stone would open the curtains 100 years since his grandfather's bold action.
According to the London Gazette newspaper, on September 29, 1918 Lieutenant Colonel Vann carried his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "which was filled with a thick fog and faced a great offensive.
He then flew to the border and with "extraordinary courage" and led him before flew using a gun alone and shot three men.
The lieutenant colonel was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - a month before the war ended.
Micheal Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something that is impossible I can repeat and so injure."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also put on a flower cup after the ceremony led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Pancaragam.
Micheal Vann said it was "very honoured to be a part of this movement" and added "true courage with the support that so many people have given."
MMA fans watch overnight to watch Bellator 206, instead they were given Peppa Pig
Imagine, you've been watching Bellator 206 all night but disappointed by watching the main show.
The San Jose list contains 13 matches, including six major matches that will be aired live every night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready to go, audiences in the UK were shocked when the broadcast switched to Peppa Pig's plan.
Some of them were angry because they stayed up all night to watch this match.
One of the fans said the exchange to the children's cartoon channel was "a non-convincing joke" through his call.
"The government's rules show the broadcast at 6 a.m. was not suitable for the match so they were forced to broadcast the broadcast to children," Bellator's vice president of marketing and communications, Dave Schwartz, said in a statement.
"Peppa is Khinzir, yes."
Bellator chairman Scott Coker said they were trying to reschedule the broadcast so that audiences in the UK could watch it.
"I think, when I'm talking about re-release, I think we can do something," Coker said.
“But at six o’clock on Sunday it is impossible for us to do anything until Sunday is our time, which is Monday is their time.
We're working on it.
Believe me, when the broadcast is exchanged, there are many text retransmissions and everything is not good to hear.
We're trying to solve this problem, we think it's a technical problem.
But no, it's more about the government.
I promise this won't happen in the future.
We're going to limit it to five matches instead of six - as usual - and we're trying to do something that can't be done for fans.
This is a poor situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels "self-reliant" against sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he grew up with low self-esteem due to his sexuality - but that's what motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old didn't realize anything until he went to high school and felt "not everyone like me."
Speaking for the first time on Radio 4 Desert Island Discs brought by Lauren Laverne, she spoke about the gay right to give "hope" to the others.
He also spoke after his father's title, he wasn't so keen on winning the Olympics.
The host remained in this long-released plan, Kris Young was on vacation for several months due to illness.
His sudden appearance in Laverne's first plan, Daley said he felt "less than" his peers when growing up because "he was not socially accepted as either a man or a woman."
"Until today, feeling less than others and feeling different from others is something that has pushed me and given me the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something" he said, so he didn't disappoint anyone when they found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medal winner is now a high-profile campaigner for the LBGT and has used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia so that more countries no longer make homosexuality a crime.
He said he spoke this because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without any problems and wanted to give "hope" to others like him.
The three-time world champion said the incident fell in love with a man - US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "wasn't immediately anticipated."
Daley married the Oscar winner who was 20 years older than her last year but said their age gap was never an issue.
"When you go through so much experience at such a young age" - he joined the first Olympics when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was very difficult to find someone in this age link who went through the same challenge.
The couple became a father in June to a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said "all the prospects" of his life have now changed.
"If you asked me last year, it's just about 'I need to win the gold medal'," he said.
"There's more to it than the Olympic gold medal.
"My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 when he was 40 years old after being diagnosed with a brain disease.
Daley said his father didn't want to accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if their London 2012 ticket had been bought - because he wanted to sit in front of him once.
“I don’t get to the heart to say ‘Daddy wouldn’t be there to sit on the front row’,” he said.
"I still hold my father's hand when he stops breathing and not until my father stops breathing and has just died I realize my father won't live forever," he said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I realize this is what I've dreamed of all my life - to jump in front of my fans in my own country in the Olympics, there's no other perception that can compare this," he said.
He also became a source of inspiration for his first song's choice - "Proud" by Heather Small - which invited him during the preparations for the Olympics and still made his Roman fur sneeze.

Mickelson is not ready to face the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American player Phil Mickelson will set a new record on Sunday when he plays for the 47th time in the Ryder Cup match, but he needs to be prepared to repay the game's performance so that it doesn't end in sadness.
Mickelson, who will play in this two-year event for a record 12 times, has been suspended by captain Jim Furyk for the game "fourballs" and "foursomes" on Saturday.
Instead of being a focus like a habit for the United States, the winners of these five main games spend time being a cheerleader and practicing in hopes of improving the quality of the game.
A person who can't hit the ball straight even when at the top of his game, this 48-year-old player is not the right choice for the Le Golf National golf course, where his distance is very difficult for a hit that doesn't meet the goal.
And if the golf course is just sweeping, Mickelson in the ninth game on Sunday will be in touch with British Open winner Francesco Molinari who has joined newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If an American player, a four-point loss starts with 12 single-player games, starts fiercely, then Mickelson's game is certainly very important.
Furyk is so confident with his players, that's all he can say.
"He understands his role today, and kicks his shoulder and puts his hand on my shoulder and says he will be ready by tomorrow," Furyk said.
"His self-confidence is very high.
He is well known and has contributed a lot of services to this team since then, and this week.
I may not have imagined he would play in two games.
I imagined more than that, but that's how and how we think we should do it.
He wants to be the same, like everyone else.
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for most appearances in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This may be the last time he will join the Ryder Cup that never matched his personal record achievements.
Mickelson won 18 times, lost 20 times and seven innings, although Furyk said his presence brought a single injection of passion to his team.
"He's funny, he likes to play, he likes to joke, he likes to wear people and it's fun to be in the team room," he said.
"I think all the young players are having fun with him, this week, and it's fun to see him.
He's not just playing, he's more than that.
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows their position ahead of them will slowly disappear.
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows from his experience that a far ahead position could be lost in the last day of the Ryder Cup and exacerbated the situation.
This Danish player first participated in the 1997 match at Valderrrama, where Seve Ballesteros drove as captain and preceded the American team with 5 points but was only able to win very thinly once with a score of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You're constantly reminding yourself after a leading position in Valderrama; we can also take a leading position in Brookline but we lose and in Valderram we win, but win thinly," Bjorn said after seeing Class 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and last night to be ahead with a score of 10-6 at National Golf.
So history will prove to me and everyone in the team that this game is not over yet.
We're going to have a fight tomorrow.
Go out and play seriously and don’t make mistakes.
It's not over as long as the eyes have not been picked up and floated on the stove.
We have a goal to win this trophy, and we will focus on that goal.
I've said, I'm going to focus on the 12 players in our team, but we all have to be aware of who our opponents are - they are the greatest players in the world.
So happy with his men's achievements on such a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I couldn't possibly be able to climb.
Tomorrow is a new day.
Tomorrow's individual achievements need to be melted and that's something different to do.
It's great to be out there with friends and when everything goes well but when you're alone then your full capacity as a golfer will be tested.
This is the message that all players need to hear, give the best in you tomorrow.
Now leave your friend and he needs to give his best in himself as well."
Contrary to Bjorn's view, his opponent Jim Furyk would hope his player would play well as an individual player compared to the team event, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who managed to get three points out of four.
Furyk himself once had experiences on the last day where the position changed, when he was in a team that was winning at Brookline before losing a surprise when the European team did "miracles in Medina."
"I still remember every fracture of words," he said when answering questions about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, burned the spirit of the player on the last day.
"We have 12 more shows tomorrow, but if you all want to start it as fast as you can see in Brookline, as you can see in Medina.
When the momentum starts, it will put pressure on the event in the middle.
"We're going to throw our players out on a schedule that we think is appropriate, we're going to try to do something great tomorrow.
Thomas has been given the assignment to fight back and clash with Rory McIlroy in the main event, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter European players who are in the top spots of the first part.
"I'm making this rule because I think it's going to stick and cover everything once in a while," Bjorn said of the individual player's choice.
Germany's new warship has been delayed.
The German navy is expected to receive its newest frigate ship in 2014 to replace the Cold War warship, but the ship will not be ready until next year due to system damage and rising costs, according to local media reports.
The launch of the warship "Rhineland-Pfalz", the first under the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate brand, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper citing a military spokesman.
The warship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, unfortunately after the regional problems hit the fate of this major project.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates ordered by the Navy in 2007 would replace the Bremen-class frigates.
It is understandable that it will contain features such as high-powered cannons, a variety of anti-ship and anti-ship fittings as well as some generosity features such as reducing radar detection, red light and acoustic capability.
Another important feature is the longer maintenance period - the newest frigate must be able to fly up to two years from its basement.
However, a number of obstacles mean this advanced warship, which is said to be capable of highlighting German power overseas - will be out of time by the time it joined naval service, according to Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate was the headline of last year's news, when German naval officers did not want to oversee the warship in and return it to the shipbuilding company Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned the ship to its builders after delivery.
Not much is known why the ship was returned, but German newspapers called some damage "operations and devices" making the warship useless if sent for combat missions.
Damage to the software had to be taken seriously as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class warship would be controlled by only 120 grades - half of what was needed to control the old Bremen-class frigate.
There are also issues where these warships are too heavy and this will reduce performance and limit the Navy's ability to make any future improvements.
The 7,000-tan Rhineland-Palatinate warship is believed to be twice as heavy as the warship in the same class used by the German army during World War II.
In addition to damage to the device, the overall cost of the project - including training for grades - also becomes an issue.
The project is said to have broken <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0x24>3.6bn) - up from its original price of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2bn Euro.
The recent frigate warships' problems show how lacking the German navy's capabilities are.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the defence committee in the parliament, acknowledged that the Navy was indeed facing the problem of the lack of capable warships.
The official also said the issue was getting worse, as the old warships that had been stopped did not get a replacement warship.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust is preparing for life
The latest study that is being conducted in an aesthetic in Scotland's highlands aims to explain why sharks use Earth's face shape to hunt for food.
It is expected that this study will lead to the latest findings regarding the unique mammalian behavior that is trying to fly this and can be a guide to conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the regular squirrel, and the soprano squirrels as well as the long-eared brown squirrel and Daubenton squirrel in the Inverewe Park in Wester Ross.
A special recording device will be placed in specific locations around the property to track floating activity throughout the season.
NHS workers and volunteers will also make mobile surveys using mobile tracking tools.
The expert analyzes the sounds of all recordings will identify the frequency of each species and its species and the actions of this species.
A single habitat map and report will be generated to create a scalable image of the Earth's surface with regard to floating behavior.
Rob Dewar, conservation adviser to NTS, hopes that the study's findings will show the most important habitat areas of the shrimp and the way it is used by each shrimp species.
This information will help identify the benefits of habitat management such as making peatlands and the best way to organize forests for sharks and other related species.
The number of squirrels in Scotland and the UK has been declining greatly over the last century.
Swarovski is threatened by building and construction work that disrupts the habitat and habitat loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lights are also a risk to squirrels the same as flies trap paper and some chemicals used to treat building materials as well as pet cat attacks.
In fact, the squirrel is not blind.
Because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use location tracking techniques using sound to identify insect positions and obstacles while in flight.
NTS is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 hectares of land across the country.
They have ten trained experts who often conduct surveys, check the response sites and sometimes save the squirrels.
The organization has also established one of Scotland's first shark conservation centers in Threave aesthetics in Dumfries and Galloway, which is where eight out of ten shark species in Scotland live.
David Thompson, the aesthetic manager, said this aesthetic is the most suitable place for velvet.
"We've got a very good place to go," he said.
"We have old buildings, many large trees and suitable habitats.
There's a lot more we don't know about squirrels, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand what squirrels need to live and thrive.
He stressed how important it is to carry out an inspection before starting maintenance work on the property because there is a possibility that we could accidentally destroy a shark nest that would contain sharks where this is capable of killing 400 female sharks and sharks, and possibly destroying the entire local shark population.
Squirrels are protected and are the mistake of killing, harassing or disturbing or destroying nest squirrels.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an officer for the Bat Conservation Trust encouraged the crowd to help.
He said: "There is still a lot of things we need to learn about butterflies and for many species we don't know how their populations are developing."
Ronaldo denies the allegations of bribery while his lawyer prepares to disguise the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo said the allegations were "fake news" and said people wanted to "promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyer will disguise the German magazine, Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus forwards were accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He was later said to have paid <0x24>375,000 to close the victim's mouth according to Der Spiegel's report on Friday.
Speaking in a live Instagram video to his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo denounced the report as "fake news."
"It's not true.
What they say today is fake news," the Ballon d'Or award winner told the camera.
“They want to promote themselves by using my name.
Get used to it.
They want to be famous by mentioning my name, this is part of my work.
"I'm happy and everything's fine," the player said with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to disguise De Spiegel on the allegations, which they call "an unfounded and disturbing private space," according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would demand compensation for "the moral damage that directly disturbs his personality, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The incident was reported to take place in June 2009 in a luxury hotel Palms and Casino room in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga were reportedly returned to the player's hotel room, where he was accused of crossing the woman unauthorizedly, according to an investigation paper registered at the Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claimed after the incident the player kneeled in front of him and said he was "99 percent" a "good man" and was only measured for "one percent."
The document confirms Ronaldo claims to have sex, but on the basis of likes equally likes.
Mayorga also claimed she made police reports and took pictures of the injuries she suffered while in the hospital, but later agreed to settle them out of court because she was "fearful of responses" and worried that she would be "disappointed by the public."
The 34-year-old woman now wants to cancel her previous solution because she is still traumatized by what has happened.
Ronaldo almost joined Real Madrid from Manchester when the charges took place, and this summer he has moved to Italian football giant Juve for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: UK 'will be forever sorry' for losing car manufacturer
The UK "will regret forever" if it loses its status as a world leader in car production after Brexit, said Commerce Secretary Greg Clark.
He added this was somewhat "concerning" as Toyota UK told the BBC if Britain leaves the European Union without a solution, it would stop production of its cars in Burnsaston, near Derby, for a while.
"We need a solution," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of this would result in shipping problems at the border if there was no solution to Brexit and this would lead to job losses.
The plant in Burnaston - which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis cars - installed nearly 150,000 car units last year, 90% of which were exported to other European Union countries.
"In my view, if Britain leaves the European Union without a solution by the end of March, we will stop production of cars at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's chief executive officer at Burnaston.
Several other car manufacturers in the UK including, Honda, BMW and Jaguar and Land Rover also said their concerns if the UK leaves the European Union without a solution on how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW said they would shut down their Mini car mill in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern of the car manufacturers is about the risk to the supply network if there is a Brexit without any solution.
Toyota's car production depends on the installation basis based on the receipt of supplies in a timely manner without the need to be stored with the car parts brought in to the factory every 37 minutes from the UK and the European Union average for the reserved cars.
If the UK leaves the European Union without a solution on March 29, it is likely that there will be a slump at the border that industry players predict will be suspended and a lack of spare parts.
Toyota is unlikely to be able to store inventory supplies for more than a day at the Derbyshire plant, the company said in a statement.
Mr Clark said the future plan of Finance Minister Theresa May for bilateral ties with the European Union "must be done with caution to avoid any checks at the borders."
"We need one solution. We want one solution that will allow not only success for the moment but for us to seize this opportunity," he told the BBC on Radio 4's Today program.
"The evidence not only from Toyota but also from these other manufacturers shows that we need to continue this very successful supply chain.
Toyota is unable to say how long its spending will be halted, but for the long term warns of rising costs and reducing the plant's competitiveness and consequently resulting in job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a member of the union responsible for the management of the union at the factory, said the union's experts have already begun to frustrate: "According to my experience, the lost job will not return.
A spokesman for the government said: "We have put forward an appropriate and strong plan for future relations between us and the European Union.
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, the White House says
A very important meeting between Donald Trump and deputy prosecutor Rod Rosenstein may be "rejected to next week" due to controversy over Brett Kavanaugh's nomination as a candidate for a federal court, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein, who oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigations, relates to Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump's assistants and Russia and possibly obstructing justice by the President.
Whether Trump will fire the prosecutor's deputy or not and subsequently interfere with Mueller's freedom to continue the investigation has become the hottest rumor in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported Rosenstein planned to use a secret recording tool to record his conversations with Trump and the possibility of replacing the president using an amendment to 25 constitutions.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday, he flew to the White House, behind a report that he said he would postpone his position.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump who was at the United Nations at the time in New York.
Trump said he was "unwilling" to fire Rosenstein but the meeting was postponed to avoid him merging with Kavanaugh's confession and Dr. Christine Blassey Ford one of the women who accused Kavanaugh of abusing him, before the Senate judiciary committee, which they both gave a confession.
On Friday, Trump directed the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, which had suspended a further full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The date has not been set yet, perhaps this week, I think it may be postponed for another week given some things that are happening in the federal court.
We'll see later, and I'll always give the latest information to the press.
Some reporters will argue: Sanders hasn’t held any White House press conference since September 10.
When Chris Wallace asks why.
Sanders said he didn't hold a lot of press conferences not because he didn't like TV reporters trying to "seek attention" but he also said: "I don't agree because they really want attention."
He said the relationship between the press and Trump will continue to grow.
"The president has held sessions on the most responses compared to the presidents before him," he said without providing any evidence. "We have made the calculations."
The press conference will continue to be held, Sanders said, but if the press had a chance to ask something directly to the president of the United States, it would be better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it more often, and you've seen we've been doing so a lot since last week and this will replace a press conference when you can speak directly to the president of the United States.
Trump often answers questions from newspapers when on his way out of the White House or when taking part in an open-ended response session or during a media conference with honorary guests.
A media conference in person is very rare.
This week in New York, the president showed why he sometimes made a free and bizarre appearance in front of the press gathering.
Health Secretary writes to European Union workers at the NHS about their concerns about Brexit
The secretary of state has written a letter to all European Union workers working at the NHS Scotland to express their gratitude to the country and hope that they will continue to work here after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP has sent a letter of intent less than six months before the UK left the European Union.
The Scottish government has also committed to cover the costs of applying for citizens of the European Union working in its public sector.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union on the resignation have continued, and are headed to reach a decision by the autumn.
But the UK government has increased its preparations to face one unsolved scenario.
I know this is something that really worries you all.
That's why I want to emphasize how much I appreciate the contributions of each of you, regardless of your nationality.
Employees from across the European Union and other countries, bring together a wealth of experience and expertise that strengthens and improves health services and provides benefits to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is the home of all of you and we want you all to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after having suffered a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after having suffered a head injury after losing 31-27 to Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ from Tennessee reported.
Coach Rod Reed told reporters the incident took place just before the second half.
"He was near the edge and suddenly fell there," Reed said.
Coaches and health workers gave Abercrombie oxygen there before putting her in a trench and taking her for further treatment.
An official from Tennessee State told Chirs Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had completed surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added "there is no information on the type/how far the injury is currently" and Tennessee State is trying to determine if the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a first-year red suit prosecutor, played in the first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had already made five firings on Saturday before leaving the game, the number of firings this season was 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher seam allowance when they purchase property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher set-up fee when they buy property in the UK and this surplus money will be used to help loans under the latest Tory plan.
This step will reveal Corbyn's success to attract young voters
This tax will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
Treasury is expected to quote up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year - to help empty
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher setback when they buy property in the UK - money from this will be used to help the leak, Theresa May said today.
This move seems to disprove Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young voters by promising to provide capable housing and make high-income people a target.
Increased tax rates will be imposed on individuals and firms that don't pay taxes in the UK, money from these results will help the government address the problems of people who don't have a home.
This supplement - is an addition to the stamped duty that has already been imposed including the higher duty that has been introduced two years ago on the second house and the house purchased for rent that may be three percent.
Treasury is expected to be able to collect up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year through this step.
It is estimated that 13 percent of London's new properties are bought by non-UK citizens, causing prices to bloom and swap those who want to buy their first home.
Most luxury areas - especially in the country's capital - have become "the desert" because many of its owners are the owners of foreigners who spend a lot of time abroad.
The new policy was just announced a few weeks after Boris Johson demanded that the set-up be reduced so that more young people could buy their first home.
He accused the large construction company of deliberately maintaining the high price of property by buying land but not developing it, and said May was able to remove the quota on the house to deal with Britain's "shameful housing problems."
Mr. Corbyn has announced several series of interesting housing renovation proposals, including rent control and abolishing "innocent" expulsion.
He also wanted more power to be given to members of the council to build a new house.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I will dedicate my term as Prime Minister to restore the British dream - this life must be better for every generation to come.
And that means improving our poor housing market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and build life here.
However, it's unfair because it's very easy for individuals who don't live in the UK, as well as companies that are renegade overseas to buy homes compared to the British people who work hard here.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is so far away, and the fact of living in an equal place with a humiliation is a reality.
Jack Ross: ‘My main goal is to manage Scotland’
Sunderland boss Jack Rosa said his "primary goal" was to become Scotland's manager sometime later.
The 42-year-old Scottish is awaiting a challenging opportunity to re-establish the North-East club that is on the third ladder in the League One, less than three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after bringing St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I want to represent the country as a player.
I got a call for B cap and so far," Ross told BBC Scotland Sportssound.
"I grew up seeing Scotland in Hampden with my father when I was a kid, and there was something that always attracted me there.
The chances will come only if I succeed as a manager at the club level.
Ross' successors as managers of Sunderland included Dick Advocaat, Dovid Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neil, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athetic manager said he didn't feel like he was following such a famous name in the big clubs, as he had previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town's applications.
“For me, success at this point is: ‘Can I bring this club back into the Premier League?
"Because of the structure and facilities in this club, it should be in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to achieve, but I'd think I'd be successful if I could bring this club back into the Premier League."
Ross was new for three years in management, after becoming an assistant manager at Dumbarton and being one of the coaches at Hearts' for 15 months.
He then helped Alloa return to stage three after he was relegated and changed St Mirren's fate from being relegated to Champion in the following season.
And Ross said he was very comfortable now compared to being a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It's an option," he recalled, as he ran the Alloa.
"I know that the game is better than playing with me.
Maybe it sounds strange because I succeeded, can live happy and enjoy some exciting times.
Playing is a little hard.
There are a lot of things you need to spend every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of pressure and urge work as a player but as a manager I'm more comfortable.
I've always wanted to take care of it and now I'm doing it, and I feel comfortable doing something that I like throughout my adult life."

The best time to drink beer is at 5.30pm on Saturday, according to a study.
This summer's summer heatwave led to British pubs facing problems but a series of restaurants were under pressure.
Groups of pubs and bars showed a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July - but in restaurants it fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of CGA's business consultancy firm that collects these figures, said: "The ongoing heat and the longer England World Cup campaign means July will follow the pattern of June, where pubs rose 2.8 percent, except for restaurants falling worse.
The decline of 1.8 percent in restaurants in June worsened in July.
The performance of a pub that prioritizes drinks and bars is very strong compared to a declining restaurant.
The pub that prioritizes food also suffers bad luck as a result of hot weather, but not as bad as the restaurant operators.
Most people just want to go out for a beer.
Pubs and bars recorded a 6.6 percent increase in sales for the month, while food was down 3%.
Paul Newman, RSM's entertainment and food analyst, said: "This decision seems to be the same and has been ongoing since the end of April.
The weather and social events or sports events are still a major factor in the increase in sales in the market outside the home.
Unsurprisingly, the group of restaurants continues to shrink, sales drop by 4.8 percent if compared to year-to-year is likely to be worse with cost pressures again.
The long summer summer weather hits restaurant operators in bad weather and only time will determine if the colder weather as we experience in August will bring relief."
The number of increases in sales in pubs and restaurants, including the new ones being opened, is 2.7 percent in July showing moisture in the newly introduced brand.
Observers for the sales sector at UK pub, bar and restaurant The Coffer Peach Tracker collects and analyzes data performance from 47 groups operating at a <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion turnover is an industry benchmark.
One in five children has a social media account that they've signed up for from their parents.
One in five children - some just 11 years old - have a secret social media account they've stolen from parents and teachers, according to a survey.
A survey of more than 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the page "Fake Insta"
The news further increases the risk of sexual content being transmitted through it.
Twenty percent of students say they have one "first" account to show to their parents.
One in five children - some are just 11 years old - open social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of over 20,000 high school students showed a sudden increase in the "fake Insta" account - a reference to the Instagram image-sharing page.
This increases the risk of sexual content being transmitted through it.
Twenty percent of students say they use a clean “primary” account to show to their parents, while having one personal account.
A mother who found the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter urged the public to "shoot me."
A study by the UK Digital Awareness and the Great Teachers Conference (HCM) free schools found that 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, with more than half of them admitting they had private accounts.
HCM chairman Mike Buchanan said: "It's worrying to see so many teens trapped creating an online space where parents and teachers can't track them."
Eilidh Doyle will be a "voice to athlete" in Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle was appointed to the Scottish Athletics Institute as non-executive director during the summit of the governing body.
Doyle is a respected Scottish racing athlete and chairman Ian Beattie explains this step is an opportunity for those leading the sport to benefit from Doyle who has had a lot of international experience for more than a decade.
"Ilidh is very popular in Scotland, the UK and the international community of athletes and we are sure the athletes in Scotland will benefit greatly from his participation in this institution," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I want to be the voice of all athletes and I hope to contribute and help guide this sport in Scotland.
The American athlete who once won the gold medals for the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta now owns four Olympic gold medals and now makes cover for the BBC, after being unable to walk due to a transient ischemic attack.
He said: "I had a stroke last month.
I can't walk.
The doctor says only time can determine to what degree I can recover.
It's not as easy to be as it used to be, I need to learn to walk again and today I need to make an intelligence exercise!
Thank you for all your support!"
Mother's milk pump ads that make comparisons with cows bring conflicting opinions online
A mother's milk pump company gets a variety of controversial opinions online because their ads compare breastfeeding mothers with cows being bred for milk.
To launch what is said to be "the world's first silent and wearable breast milk pump," consumer technology company Elvie released a joke-shaped music video to show the freedom that mothers who use the new pump can feel.
Four mothers danced in a straw-filled cow's wardrobe to a song where the lyrics read: "Yes, I am my own milk pump, but you can't see any tail" and "if you don't realize this is not a breast, this is my breast."
He said, "I'm going out, I'm going out, I'm going out, I'm going out, I'm going out, I'm going out, I'm going out."
However, these ads published on the company's Facebook page have sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views, and hundreds of comments, the video has invited a wide range of reactions from the general public, many who say it gives a cheerful picture of the dairy industry that is "starting."
"It's an unreasonable decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, cows need to bunt and have to give birth to babies to produce milk, but unfortunately cows are separated from cow mothers within a few days of their birth," said one author.

Another commented: "It's a trauma for cows and cows.
"But what about using them to advertise a milk pump for a mother who can keep their children?"
Another added: "An advertisement that doesn't have to be displayed directly."
Others maintained the ad, with a woman admitting that she found the song "very heartbroken."
"I think it's a genius idea.
I would buy one if I still gave milk.
It makes me feel like a cow.
The ads are a bit crazy, but I think it's the way it is.
"It's a genius product," he wrote.
Another commented: "This is a funny ad that is aimed at moms who stamp (usually at work or in the toilet) and feel like "cows."
This is not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they have all been dancing with a pump hidden in their clothes.
The concept behind this campaign is based on the response that most lactating women say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and can be hiddenly loaded in dresses, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and also out during the clamping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother commented: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product, it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By equating women who chew cows, we want to put body milk packaging and all the challenges associated with it as the main focus, while showing a way of entertaining and connecting with feeling free through the use of new pumps.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has been headlined.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared on stage for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of children migrated quietly to campsite on Texas border.
The number of migrants detained has increased even though the monthly border transfers have not changed much, due to the heavy rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration, making it increasingly difficult to place children with guarantors.
According to tradition, insurers are undocumented immigrants, and they are afraid to affect their positions to continue living in the country if they take a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that insurers and other adult members of the family would need to hand over their fingerprints, and the data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, the chief official of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified in front of Congress that the agency had detained dozens of individuals who had applied to be guarantors of childless children.
The agency confirmed that 70 percent of those detained had no previous criminal records.
"Almost 80 percent of individuals, whether insured or family members of the insured, are here illegally and most of them are unauthorized immigrants.
With that, we will continue to hunt the individual,” Albence said.
In order to process children more quickly, the authorities introduced new regulations requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, not after 60 days according to the previous standard, according to protection workers.
Many will be present through video-conference calls, rather than personally, to summon their case to a legitimate position before an immigration judge.
Those who are deemed unworthy of assistance will be deported immediately.
The longer the children are under detention, they are more likely to become anxious or shy, and this will lead to coal-fired actions or attempts to escape, according to security officials and according to reports issued by the system in recent months.
Supporters said the concern was higher in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where signs that children struggle with feelings might not be detected, due to the size of the place.
They add that by relocating children to campsites without providing time for them to be emotionally ready, or saying goodbye to friends may make the trauma they face worse.
Syria's U.S., French and Turkish troops retreat immediately
Speaking at the United Nations General Conference, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem urged Syrian refugees to return, despite the war in the country having reached its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign troops on Syrian soil under the anti-terrorist regime "will take appropriate action."
"They have to retreat immediately and unconditionally," he said.
Moualem stressed that "the war on terrorism has ended" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions more have lost their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this holy war until we wipe out Syria" from both violent groups and "any foreign occupation".
The United States has 2,000 troops in Syria, specially for training and advising the Kurdish and Arab Syrian soldiers against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground of the war-torn country.
Regarding the refugee issue, Moualem said the situation was appropriate for them to return, and he accused "outsiders" of "spreading irrational fears" that led to the return of the refugees.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help this return," he said.
"They're politicizing the thing that should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be given reconstruction aid until a political agreement is concluded between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The U.N. diplomats said the agreement between Russia and Turkey to provide a military-free zone in the Idlib-held region has created opportunities to continue political planning.
The Russian-Turkish talks have diverted a major attack by the Russian-backed Syrian army in the region where three million people live.
Moualem, however, said the agreement had a "real time limit" and expected military action to target jihadists including rebels from the Nusra Front associated with al-Qaeda, which "will be eliminated."
UN special envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to arrange a first meeting for the new committee, which includes the government and opposition members to pave the way for post-war elections.
Moualem stated the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "checking current constitutional articles," and warning against disruption.
Trump will win the second round.
With that logic, Trump will win a re-election in 2020, unless, as expected by liberal observers, the charges of dismissal and scandal put an end to his presidential term ahead of time.
In an undeniable situation as "The most dramatic finale for a presidential term!"
At the moment, there are no signs of loss.
Since 2014, premier time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average premiere viewership of 2.4 million, an additional of 1.7 million, four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" aired ahead of the cable rating, up to 3.5 million viewers on the night of the premiere.
"This is a fire that attracts people's attention because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, the director of ABC's "Designated Survivor," a story about the cabinet secretary who became president after the attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
He recalled a taxi ride before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? he asked.
"He said, 'Because he made me laugh,'" Mrs. Scovell told me.
There is value in entertainment.
True, unlike on TV, the story path from Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether a family of immigrants could reunite or global economic health.
Not following the development is just a pleasure for a lucky audience.
However, it's far from being a knowledgeable citizen when you find you're watching a panel of experts arguing about the use of a 'deep background' by Bob Woodward's in search of a source for his book "Fear," the Trump bomber's jacket sensing the camels about <0x24>15,000 Paul Manafort's post, and the stormy to Daniel's magnificence.
I will never see Super Mario again with the same view.
"Part of what he's doing looks like in a reality show that looks like he's preparing you for something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and "Pawn Stars," about Trump's story with actors' exchange and daily plot swaps (starting a fight with N.F.L.), adding:
You can't miss an episode or you'll miss it.
When I visited Fleiss this week, the weather outside his home north of Kauai was bright 80 degrees, but he was stuck in the house watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He should not leave the TV, not when Brett Kavanaugh was appointed to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court is still uncertain.
"I remember when we made a crazy performance and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of the Western Civilization,'" Fleiss told me.
"I think it's a joke, but it's true."

External money flooded into a fierce mid-election council match
It's no surprise that the election to 17 Pennsylvania showed a flood of money, given the re-establishment of the congress area showing two prosecutors are now competing for the same seat.
The re-painted suburban area of Pittsburgh rivals Democratic representative Conor Lamb - who won his seat in the special election of the previous spring.
Lamb competed against another now-official, Republican deputy Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th Pennyslvania area, which is in line with the new 17th.
The map was re-painted when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old area had been demolished alongside the Republicans.
The new 17th innings have started a fierce financial campaign match between the party's main financial machinery of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a common name heard in Pennsylvania after a thin victory in a special March election for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania which was crowded.
The seat has been won by Republicans for a decade, and President Donald Trump won the area by 20 points.
Politically intelligent people have given the Democrats an advantage.
U.S. Plans to Punish El Salvador For Supporting China, Then Retreat
The diplomats of the Dominican Republic and Panama have recognized Beijing, with a slight negative response from Washington.
Trump held a meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela, Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partner expelled the Trump Organization's management team.
Government officials have decided to recall the head of U.S. diplomatic delegations from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "the latest decision not to recognize Taiwan," Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the department, said in a statement earlier this month.
But the fine was only imposed on the density of El Salvador, which received a <0x24>140 million budget in US aid in 2017, including drug control and economic support.
The proposed fines, including cuts to financial aid and visa waivers, would have a negative impact on the Central American country with high rates of unemployment and murder.
After an internal meeting was held, North and Central American officials suspended a high-level conference focusing on economic security and prosperity, for a follow-up to a similar meeting last year that appeared to be a positive step in preventing immigrants from moving to the United States.
But in mid-September, top administration officials decided they wanted the trial to continue, effectively stopping any considerations to punish El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence will now give a speech at the summit, scheduled for mid-October, as an import signal where the administration is in the meeting, according to the diplomat.
And the three U.S. representatives returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no strong messages or fines from Washington.
White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats who had agreed to discuss internal considerations on condition of independence.
Their statements are supported by external analysts who are close to the administration and also speak on condition of tolerance.
Historical Studies
What will happen next may be Robert Mueller's special lawyer's report on Trump's possible obstruction of justice, which now has strong evidence in the public record.
Mueller will also launch an investigation to investigate whether Trump's campaign has joined Russia in an attack on our election.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will face responsibility for the party, as soon as he is ready to face the voters, and perhaps eventually a jury containing his equivalent.
It's all if, and I'm not saying that Trump's fall will definitely happen - or people like him in Europe.
There are choices to be made by all of us on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an impact on how long this wreckage lasts.
In 1938, German officials were willing to make an attempt to seize power against Hitler, if the West did not follow Hitler and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We have failed, and we have missed the opportunity to avoid the brutal murders that took place over the next few years.
The journey of history revolves around such an inflection point, and the journey of unhindered democracy will be accelerated or delayed.
The American people are facing some of these points of inflection right now.
What would we do if Trump fired Assistant Attorney Rod Rosenstein, the person in charge of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has had problems since the newspaper reported that, in the past year, he had planned to make the president's footage and make speculation that the president was not eligible for the position.
Rosenstein said the Times statement was inaccurate.
"How will we act if the FBI's new investigation request against Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair - or if he is verified to the Agong Court even though there are real allegations of sexual assault and evidence of fraud?
And more importantly, are we going to vote for the deputy Congressman whom Trump will be responsible for?
If we fail in the test, democracy will go through a long winter.
But I think we won't fail, because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was of Czechoslovak Jewish descent who had been expelled to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had conquered my embassy.
He survived, moved to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light a Sabbath candle on a swastika table.
With that as my legacy, how am I not optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of Rangers optimistic about the battle with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory against Austria, following a series with Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, would put them in a strong position to qualify them in Group G in the European League.
The knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his debut this season to a 2-2 series with Villarreal, but he believed the Rangers used this decision as a leap for a great win.
"It's a good point because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We played in this game with the belief that we would get something and we've got one eye.
We might win at the end of the match, but the series might be a more fair result.
They may have played better in the first half and we played better in the second half and in the better side.
On Thursday, another great European night.
We hope we have three points but the game is difficult because they have made a good decision in the previous game but, the audience supports us, I'm sure we will play well and get a positive result.
Last year was really hard, among all the things that happened with my injury, and the exchange in the club but there are fun factors about this place right now.
Good squads and the teams feel fun; the training is also good.
We hope we can do our best, leave last season and succeed."
Women can't sleep due to the lack of sleep.
While the participants' reviews have a clear idea of how they want to be maintained, some have even talked to their family members about it.
Half of the induvids in a nationwide study stated that they had discussed with their partner about the cost of long-term maintenance.
Only 10 percent of children talk to their children about it.
"They want family members to keep them but don't take steps to talk," said Holly Snyder, the nation's vice president of insurance business.
Here's how to get started.
Talk to your partner and child: You won't be able to provide a family to provide care for you if you don't tell them in advance.
Working with your counselor and your family to discuss the place and how to get care, as those choices will be an important factor in knowing the cost.
Bring your financial advisors: Your advisors can also help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
Funds for long-term care can include traditional long-term care insurance policies, one hybrid cash-value life insurance policies to help protect these expenses or self-insurance with your wealth - as long as you have money.
Complete your legal document: Complete the legal war at the same time.
Set a health care representative in place so that you can appoint an individual you trust to supervise your health care and ensure a professional expert according to your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also consider the authorization letter for your finances.
You'll choose the person you trust to make a decision for you and make sure your bill is paid if you don't try.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine your parents have a medical emergency and are on their way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about drugs and allergies?
Explain these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
"It's not just the money set, but who's the doctor?" asked Martin.
"It's a medicine?
Who will take care of the dog?
Set up a plan."

Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by the earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to authorities, the death toll is expected to increase.
In the absence of a communication system, the authorities were unable to obtain information from the government of Donggala, the northern region of Palu adjacent to the earthquake center with a magnitude 7.5 magnitude vibration.
In Palu more than 16,000 people have been displaced after the disaster occurred.
Here are the main facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi region, located at the end of the narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city is celebrating the 40th anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a 300 km (180 mi) government area on the northwest coast of Sulawesi Island.
The settlement area, an administrative region under the region, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming became the economic backbone of the Central Sulawesi region, especially in the waters of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the region, but is concentrated only in Morowali, on the beach opposite Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by Tsumani several times in 100 years, according to Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
The tsunami also struck west of Donggala in 1996, killing 9 people.
Indonesia is seismicly located in the Pacific Fire Circle and has always been hit by an earthquake.
Here are the main earthquakes and tsunami in the last few years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Acheh region, Indonesia in northern Sumatra on 26 Dec has triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the waters of the Indian Ocean, half of which in Aceh.
2005: A series of earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds were killed on Nias Island on the Sumatra beach.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 struck near Padang City, the capital of the Western Sumatra region.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake hits one of the Mentaui Islands, in Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed 300 people.
2016: A moderate earthquake hits the Pidie Jaya government area in Acheh, causing destruction and panic, reminding residents of the major devastation events of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami was triggered at the time, but more than 100 were killed due to the collapse of the building.
2018: A powerful earthquake struck Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, especially in the northern part of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded at the time.
Sarah Palin's son-in-law arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the son-in-law of former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, has been detained on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was detained, suspected of carrying out domestic attacks, disturbing reports of domestic violence crimes and opposing detention, according to reports released on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to police reports, while a woman's friend was trying to make a police call to report the crime, she had taken the phone from the woman.
Palin was detained at the Mat-Su pre-talk facility and was detained with an unpaid bond of <0x24>500, KTUU reports.
He was faced in court on Saturday, where he had claimed "certainly, innocent" when asked about the confession, the network reported.
Palin faced three minor Class A mistakes, meaning he would probably be imprisoned for up to a year and fined <0x24>250,000.
He has also been charged under a small Class B error, can be punished for a day in prison and a fine of <0x24>2,000.
This is not the first time a criminal charge has been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, the girl was accused of attacking her father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the allegations of the attack.
This case is referred to the Alaska Military Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic attacks, disturbing reports of domestic violence crimes and having weapons in a drunken state related to the incident.
Palin's girlfriend accused the man of hitting his face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by a group of veteran soldiers in 2016 after linking her son's violent actions with PTSD following her service in Iraq.
Tsunami earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake hit Indonesia's island of Sulawesi on Friday.
An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are also affected by the death toll expected to increase in the next day.
Earthquakes hit outside Sulawesi Central, located northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulated on social media showed at the time of the event.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach to celebrate a party in the city of Palu during a tsunami that struck the beach.
Prosecutors demand extraordinary death sentence for suspected NYC violence attack
New York prosecutors are demanding the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, New York City suspected of a violent attack that killed eight people -- an extraordinary punishment that has not been carried out in the state of federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, was accused of using a rented Home Depot truck to carry out an attack on a bicycle path along the West Bank Highway in Lower Manhattan, stabbing pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors need to prove that Saipov "intended" to kill the eight victims and "intended" to carry serious bodily injuries, according to the notice with the intention of demanding the death penalty, in a file in Southern District, New York.
Both charges led to the death penalty, according to court documents.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal supreme jury has charged Saipov with 22 charges including eight counts of murder caused by illegal activities, which are always used by prosecutors in a planned crime case, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack requires "meticulous planning and planning", according to the prosecution, describing how Saipov carried out the action as "gentle, cruel and contemptuous."
"Sayfullo Habibulaevic Saipov has caused injury, pain, and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco."
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a long time since the Southern District of New York has filed a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, has been accused of killing two drug dealers but has finally been sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was imposed for New York's federal case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, the couple's husband who had been sentenced after they were sentenced to carry out espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenberg had been sentenced to death using an electric chair on 19 June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, did not feel guilty on the day and month after the attack, according to court documents.
He made it clear to the investigator that he was happy with what he was doing, according to the police.
Saipov told him he was pushed to carry out the attack after watching ISIS video on the phone, according to the allegations.
He also asked to display the ISIS flag in the hospital room, according to police.
He said he was innocent of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal martial lawyers representing Saipov, said they were "really disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
"We feel the decision to prosecute the death penalty rather than accepting guilty confessions for life imprisonment with no possibility of being released, only extending the trauma of this event to all those involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense earlier requested that prosecutors not demand the death penalty.
According to Tory MP, Nigel Farage should be responsible for conducting Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage called for "moving the people's army" today during a protest at the Tory trial.
Former Ukip chairman said politicians need to "feel the spark" of "Eurosceptics" - because one of the MPs, Theresa May, suggested she should be given the responsibility of controlling negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told a speech in Birmingham that the UK would "go out now" if Farage became Brexit secretary.
But the challenge May faced was to resolve the split between members who supported the Remain Tories member who joined the opposition to the city's Brexit.
The prime minister is trying to ensure that the Chequers backlash plan remains in place amid attacks from Brexiteer, Remain and the EU.
The Allied party insisted May was negotiating with Brussels despite the effects facing - and the power of Eurosceptic and Labour to choose between his package or "chaos."
Bone told the Exit meeting what it means to go out in Solihull who wants to "discard the Chequers."
He recommended Farage to be made noble and was given the responsibility of negotiating with Brussels.
"If he's given that responsibility, we're out now," he said.
Wellingborough MPs added: "I support Brexit but we must remove the Chequers."
Setting up a protest against the EU, he said: "We do not fight in a world war to become slaves.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone rejected the suggestion that public opinion had changed since the 2016 lottery: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and want to remain is not at all true."
Brexit Tory supporter Andrea Jenkyns, who also attended the rally, told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the voice of the people.
"Chequers are not popular among the public, the Opposition will not vote in favour, it is not popular in our party and the activists who are on the streets and who have voted for us.
Please drop the chequers and start listening."
In a message addressed to May, he added: "The prime minister will continue to hold their posts if they keep their promises."
Farage said politicians need to "feel embarrassment" if they want to betray the decisions made in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is the trust between us - the people - and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here to tell them 'we won't allow them to leave by doing so.'
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: "I want you to make our political class, who is almost betraying Brexit, feel its impact.
“We are preparing a people’s army that gives us victory in Bexit and will not rest until we make the United Kingdom free, have its own government, proud.”
Meanwhile, Remainer traveled through Birmingham before holding a gathering in the city center.
Serum activists spread the Tories flag Against Brexit following the group's launch at the end of the week.
Peer Labour Lord Adonis ridiculed the Conservatives about the security issues they faced with party applications during the trial began.
"They said they could have IT systems in place and all technology with Canada and so on, for borders without conflict, for trade without borders," he added.
"It's all rumors.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to "study" to compete for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "study to compete for the presidency" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that a Massachusetts Democrat presented plans for his future at a town hall in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a harsh critic of President Donald Trump, is competing for re-election in November with GOP state rep candidate Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired the Massachusetts Trump campaign in 2016.
He is expected to compete with Trump in 2020.
Saturday's noon in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with users using the 'town hall' format since Trump took office.
One of the participants asked if he wanted to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time "for women to go to Washington to repair a corrupt kingdom, and this includes a woman on the top ladder."
Arrests made in the death of the Sims from LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that a suspect had been detained in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the detention of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET news conference.
They had streamed a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify the man seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, had been shot and killed near Southern University campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to his head and was eventually killed as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, via 247sports.
Wayde acts to defend his friend and is shot by Simpson.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closes the gap in the world championship when the team orders him to win, killing Sebastian Vettel
It is clear that at that time, Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday," Mercedes's team's instructions played an important role in this race.
From the start of the squad, Bottas started well, almost defeating Hamilton while defending his position in the first two rounds and inviting Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel entered the pit first and left Hamilton in traffic at the end of the group, something that should be final.
Mercedes then went into the pit in the next round and out behind Vettel, but Hamilton then made a tire-to- tire action that made Ferrari drivers leave the inside free above the risk to defend themselves after the action defending the third angle.
Max Verstappen started from the back grid and was in seventh place after the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then went ahead for most of the race and did not change tires to target a quick finish and crossed Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He managed to get into the pit in the 44th round but couldn't speed up for the next eight rounds when Raikkonen was in fourth place.
A difficult day for Valtteri who has made a good race throughout the weekend and is a wake-up caller nature allowed me to cross.
The team has done a great job of winning first and second place," Hamilton said.
That's not a good language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday for urging women that she did not leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford to accuse Ang Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not respond directly to the testimony given before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what happened in the Senate showed people "horrible and ugly and liars."
"One thing that can happen and a wonderful thing that happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and cruel and ugly and liars," he said.
"When you look at the exposure and leakage and they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, you leaked?
Remember the answer... did you leak the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I'm not leaking."
All right, wait a minute.
Are we leaking... No, we are not leaking," he added, expressing the senator's face.
Feinstein had been sent a letter of indictment against Ford's Kavanaugh in July, and the letter had been leaked in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
"I did not underscore Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not leak the story," Feinstein told the committee, reports The Hill.
"He told me to keep it as hard and I keep it as hard as requested."
But the president dislikes the woman's dismissal, who commented during the meeting on Saturday: "I tell you, it's a bad language of movement.
Maybe he didn't do that, but it's the worst movement language I've ever seen."
Proposing to defend the candidates of the Agong Court, who have been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use the allegations to achieve their own goals.
"They are eager to regain power in any way.
You see, cruelty, cruelty, they don't care who they hurt, who they sacrifice to gain power and control," the mediaite reported.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scores for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee stars pay off the Elite League defeat for Friday against the Belfast Giants by winning a 5-3 rematch in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants advanced with a two-goal victory through a kick from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie renamed the host position before Dwyer restored the Giants' victory.
Francois Bouchard scored for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen guaranteed a win for them.
This was the third loss of the Elite League for the season for Adam Keefe's team, who came from below to kill Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting this season between the two sides, with the Giants winning three previous matches.
Opening for Dwyer arrived in the fourth minute at 3:35 from Kendall McFaull's help, with David Rutherford providing help while Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
With what seemed like busy opening hours, Sullivan raised the host's eye at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became an assistant to Cownie's resignation at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants won the match during the first break when he scored his second goal that night at the end of the first.
The hosts then reunited and Bouchard once again matched the situation by scoring a goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give Dundee the first win in the past in the second half and he secured the win with the fifth team in the last half.
The Giants, who have lost four of five matches at home, Milton Keynes for the next match on Friday.
Air Traffic Controllers Are Victimized to Ensure Hundreds Aboard Airplanes Overcome Earthquakes
Air traffic controllers in Indonesia are considered heroes after being killed after ensuring that the aircraft carrying hundreds of passengers successfully landed.
More than 800 people were killed and many lost after a major earthquake struck Sulawesi Island on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
The strong winds continued to hit the area and many were trapped in the ruins of Palu City.
Although his friend fled, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung, refused to leave his control place at a powerful control tower at Sis Al Jufri Airport, Palu.
He didn't jump to make sure the 6321 Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he felt that the tower was going to collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reported.
We provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"Our hearts are broken listening to this news," he added.
Authorities are concerned that the death toll could shatter thousands with disaster mitigation agencies saying access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number of deaths is still rising due to many bodies still under wreckage and many that cannot be contacted," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, said.
A 6-metre-high slope has destroyed Palu, which will host a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft will bring in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the ambulance brings the body back.
Clean water is hard to get.
There are small shops all over the place."
Jan Gelfand, President of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross organization is in a hurry to provide assistance to the survivors but we do not know what will be found there.
It's a tragedy, but things can get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's army: "I ask you to work day and night to complete every task related to the transfer.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia has been hit by an earthquake earlier this year in Lombok killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini says passenger is missing after plane crashes
The airline that controls the plane crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia said a passenger was missing, after saying all 47 passengers and surviving crew members were evacuated from the plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon, the company has not been sure about the safety of a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline does not respond immediately to further requests for details about the passengers, such as age and citizenship.
The local boat helped rescue other passengers and children of the ship after the plane sank over the water during an attempt to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday and all of them were in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the sequence of actual events is still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon not far from the runway.
Some witnesses felt the plane was pulled out of the ground.
According to American passenger Bill Jaynes, the plane entered the runway in low condition.
"That's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other passengers managed to cross the water so high as the belt to the crashed aircraft's emergency door.
He said the pilgrims were in panic and screaming, and he only got a slight head injury.
The As Navy said the crew of the ship near the recovered dam also provided assistance by using a re-engineered boat to move passengers to the beach before the plane sank into 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network said 111 people had been killed in PNG-registered plane crashes in the last two decades but none involved Air Niugini.
Analysts give the nighttime line of women burned alive
The prosecutor dismissed the case on Saturday in a retaliatory conversation with a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett gave a statement for several hours as an expert witness in the field of smart analysis.
He outlined to the jury how he used cell phone records to compile a 29-year-old defendant movement, Quinton Tellis, and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she was killed.
Rowlett said he received some location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the eve of his death, contradicting the previous allegations, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed her cell phone along with Chambers' phone while she allegedly was with her friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford stood before the court and testified that he was outside the city that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was right, that he was in a Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he had "truly cheated because my truck was in Nashville."
Another controversy was, Trellis said he recognized Chambers two weeks before the woman's death.
Mobile phone records show that they only know each other for a week.
Rowlett said after Chamber's death, Tellis had deleted the call text and Chamber's contact information from his phone.
"He's got the woman out of his life," Hale said.
Lawyers are scheduled to start a closing hearing on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to go to the jury later that evening.

The hip hop trio wants to change the negative view of this genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hop has changed far from their original purpose, namely political message and social problems.

Artists like The Fugees and Common have seen the latest rise in the UK through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
NY's guardian disguised his partner as "racist"
A New York caregiver disguised his partner for his discriminatory dismissal after receiving a wrongful text sent to the villain who complained that he was "another black man."
The couple denied they were racist, equating the act of dressing up as "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her disappointment when she learned that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work on her first day in 2016.
"There is no such thing as a bully," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in the text.
She wanted to send the text to her husband, instead she had sent the message to Maurice, as many as twice.
After realizing his mistakes, Plasco-Flaxman who felt "uncomfortably" had fired Maurice, and said that the previous nurse, an African-American, was not working well and he expected the nurse's presence from the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one day of work and sent home with Uber.
Now, Maurice dresses up the couple to get compensation for the dismissal, and demands compensation in <0x24>350 a day for six months, compensation for the housing he has been offered, even if there is no contract.
"I want to show them, see, you shouldn't have done that," he told the Post on Friday, adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have responded to allegations that they are racist, saying the action to end Maurice's service was natural because they felt the woman was untrustworthy after insulting the woman's notice.
"My sister sent me something she didn't mean to do.
He's not a racist.
We're not racist," Joel Plasco's husband told the Post.
"But will you put your child's care on someone you've been cruel to, even if it's a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
"Not."
Calling the act of dressing as "extortion", Plasco said his wife had just two months of childbirth and was in "difficult situations."
“You want to wear someone in such a situation?
"It's not a good thing," added the banker.
During the case, the court quickly condemned the couple on social media, attacking them against their actions and logic.
Paddington's publisher is worried that readers are having trouble connecting with a talking bear, a new letter reveals
Bond's son Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It is difficult to put himself in the condition of the person who read the book first before the book was published.
It's really heartbreaking to know about Paddington's success."
She said her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired to write children's books, a little toy bear, was optimistic about her job being rejected, the woman added, the 60th anniversary of the book's publication as "sweet bitter" after her father's death last year.
About Paddington, he described as "the most important member of our family," he added, his father was proud of his success in the end.
"The father of a quiet man, he's not someone who likes to talk big," he said.
"But, because Paddington is too alive for him, it's like you feel like having a child who achieves something you're proud of even if you don't make it.
I think he saw Paddington's success like that.
Although the bear was his creation and imagination, he always credited Paddington himself."
My son is sick and I need to say goodbye over the phone.
After landing, the girl was sent to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, Nice in a hurry where doctors had worked their best to save her life.
"Nad calls me frequently to say that the situation is bad and she won't be saved," Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I got a call from Nad saying he was going to die in two minutes and I need to say goodbye to him.
And I did that.
I said, "Tashi, I love you, baby.
I'll be on your side soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicine is given by the doctor to pump his heart slowly out and leave his system.
He died before his time and this is all gone.
I just sat there and waited, knowing this was going to happen.
I can't cry or scream or cry because I'm in a situation surrounded by family and people.
I had to hold on."
Finally Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now saddened by the loss of her child, boarded a plane with other passengers - who did not care about the bitter experiences she had experienced.
"No one knows," he said.
"I lowered my head, and tears burst into tears at all times.
It's hard to describe, but on this journey I felt sympathy for Nad.
He needs my love and understanding.
I know how much he loves her.”
Woman sends postcards to avoid suicide on bridge
Two women who lost a loved one who committed suicide, work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have issued letters on the Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers to call for support.
Davis's son Tyler was 13 when he began depression and suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any mother to feel like I do every day," she said.
Davis, 45, lives in Lydney, said his son was a potential smuggler with an infectious smile.
“Everyone knows him with his smile.
They always say that their smile can turn on any room."
However, he stopped working before he died, because he was in "a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother met his brother after his brother committed suicide.
Davis said: "I'm worried about continuing if this will cause the effects of other things to happen."
Davis created a card, "to inform people that there's someone you can meet and talk to, even if he's a friend.
Don't just sit quietly - you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after Mark's mother's death.
"He didn't tell me he felt sad or depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we saw a change in his attitude.
He's very sad on Christmas Day - when children open their gifts, he doesn't look at them or anything."
He said the death of his partner was a big trauma to them, but they had to overcome it: "He made a big hole in the family.
It makes us split up.
But we have to keep going and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh's depends on the FBI's launch of investigations.
"I think, if we can get what he wants - a limited-time investigation, a limited scope - we can bring to the unit," Flake said on Sunday, adding that the "fucking" committee in the blockade based on beliefs that have been rooted in bloom.
Why did Kavanaugh and Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their deficiency is due to the intensity.
The midterm elections will be in just another five weeks, and on November 6 - if as expected, Republican decisions are not satisfactory, they will become weaker to get the people they want to kick in for the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has made a call to the Senator, lobbying them in support of Kavanaugh, who once worked at the White House for Bush and through Bush has met his wife Ashley, who became secretary to Bush.
What will happen after the FBI filed a report?
The vote will be held in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are sitting.
It is unclear whether Kavanaugh will get 50 votes from the Senate seat, which will allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to match the series and confirm his position in the Agong Court.
The number of North Korean fighters 'down' under Kim
The number of North Korean bids to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, according to South Korean lawmakers.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Southern Unification Ministry, said there were 1,127 voters last year - containing 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and the high rates imposed by people smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang did not give any public opinion.
Most of North Korea's buyers will be offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the Military Free Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers smugglers to be illegal immigrants rather than political refugees and often sends them back forcibly.
Relations between North and South - technically still at war - have improved over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the two heads of state met in Pyongyang for talks centered on negotiations on a deterrent nuclear power cut.
This took place after a historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in a general sense to head toward a nuclear-free course on the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the U.S. of restricting the development of talks since the incident.
"Without any trust from the United States, the security of our country is not guaranteed and, therefore, we will not start a nuclear disarmament first," Ri said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "emotional," and inappropriate to serve in the Court of Appeals
Minority Council president Nancy Pelosi called Agong Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "emotional" and said her appointment was not suitable for holding positions in Agong.
Pelosi made the following review in a Saturday talk meeting at the Texas Tribune Party in Austin, Texas.
"I believe if a woman behaves like that, they will say the woman is 'emotional'," Pelosi said of the reaction to Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has emotionally denied allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford while they were both teenagers.
During the opening of his reality, Kavanaugh beremosi, sometimes almost screams and cries when discussing family and while in high school.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats in the committee, calling for charges against him of "the excess and pollution of a well-designed name" handled by the still angry liberal Hilary Clinton who died in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's evidence confirming that he did not deserve to hold a position in the Agong Court, as it showed that he was heavily opposed to the Democrats.
"I feel that he has removed his own eligibility and his actions against the Clinton family and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi was questioned whether he would try to accuse Kavanaugh if he was approved, and if the Democrats got a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I would say this -- if he didn't speak the truth to Congress and the FBI, he wasn't eligible to hold positions in the Court of Appeals, but only in the court where he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's decision against the Capable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he was deposed as a conservative court.
In the verification trial, Kavanaugh avoided answering whether he would change the decision of the Agong Court.
"This isn't the time for a tough, heavier side to go to court and expect us to say, 'It's a fun move,'" Pelosi said.
Women need to show it.
It's a natural nitty-gritty word, an inflammation that lasts for months and years, and she can't withstand anger without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's amazing, do you?"
"I was helped by a woman, an executive in one place, who said she was also crying when angry, but had created a technique, if she felt angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
Then he proceeded.
And I think that's a wise suggestion."
Crying is allowed as a way of conveying anger because it is always misunderstood.
One of the most unforgettable memories of the old work, in the office dominated by men, I found myself crying with an inconceivable sense of anger, I was drawn by an older woman in the neck section - a cold manager I ran away - pulling me into the staircase.
"Don't show them your tears," he told me.
"They don't know what you're talking about.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy to make you sad."
Patricia Schroeder, a former congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was arrested for having a difficult relationship in a boat called Monkey Business out of the game, Ms. Schroeder was very disappointed, feeling no reason to stop her from joining the presidential campaign.
"It's not a carefully designed decision," he said, laughing at me 30 years later.
"There are seven more candidates who are competing and they don't need another candidate.
Some call it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Due to the events that took place at the end of the campaign, the woman was missing in an effort to set up a tube, and she vowed not to compete until she earned <0x24>2 million.
It was a futile struggle.
He found his supporters who gave <0x24>1,000 to the man would give him only <0x24>250.
"Do you think I can get rid of them?" he asked.
When he spoke that he would not launch a formal campaign, he felt a variety of feelings - grateful to those who supported him, disappointed with the system that sparked him asking for a donation and targeting non-candidate voters, and angry at sexism - and he felt a spree.
"You'll think I'm having a broken soul," Schroeder recalled about how the media reacted to him.
"You'll think Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember when I was thinking at that time, what would put on my nasal stone?
"She's crying?"
The U.S.-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The outbreak of the U.S.-China trade war may be overwhelming, and even though the battle is not over, the dispute between the two countries may benefit Beijing in the long run, according to experts.
U.S. President Donald Trump has issued the first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on Chinese exports including solar, iron and aluminium panels.
The most significant increase occurred this week with new tariffs affecting the <0x24>200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) value of the item, the effect being like taxing over half of the goods entering the U.S. from China.
Beijing responds in the same way every time, most recently, it imposes tariffs of five to ten percent on over 60 billion American goods.
China has vowed to retaliate every U.S. for action, and the number two largest economy in the world does not feel impressed.
To make Washington resign means submitting to the US will, but submitting to the US is too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
According to experts, if Beijing plays cards correctly, the pressure of the US Trade War could positively support China in the long run by decreasing the interdependence between the two countries.
"Political decisions by whether Washington or Beijing could initiate an uncontrolled economic situation in any country and appear more dangerous than what observers have previously observed," said Abigail Grace, a research fellow who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria is "ready" for return of political refugees, says foreign minister
Syria said it was ready to return the country's political refugees and asked for help to rebuild the country devastated by the seven-year war.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
"Today the situation in the country is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress made to combat terrorism," he said.
The government will continue to restore areas that have been destroyed by terrorists to restore to normal conditions.
The situation is now ready for the return of refugees, to the countries they are forced to leave due to violence and unilateral economic measures that affect their daily lives and search for them.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled since the war began in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to develop the devastated country.
But he insisted that the country would not receive conditional aid or assistance from the country that supported the rebellion.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by killing the U.S. team with the last 16.5, 10.5 det Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has now suffered six consecutive defeats in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 goals to defeat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, wrestling throughout the match, released a tee hit into the water in the par-3 hole 16, giving up losing to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfers excelled in all rounds, becoming 1 out of 4 players who have been 5-0-0 since the format of the game began in 1979.
American player Jordan Spieth was pulled out at 5&4 by the lowest-ranked player in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's top player, Dustin Johnson, dropped to 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England who may have played the last time for the Ryder Cup.
Eight Ryder Cup veteran, Spanish player Sergio Garcia became the winner of all-time Europe with a top score of 25.5.
“I rarely cry but can’t stand it today.
It's been a difficult year.
I am grateful that Thomas chose me and trusted me.
I'm so happy to have the cup back.
It's for the team, and I'm happy to help," Garcia said after the European championship.
He has handed over the task to John Ram who has defeated U.S. legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single game on Sunday.
"I'm proud to feel that when I beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him play," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods suffered a defeat for all matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 Ryder Cup work record.
Strange statistics by one of the greatest players, winning 14 major championships in second place only on Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend to find a track, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a good golf game throughout the match.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance from his team, "I'm proud of them, they're working hard.
There was a time this morning when we gave the pancakes to the European team.
We're trying our best.
Congratulations Thomas.
He's a good captain.
All 12 of his players played well.
We're going to get back together, I'm going to work with the American PGA and the Ryder Cup Committee and we're going to move on.
I love all of these guys and am proud to be a captain.
You need to lift the hat.
We have been defeated."

According to the FWC, bulky developments were reported in the Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier Areas - indicating a reduction in concentration.
The development of the Red Cross passes a budget of 130 kilometres of coast from the northern Pinellas to the southern Lee area.
The swamps can be found at 10 miles north of the Hillsborough area, but in less areas than last week.
The Red Riding Hood is also visible in the Pasco area.
Simple concentrations in or towards the sea of the Col Pinellas Region were reported in the last week, low to high concentrations towards the sea of Hillsborough County Region, background concentrations up to high in Manatee Region, high background concentrations up high backgrounds, in or to the sea of the Sarasota Region, background concentrations up to high
Respiratory distress is reported to be ongoing in the Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier Areas.
Respiratory insufficiency has not been reported in northwestern Florida in the past week.
