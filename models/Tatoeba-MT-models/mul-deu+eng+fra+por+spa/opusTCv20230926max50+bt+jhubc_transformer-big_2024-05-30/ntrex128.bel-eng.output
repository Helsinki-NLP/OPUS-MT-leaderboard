The U.S. government is concerned about what it looks like to be a Marianne.
Some MEPs do not understand why their MEP status should be changed to the status of "Member of the Parliament of Wales".
The deputies were upset over plans to change the name of the local East to the "Parliament of Wales".
Members of all political opinions believe that this is a scam.
One deputy labourer said that his colleagues are concerned that it is rhymed with the words "crazy" and "crazy".
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means "crazy" and pwp means "slutty".
The deputy said that her group was completely dissatisfied and offered alternatives.
Wales conservatives said their group was ready to discuss the name change of the East, but noted that it was a short verbal transition from a member of the Walloon parliament to a "Marynetak".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced the same as the English pronunciation of the letter u.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently developing a bill on amendments to the name, made a statement: “The final decision on any description of what the Deputies of the East call will, of course, be a matter of the members themselves.”
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gives the Welsh East the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a national consultation on proposals, which showed broad support for calling the East as the Parliament of Wales.
As for the title of an additional deputy, the Commission gave priority to the members of the Welsh Parliament or CNC, but the option of the CPC received the most support during public consultations.
Additional deputies, of course, offer alternative options, but the way to reach a consensus can be a headache for the president, Ellen Jones, who is thought to present a bill on changes over a few years.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes in the work of the assembly, such as the rules on the qualification of additional deputies and changes in the structure of the committee system.
Additional deputies will hold a final vote on the question of how they should be named when they are carrying out their legislative work.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will vote to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia" or against it.
The national vote was organised with the aim of addressing a multiannual issue with neighboring Greece, which has its own territory under the name of Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of their northern neighbor represents a claim on their territory, which has hindered Macedonia's inclusion and friendship in the EC and the North Atlantic Alliance.
Macedonia's President Georgie Ivanov, who worked for the referendum to change the name, said he would not take part in the vote.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the name change is simply the cost to be paid for joining the EC and the North Atlantic Alliance.
The Church of St. Martin is silent, the Churches in Harlem are fighting for existence
“Earlier, as the old people I talked to were saying, there was a bar and a church at every corner,” Adams said.
“There is neither one nor the other today.”
He said the disappearance of the bars was obvious.
“People have different communications and connections at the moment,” he said.
"The bars are no longer a cozy local guest, where people go all the time."
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not stop for as long as the leaders expect, and sooner or later they will return to where they started.
Churches, he added, can be replaced by living ladies with candaminiums, filled with people who will not help the temples that remain in the area.
“The vast majority of residents who buy candaminiums in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and that’s why it will accelerate the day when these churches close together, because it’s a year old, it’s a waste of people who sing.”
Both churches were built by the white community before Harlem became a black area – the Church of the Metropolitan Cathedral in 1870, the Church of St. Martin – more than a decade later.
The first white-methodical pattern was introduced in the 1930s.
The black man, who was praying nearby, was given the property rights to the building.
St. Martin's Church was haunted by the black community under the direction of St. John Howard Johnson, who ruled a bike of merchants on the main trade in Harlem 125th Street, where the merchant refused to hire a merchant.
The fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged, but faithful under the direction of Father Johnson planned a restructuring: they put the carylons into operation.
The parishioner David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's Church, proudly called the carylians "the names of the poor people."
The expert, who played at the carillon in July, called it differently: "The Cultural Treasure" and "the irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that it was the first caryl in the world to play black musician Diana A. Lind, who 18 years ago moved to the largest caryl in the Riverside church.
Mr. Merrivezer said that in the Church of St. Martin, he was not replaced.
What has happened in the Church of St. Martin in the last few months has been a complicated history between architects and supporters, some of whom have been attracted by the wrong leaders of the church, others – ecclesiastical.
The rise of the faithful – the governing organ of the arrival, consisting of the chaplain’s assistants – wrote in the diocese in July with a warning that the diocese “try to transfer the expenses” to the east of the faithful, although the rise of the faithful did not participate in the recruitment.
Some of the attendees complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark paralysed a 13-year-old boy during a dive to catch lobsters in California.
On Saturday, a shark attacked and paralysed a 13-year-old boy who was hunting for lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster hunting season.
The attack took place around 7 a.m. near Bakun Beach Beach in Ensinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy screaming, asking for help, and then swimming with the rest of the people to help.
At first, Hammel thought it was just an excitement from the lobbyists, but then he “did realize something bad was happening: “I was bitten!
I was beaten up!”
"The whole key was broken," said Hamel, adding that he noticed this when I got to the boy.
I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: “In the water next to the shark!” – added Hamel.
The boy was transported by air to the Ridge Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The variety of the shark that carried out the attack is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Lara Giles, said in a press briefing that the shark was spotted at the site a few weeks earlier, but it was decided that it was a safe variety.
Giles added that the victim had suffered injuries to the upper part of the tubular.
The protesters closed their approaches to the beach from Punta Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Esinitas for 48 hours to conduct an investigation and for safety reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are considered safe.
Sainsbury's plans to move to the UK's beauty market
Sainsbury's is going to work with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, opening beauty departments in the studios where trained specialists will work.
As part of a significant promotion to the British beauty market with a range of 2.8 billion pounds of sterling, which continues to grow, while the sales volumes of fashion clothes and household goods are declining, the size of the women in the beauty will be 11 times larger.
Investments in the field of beauty come because supermarkets are looking for a way to fill a place on shelves that were previously occupied by television sets, microwave ovens and household goods.
Sainsbury's said it will double the number of beauty products, offering up to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which will be on sale for the first time.
Existing ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space in corporate departments similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
Big stores are also re-launching their line of boutique cosmetics, so most of the products will be suitable for vegans, and this trend is becoming increasingly in demand among young buyers.
In addition, the perfume shop Fragrance Shop will test the end of two of Sainsbury's's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon in south London, and the second will open in Sali-Owk (Birmingham) this year.
Online shopping and the transition to buying small amounts of products every day in local stores around the house leads to the fact that supermarkets are led to make more efforts to be more attractive to visitors.
Mike Cope, CEO of Sainsbury's, said the trading points will be more and more similar to the universe, as a network of supermarkets is trying to compete with Aldi, Lidl discs with the help of more and more non-services.
Sainsbury's has placed the trading points of Argos in hundreds of stores, and has also placed a few points of Habitats since two years ago when it acquired both networks, which, according to him, contributed to the growth of sales of products and paper products.
The previous attempt by the supermarkets to reconstruct their beauty departments and pharmacy has not been successful.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the attempt to split the revenues from pharmacies ended after a series of breakups in supermarkets.
The new strategy emerged after three years ago, Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business together with 281 stores Celesio to the owner of the pharmacy network Lloyds Pharmacy for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million.
It has been announced that Lloyds played its role in this regard by expanding the range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Miles-Hicks, Sainsbury's Chief Commercial Officer, said: "We have changed the appearance of our beauty salons to improve the conditions for our customers.
We have also invested in the training of our employees, who will be able to offer their recommendations.
Our range of brands is designed to meet any needs, and the attractive atmosphere and convenient location make us the best home of beauty, which counteracts the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones broke up after Holly Willoughby resigned from the 11-million-pound deal.
Dragons star Den Peter Jones broke up after television host Holly Willoughby renounced the 11-million-pound deal with his brand, which specializes in the image of life and Mark ITV's focus on its new ends.
There's really no time for homeowners and homeowners.
The couple's business became similar to the brand Guinness Peltra Goop.
This morning, a 37-year-old woman announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragon's Den star Peter Jones, who is now breaking up with her lucrative business of creating branded clothing to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was distracted by the "golden" girl and admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire that he was in the city of Marlowe (Bankinghamshire), which was the time of her new year.
The business was similar to the Guinet Petra Goop brand and was doubled to double Williamby's wealth by <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 37-year-old Williamby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of the UK and headed to one of her vacation homes.
The source said: It was really the main focus of Holi.
It's a long-term future that she'll see in a few decades' time.
The decision to renounce her has left all of the participants completely dissatisfied.
No one wanted to believe what happened on Tuesday, so I had to start lunching very quickly.
The Marlow headquarters has a warehouse, full of goods ready for sale.
Experts believe that taking care of the leading This Morning, which is among the most significant British stars, can cost companies millions due to the huge investment in various commodities – from pillows and candles to clothes and household goods.
This could mean the end of a long friendship.
Williamby's mother and husband Dan Bolduin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Kapp for ten years.
Williamby founded True & Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Johns joined the chairmanship in March.
The couple rest together, and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in the Bolduin television company.
Willawby will become the representative of the M&S brand and will replace Mrs. McPortlin as the leading ITV "I - Celebrity".
Last night, a source close to Jones said, “We will not comment on his case.”
“Friendly talk, after which we fell in love”
He mocked the criticism he received from the mass media for his comments, which he deemed “non-President” because he was positively talking about the North Korean leader.
Why do you think President Trump has a lot to do with it?
Trump said in his paradoxical "dictator" vote.
“I don’t give up anything.”
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after the first meeting in Singapore in June was announced by Trump as a major step towards North Korea's denuclearization.
However, the talks on nuclear weapons have gone awry.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's leading diplomat Lee Yang Hoo said on Saturday as a world leader at the UN General Assembly that the North was not expecting "appropriate measures" in the U.S. response.
Instead, he said, the U.S. continues to enforce sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump has taken a much more optimistic position in his speech.
"We are building very successfully relations with North Korea," he said.
“It could have ended with a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
We have a good relationship now.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had brought positive results: the completion of missile tests, assistance in the release of settlers, and the return of U.S. troops to their homes.
And he defended his unusual approach in talking about the relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to be on the president’s side, but instead of 10,000 people trying to penetrate this crowded arena, we’ll already have about 200 people there,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the islands, killing hundreds of people.
For example, after the earthquake in Lambok, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that they were unnecessary.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of Lamboc's population has been relocated, no national disaster has been declared, which is a necessary condition for providing international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases it was clear that they were not seeking international help, so it was a bit difficult,” Sumbung said.
Although the Save the Children Foundation (Save the Children) and collects a team for a trip to Palu, it is not clear whether foreign workers can work on the spot.
Mr. Sutop, a representative of the National Agency for the Fight against Civil Disasters, said that Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to find out if it will be allowed by an international agency.
Despite the earthquakes that Indonesia has always experienced, the country is still well-prepared for the unpredictability of nature.
Although there were shelters built in the eye, there were hardly any other coastal pastures.
The apparent shortage of sirens to warn of the tsunami in Palu has resulted in a greater number of casualties, although there has been a warning.
Even at the best of times, moving between the many islands of Indonesia was a difficult task.
And the natural disasters have made it difficult to move logistics.
The hospital ship, which was placed on Lambock to treat earthquake victims, is approaching Palu, but the route to the new site of disaster will take no less than three days.
President Jock Widodo has concentrated his campaign to improve Indonesia's destroyed infrastructure and has spent money on motorways and railroads.
But the lack of funding will follow the administration of Jock, as there will be new elections next year.
Mr. Joka is also facing pressure from the ongoing inter-professional tensions in Indonesia, where representatives of the Muslim majority are adopting more conservative Islam.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands have been expelled from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs laundered in the streets using masks, bows and shotguns and other cold weapons.

Daniel Starge saved Liverpool from Chelsea's loss in Premier League, scoring the 89th minute on Saturday at London's Stamford Bridge.
The story got a transmission from Jordan Shakira when they were about 30 meters from the Chelsea warehouse, which ran 1-0.
He made a ball to the left of himself, before making a shot at a distant wand.
The attempt ended with a shot high under the top bar when the ball flew to the top right corner of the net.
As a result, the ball flew over the head of Cape Arysabalagi, which jumped right into the net.
“He was just trying to get into this position to kick the ball, and players like Shack were always trying to kick as far ahead as I could, so I was just trying to win us as much time as possible,” Starge told Liverpool.
"I saw that Counte was running, made easy pass, not thinking too much about it, and just hit the ball."

The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia increased to 832
The number of deaths from earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia has risen to 832, the Agency for the Elimination of the Consequences of Earthquakes said on Sunday.
At a press conference, a spokesman for the agency Sutop Purvo Nugroha said that, according to the messages, many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that were damaged as a result of an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
The city of Palu, in which more than 380,000 people live, has been plunged into ruined buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was abducted.
The investigation into the murder was initiated after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead (Mercedes) this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with clumsy injuries in the Graysan-Mouse area on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police have called on people from the area who have seen or heard anything about it.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I'd like to contact anyone who was near John Street in Burkenhead, or saw or heard something from the outside, and I suspected.
I also call on all, in particular, taxi drivers, video-recorders who may have taken some video, to contact us, as they may have information that is extremely important for our investigation."
A police official confirmed that the woman, whose body was found, lived next to Birkenhead and was found in her own home.
Today's friends of the woman came to the scene of the event to ask: where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, and police have said that they are in the process of informing the victim's closest relatives.
The taxi driver, who lives in Grayson-Moses, had just tried to return to his apartment, but the police told him that no one was allowed to enter or exit the building.
He lost his tongue when he found out what had happened.
The residents are now told that it will take a few hours before they are allowed to return.
The police have told one person that the entire area is now the scene of the crime. . . .
The woman was crying at the scene of the incident.
She said, "It's so horrible."
At 14:00, two police vans were in the enclosed perimeter, another van was called.
Several police officers were standing inside the perimeter, investigating the multi-storey building.
Anyone who has the information should call the <0x40>MerPolCC Police Department, call number 101 or contact the Criminal Police anonymously at 0800 555 111, calling the record 247 from 30 February.
The parliamentary statue of Cromwell became the last centuries-old blow in the case of the "rewrite of history".
Its removal would be poetic justice for its resemblance to the Taliban's destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artefacts, made by its fanatical Puritan followers.
"But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Kryk's proposal as "stupid" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, head of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the current debate over the demolition of the statue, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's monument near the Westminster Palace would become the object of these actions.
The Battle of the British Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the evil Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his great-grandfather Thomas in the previous century.
Mr. William Ham Thornikroft's brilliant representation of Cromwell is a testament to the 19th century thought and part of the historiography of the actor, which, as many believe, still needs to be respected.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many know Cromwell from the end of the 19th century better than today as a defender of parliament from external pressure, in his case it was a monarchy.
Or is it a very accurate representation, the subject of a long-running historical debate?
There is no doubt that the conflict of the mid-17th century formed the next development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually identifiable figure, which represents one of the sides of this conflict.
His achievements as a Lord-President also deserve to be honoured and honoured."
The killer was killed until the death of a Chinese farmer.
According to local media, the farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China.
"The man, known only by the nickname - Yuan, was found dead with a broken artery and shed blood, next to the bread market in Lupanshui in the province of Guizhou," - said South China Post.
The pig was prepared to introduce the vaccine with seeds at a pig shop in Xinjiang, China, on May 30, 2005.
It is reported that he, along with his stepbrother on Wednesday, came from neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his brother-in-law found him dead and saw that the doors of the neighboring pig shop were opened.
He said that there was a large pig in the porch with blood on the pole.
According to the report, a forensic medical examination confirmed that a 550-kilogram-pound beetle killed a farmer.
“My striker’s legs were covered and damaged,” said a brother named Wu, quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
A video from the surveillance camera showed that Yuan went to the market on Thursday at 04:40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed a man did not belong to Yuan or his hurricane brother.
The market leader told Evening News that the seeds were closed to prevent an attack on anyone else while the police collected evidence at the scene of the incident.
According to reports, Yuan's family and the market administration are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although cases where piglets attack people, they are rare, but they've been there before.
Yes, in 2016 the seeds attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, resulting in the man getting serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a <0xC2><0xA3>650-pound grain pressed a Valian farmer to his tractor and kept it until his wife had pushed the animal away.
After a farmer from Aragon was eaten with his seeds in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that the pork is usually non-aggressive, but the taste of the blood can act as a dropping rod.
“They’re just jokes.
They're tough and they're very demanding... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to give them the right amount of respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rose will bring heavy rainfall to the southwest of the United States.
According to the forecast, Hurricane Rose is weaker as it moves over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rose will bring flooding in northern Mexico and in the southwestern United States.
The speed of Hurricane Rose, a category 1 hurricane, was 85 miles per hour at 5 a.m. on Sunday morning, and it was recorded at 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
The "Rose" is expected to run to the north on Sunday night.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean, a low-pressure area is beginning to form, moving eastwards, to the western shore of the United States. When on Monday "Rose" approaches the peninsula, the low-pressure area of the U.S.
On Monday, Rosa will take up to 10 inches to some parts of Mexico.
Then the tropical moisture, which interacts with the inflatable low-pressure area, in the coming days will trigger strong rains in the southwest.
Places ranging from 1 to 4 inches of rainfall cause dangerous sudden flooding, rural flooding and possible emptyings in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will lead to the fact that the number of spots will reach 2-3 inches per hour, especially in some areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some areas of the northwest, especially in most of the Arizona, between 2 and 4 inches of rainfall is expected.
Due to the decomposed areas of tropical rainfall, it is possible to suddenly flood under the conditions of rapid deterioration of conditions.
It would be very unwelcome to go out in the desert on foot due to the possibility of tropical falls.
Heavy rain can cause the canyons to turn into turbulent rivers, and the rain will be accompanied by wind and dust.
The incoming low-pressure area will bring heavy rainfall to the locations in part of the southern coast of California.
Possible total accidents in more than half may lead to a slight flow of waste and make the roads slippery.
It will be the first month of the rainy season.
Some dissipated tropical rains will begin to approach the Arizon at the end of Sunday and early Monday, before the rain goes everywhere at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread in the Four Corners area on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
In October, strong temperatures can be observed in the U.S. as the Arctic is getting colder, but the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to a sharp change in temperature in the near future.
There is a good example of the sharp temperature changes in the central part of the U.S. on Sunday.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Amakhay (Nebraska), St. Louis, and De-Moon (Aowa), the temperature difference is about 20 degrees.
During the next few days, the summer heat will try to strengthen and expand again.
In many central and eastern U.S. states, warm October is expected to begin with a temperature of 80 degrees Celsius – from the South Plains to the Northeast.
The temperature in New York can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates the high probability of high temperatures in the eastern part of the U.S. by the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have watched the hearings of Bret Kavanaugh.
More than 20 million people on six television networks watched interesting witness shows on Thursday in the Supreme Court case between Bret Kavanaugh and Christine Blaise Ford, who accused him of having sex in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political opposition continues, the broadcasters interrupted their regular programs for the benefit of the emergency news on Friday: an agreement, which was developed by the Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, a spokesman for the FBI.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that she was 100 percent sure that a drunken Kavana had caught her and tried to pull her out of her clothes for an evening at the senior school.
Kavanaugh, in his own testimony, said that he was 100% sure that this was not the case.
It is estimated that more than 20.4 million people, reported by Nielsen on Friday, were looking at it.
The company calculated the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The data was not immediately available for other networks that showed this, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And in Nielsen, there are usually problems with the assessment of people who watch TV in the offices.
For comparison: the size of the audience is the same as when playing in a play-off or an Oscar.
“The Fox News channel, which the experts decisively supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, managed all the networks on average with 5.69 million viewers throughout the day,” Nielsen said in a statement.
ABC occupies second place with 3.26 million viewers.
“CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million,” Nielsen said.
The interest remained high, and after the hearings.
Flake was the main character of the drama on Friday.
After a moderate Republican's office published a statement that he would vote in support of Kavanaugh, he was caught by CNN and CBS on Friday morning, when protesters shouted at his address and when he was arrested.
He stood with his eyes closed for a few minutes when he was lied to, and it was broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m standing right here in front of you,” said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?
They said to him, "You have authority, but many women have delivered her."
Flake said his office had published a statement, and told him before the elevator closed, that he still had something to say at the hearings in the committee.
All cable and broadcasting networks carried live broadcasts for several hours, when the Court Committee had to vote on the question of selecting Kavana candidates at the Senate quorum.
But Flake said he would do this only by realizing that the FBI is considering charges against the candidate next week, which is called for by Democrats with a minority.
Flake was partially persuaded by talks with his friend, Senator-Democrat Kris Kuns.
After talks with Kuns and several senators, Flake made the decision.
Flake's choice was powerful because it was clear that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has begun an investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh at the FBI.
Britain's Prime Minister May Blame Critics in "Game in Politics" Due to Brexit <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
During an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May blamed critics for her plans to leave the European Union, for her "playing in politics" with the future of Britain and subjugating nationals.
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, arrived at the Conservative Party's conference in British Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In one of the interviews next to her on the first line of the newspaper was her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson, who spoke against her so-called "shadow" plan for Brexit, stating that the proposal was "Britain and the United Kingdom".
The murder of Wade Sims: Police arrested a suspect in the death of LSU player Dayton Simpson.
Police arrested a suspect in a deadly shooting in Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from the University of Louisiana.
"20-year-old Daeton Simpson was arrested and imprisoned on charges of second-degree murder," said Baton-Rouge police chief.
They showed a video of the shooting between Simpson and Simpson, and police said that Simpson lost his glasses during the raid.
“Police took the glasses from the scene and said they had Simpson’s DNA detected,” said WAFB, a CBS branch.
After Simpson's interrogation, police said he confessed to being shot dead in Wade.
“The cost of the institution is set at the level of <0x24>350,000,” says Advocate.
Eastern Batan Ruja's investigation published a previous report Friday, which said the cause of the death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department of the Louisiana State Police Operational Group, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the South University Police Department to ask the residents of the area for assistance in an investigation that would promote the arctic.
The sports director of the University of Louisiana, Joe Allieva, thanked the district’s legal body for its “endurance and aspiration for justice.”
Sammy was only 20 years old.
At the age of 6 feet he grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for the Louisiana University team.
On average, he scored 5.6 points last season, 2.6 points per game.
On Friday morning, Louisiana University's basketball team coach Will Wade said the team was "destroyed" and "in shock" from Wade's death.
“That’s what I’m always worried about,” Wade said.
A volcano is blowing up ashes in Mexico.
The ash, which is dotted by the Papacatepel volcano, has reached the southern areas of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for the Prevention of Civil Disasters on Saturday urged Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity occurred in the crater and 183 cases of gas and gas emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
In the middle of the room, there was a noise and a feeling of craziness.
Images on social media have shown that in the surroundings of Mexico, such as Sachimilka, there are thin layers of papyrus covering on the car windshield.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in volcanic activity, which is located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital after a magnitude 7.1 earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goa, has been active since 1994.
Conflict with Catalan separatists on the eve of the vote for independence
Six people were detained in Barcelona on Saturday after independence supporters met with police in order to protect the public order, and thousands of others joined the demonstration in commemoration of the first anniversary of the polio.
A group of separatists in masks, who were guarded by the police in order to protect the public order, threw their eggs and brightened them with powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets, which are usually filled with turquoise.
Later that same day, the fighting broke out when the police used their rifles to deter the protesters.
For several hours, a group of fighters for independence who chanted “Don’t Forget, Don’t Give”, met with the present trade unionists who shouted “Live Spain”.
According to local media reports, 14 people have undergone treatment from minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to the local press.
Tensions in the region, which seeks independence, remain high a year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid declared illegal, but which was designated by the Catalan separatists.
The majority of voters gave preference to independence, although the voter turnout was low, which was largely due to the voter turnout.
According to data from the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting in polling stations across the region as a result of the actions of the deceased protesters.
Groups in favour of independence held a night on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the Spanish National Police (NSP).
The protests continued, but the protesters were forced to go the other way.
Narcissus Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who is present on a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hopes for Catalonia's independence.
“We had one of the best moments last summer.
I saw my parents cry for joy when they could vote, but now we’re tired,” he said.
In spite of the life's significant but minor victory in the regional elections in December last year, the Catalan parties, which are in favor of independence, have tried to keep the momentum, the momentum and the momentum of many of their own.
42-year-old mechanic Jean Puch, who records a protest in support of the police on the phone, said the conflict was handled by politicians on both sides.
“It’s getting more and more stressful,” he said.
On Saturday, Ariel Junckeras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in the SIZA since the end of last year, announced that he will participate in elections to the European Parliament next year.
“Exclusion as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the repression of democratic values and repression that we have seen on the part of the Spanish government,” he said.
Londoners: Men Arrested After Smuggling a House in a Car
Three men, aged 33, 34, and 39, were arrested after their car crashed into a house in Londonder.
The incident took place in the Belingard-Cresent district on Thursday at around 7:30pm British time.
Detective-inspector Bob Blemings said the gate and the building were damaged.
At some point, a bullet may have been fired in the car.
As a result of Mang's hit "Livingstan" gets victory over "Rangers" with a score of 1:0
The first goal of Deli Mangi for the benefit of Liverpool secured them victory
The success of Livingston undermined the Rangers, and this was the cape to appoint Stephen Gerard after he had played several matches in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
The hit of Destiny Mange was great, as Gary Holt rose to one level with the Hibernians in the second division.
Gerard's team won't win in the Premier League this season and will meet with the leaders next Sunday, the Harts team, who are left with eight points.
For this, the Rangers in the Europa League will take the Venetian "Rapid" on Thursday.
"Livingstan," meanwhile, has continued its win-lose series in the division to six games, and head coach Holt still feels the momentum following Kenny Miller's replacement last month.
"Livingstan" misses chances due to gross visitors
Holt's team had to be alerted long before they were killed, but the same direction caused a variety of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke up, but lost his chance to kill at the gate, after which Alan Lithgow was only able to direct his forces wide to meet Craig Halkett's attack.
The hosts were happy to allow the Rangers to walk in front of them, knowing that they could bother the guest at some point.
And that's how the main goal was achieved.
On the side of the Rangers, a penalty kick was allowed, and Levingstan sent a debut, Deklan Gallagher and Robinson joined together to overcome Meng, who made a pass and killed from the center of the field.
So far, the Rangers dominated, but it turned out that the defense of the team was inappropriate, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was virtually uninvolved.
The same thing continued in the second half, although Alfredo Marelas really saved Caleb.
The ball from Scott Pittman was hit by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor, and the Litgows were far away from the second half of Livingston.
The balls were constantly hit at the Liverpool gate and were beaten, while the two demands for a penalty, after Halket was summoned to replace Glenn Middleton, and the demand for a penalty for the game by hand, were rejected.
"The Phenomenon" from "Livingstan" – analysis
BBC Scotland journalist Alessandro Lamant on the Arena Tony Macaroni
Fantastic performance and results for "Livingstan".
For men, they were great, continuing to surpass expectations on this ascending trajectory.
Their style of play and composition have practically not changed since their return to the upper echelon, but it is worth giving the proper Holt for how he stimulated the team from the moment of his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was a grandfather, building a well-organized defense, while Meng was holding Conor Goldson and Joe Warall on the field.
“Rangers” was not inspiring.
No matter how good they were at Gerard, they didn't meet these standards.
In the last game, they didn't have the ball, only once hitting in the goal, which was something like an alarming call for the Rangers, which were in the middle of the list.
A mixed attitude towards Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, smiles were seen and felt groundless summer slumbers when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which is aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They agreed on the issue of human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EC.
Erdagan is heading to Cologne to open a new giant ball.
The city is home to the largest number of Turkish populations outside the borders of Turkey.
The police were relying on security measures to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the ball, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of whom were Kurds, also expressed their views, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the decision of the German government to welcome him into the country.
Protests for and against reflect a diverse view of a guest, one of whom was declared a hero by the Germans, while others were convicted as an autocrat.
DTZ in Deptfard: The driver died in collision with a car
The driver died as a result of a car collision in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestudd Street and Evelyn Street, a revived road in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, around 10:15 British time.
The driver of the car stopped, the nurses arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The accident occurred a few months after another robber died as a result of a collision on Childers Street, about a mile from the site of the Saturday crash.
The police said that their employees are working on identifying the person and informing their closest relatives about the man's death.
Near the place there are road fences and bus stops, and the drivers were advised to avoid this area.
Long-Larkin Tournament: Six Employees Injured During Unrest
"Six touring officials were injured as a result of riots in the prison of a strict regime for men," the Penitentiary Administration said.
The rioters exploded in the Long Larkin Prison in Vustarshry around 09:30 British time on Sunday and continue to this day.
To combat the unrest, in which the eight displaced in one wing participated, a special group "Tarnada" was drawn.
At the scene of the incident, the employees underwent treatment from minor injuries.
A spokesman for the Penitentiary Service said: “Specially trained tour staff were directed to combat those who made the unrest in Long Larkin Prison.
Six of the staff members were treated after they had suffered a traumatic injury.
We will not suffer violence in our prisons, and of course, the culprits will be handed over to the police and can spend more time behind bars.”
The Long Larkin Royal Prison contains more than 500 detainees, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison was undergoing treatment in the hospital after the kidnapper's attack.
And in October of last year, police officers on the protection of the public order were called to jail to deal with serious riots, during which the employees underwent attacks with balls for the fireplace.
Hurricane "Rose" threatens the cities of Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with heavy flooding (which may be useful for drought regions)
Tropical hurricanes rarely occur in Arizona, but this is exactly what can happen at the beginning of next week, because there are remnants of Hurricane Rose in the southwestern part of the desert, which poses a dangerous risk.
The National Meteorological Service has already published data on sudden flooding in western Arizona, and in southern and eastern Nevada, south-eastern California, Sofía, and Utah, including Lafayette.
It is expected that on Tuesday "Rosa" will go straight through Phoenix, approaching with rain in the evening of Monday.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix said on Twitter that only “ten tropical cyclones have brought a tropical storm or pressure drop within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
"Catrina" (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles off the border with Arizona State."
The latest model of the National Hurricane Center predicts the occurrence of 2 to 4 inches, while in individual locations the level can reach 6 inches in the Magalhães area of Arizona.
In other areas of the south-western desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it is likely to fall from 1 to 2 inches, while the individual outcome values can reach 4 inches.
For those who are beyond the risk of a sudden flood, Hurricane Rose could be long-awaited, as their regions suffer from droughts.
While flooding is a very serious problem, some of these cases are likely to be useful because in the southwest, droughts are currently being observed.
According to data from the U.S. drought monitoring agency, at least a little more than 40 percent of the territory of Arizona is experiencing an extreme drought of the second category,” – reports weather.com.
Firstly, the path of Hurricane Rose leads to shifts in the Mexican hemisphere of Lower California.
On Sunday morning, the Rose still had the power of a hurricane with a maximum wind of 85 miles per hour at 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico, and is moving north at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm encounters colder waters in the Pacific Ocean and therefore calms down.
So, it is expected that in Mexico, when a tropical storm hits, there will be a river exit from the shores of the rivers during the day or night on Monday.
Accidents in various parts of Mexico can be severe, creating a significant risk of flooding.
"The total number of incidents is expected to range from 3 to 6 inches from Lower California to northwestern Sanlura, where possible incidents up to 10 inches," weather.com reported.
Then "Ruza" will move north through Mexico in the form of a tropical storm before reaching the border of the Isle of Man in the early morning on Tuesday in the form of a tropical pressure drop, which will then continue to move through the Isle of Man and the South.
"The main danger is expected from Rose or its remains, it is very heavy rains in Lower California and in the north-west of Sonora and the South-West Desert of the United States," the National Center said in a statement.
It is expected that these rains will lead to life-threatening and sudden flooding and rural streams and upheavals in the mountainous area.
Attack in Midsummer North: Four attempts to assassinate
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old boy have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after finding a 16-year-old body with a number of stitched wounds in Samersett.
Three teenage boys were found wounded in the Terrace Exclusive area of Midsummer North at about 4 p.m. on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital, where he was in a "stable" state.
“A 17-year-old boy and both others, 18 and 20, were detained overnight in the Redstock, Avon and Samersett area,” police said.
The police have appealed to anyone who could have any evidence on a mobile phone of what happened to move forward in their quests.
“Kavano is concerned about the subjugation and anger of the Democratic Party,” Trump said.
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for the abolition of the non-violent and absurd Democratic Party tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Willing, East Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh was "satisfied with the subjugation and anger" of the Democratic Party during the process of his nomination.
Kavanaugh gave a statement before Congress on Thursday, intensely and emotionally denying the accusations of Christina Blaise Ford for raping her for decades, when they were still smiling.
Ford also made statements during the hearings on her allegations.
On Saturday, the president said that "on this day the Americans saw a brilliant, noble and courageous character" Kavanaugh.
“The voice in support of Judge Kavanaugh is the voice of one of the most perfect experts in the field of law of our time, a lawyer with a great history of public service,” he said to a crowd of supporters of West Virginia.
The president confidently relied on the selection of Kavanaugh, discussing the importance of the Republican party during the interim elections.
"Five weeks remain until one of the most important elections of our time.
“I’m not just late, I’m actually late,” he said.
"That's why I'm fighting for big candidates everywhere."
Trump disagrees that the Democrats have the intention of “opposing and obstructing.”
“It is expected that the first key procedural vote at the Senate level for Kavanaugh’s expulsion will take place no later than Friday,” a senior assistant to the parliament’s leadership told CNN.
Hundreds of people have died as a result of earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia, the number of victims is increasing
“At least 384 people have died, many people have disappeared as a result of giant waves on beaches when a massive earthquake and tsunami began on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi,” the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves of six metres (18 feet) whitened over the shore in the swamps, killing many to death and destroying everything on their way.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake was followed by a tsunami.
“When the threat of tsunami occurred yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not immediately escape, and they became victims,” a spokesman for the Indonesian Agency for the Elimination of Poverty in Jakarta told a briefing.
“The thunderstorms dragged the cars, the barracks, the houses, hitting everything around the ground,” Nugroho said, adding that the thunderstorms passed through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (to 497 miles/h) before the attack on the coastal island.
According to him, some people survived only because they climbed the trees to escape the tsunami.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated in 24 centers of the city.
Air photos, published by the disaster agency, showed that many buildings and shops were demolished, masts rotated and collapsed, and the ball was surrounded by water.
The next day, they continued to rock the coastal town on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes took place in the area with a population of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Use of Technology (BPPT) said that the energy released as a result of a strong earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the capacity of the atomic bomb fired on Hiroshima.
According to his data, the geography of the city, which is located at the end of a long narrow bay, could increase the size of tsunamis.
Nugroha called the damage "wide" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were demolished.
According to him, the bodies of some of the victims were found under the walls of demolished buildings, adding that 540 people were wounded and 29 were missing.
"The damage and damage may be greater along the coastline at 300 km (190 miles) north of Paul, an area called Dongal, which is closest to the epicenter of the earthquake," Nugroha said.
Relationships in Dongal “were completely damaged,” Nugroh said.
“There are more than 300,000 people living there,” the statement of the Red Cross said, adding that its employees and hosts were directed to the affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, but it could have been much worse,” he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not reporting the tsunami in Palu, but officials said the waves came at a time when a warning was made.
In amateur photos posted on social media, you can hear a man on the top floor of the building despairingly screaming people on the street warning of inflammatory tsunamis.
Within a few minutes, the wall of water fell on the shore, dragging behind the buildings and cars.
Reuters has not been able to immediately verify the authenticity of the material removed.
Earthquakes and tsunamis caused a serious shutdown of electricity, which disrupted communications around Paul, so it was difficult for the authorities to recall the rescue actions.
According to the authorities, the troops began to target cargo aircraft with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still very much needed food and other items of first necessity.
The city's airport was only open for assistance and will be closed by October.
On Sunday, President Jock Vide planned to visit the evacuation centers in Palu.
As a result of the tsunami in Indonesia, more than 800 people were killed
It's very bad.
“While the World Vision employees from Danggala successfully headed to the city of Palu, where the workers are hiding in the sparkling caves set up in the court of their office, they saw scenes of landing along the way,” Mr. Doba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of ruined houses,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even when aid groups started dark actions to launch disaster relief mechanisms, some complained that foreign workers with in-depth knowledge were preventing them from going to the pool. . . .
In accordance with Indonesian rules, financing, supplies and personnel from outside the borders can only begin to intervene if the location of the disaster is declared as a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriyani, a press secretary of the Indonesian Red Cross.
After the government says, “Okay, this is a national disaster,” we will be able to open up for international assistance, but this status is not yet.
On the second night in Palu, after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family of the missing without notice hoped that their close-up miracles would be among those who would leave the unhappy storylines of the poor.
On Saturday, the boy was released from the sewerage.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been under the rubble for two days, and her child's body was next to her.
Gendon Subandon, the coach of the Indonesian national paraplane team, has prepared two of the missing paraplanes for the Asian Games that were completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi, including others who were trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, were his disciples.
"As an elder in the field of paraplanerism, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon said that a few hours after news of the Roa Roa hotel's collapse spread among the paragliders' community, he was desperately sending messages to a WhatsApp participant, Palu, who was following.
His posts, however, were marked with one row of galaxies, not two blue ones.
"This means that the messages weren't delivered," he said.
Thieves stole <0x24>26,750 while filling ATMs in Newport in Levi
"On Friday morning, the thieves stole <0x24>26,750 from a Brink employee who deposited bills at an ATM in Newport, Libya," the Newport police department said in a press release.
“The driver of the car dropped the ATM in the entertainment complex and was prepared to deliver more money,” wrote Dennis McCarthy in the release.
While he was busy, another man "flew away because of the Brink worker" and stole the ointment with cash, intended for delivery.
According to the report, the witnesses observed several suspects who left the scene of the incident, but the police did not report the number of participants in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identity should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kenny West: The rapper changes his name to Ye ("you").
The rapper Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
After announcing a change of name on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "I am officially known as Kenny West."
West, who is 41 years old, according to Ye, used the song as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The changes take place on the eve of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show, which was cancelled for “emotional reasons,” the show’s creator said.
Navalny, with the abbreviation of his current professional name West, said earlier that this word has a religious significance for him.
I believe that “ye” is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it is “you,” West said earlier this year, discussing the title of the album with the radio-leading Big Boy.
So, I – it’s you, I – it’s us, all this – we
It went from “Kaney,” meaning “one,” to simply “Ye” – a reflection of our good, our bad, our loss, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.
He's one of the most famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs was otherwise known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year announced that he was referring to the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former co-worker, Jay-Z, also passed away with no strings and capital letters.
The AMLO in Mexico pledges not to use the army against the peaceful residents.
Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel López Abrador has vowed never to use U.S. force against the civilian population as the country is approaching its 50th anniversary from the day of bloodshed.
On Saturday at the Tlatelolco Plaza López Abrador promised "never to use warriors to serve the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, the soldiers australian a peaceful demonstration on the square, which resulted in the deaths of about 300 people, while leftist student movements were incarcerated throughout Latin America.
López Abrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by awarding monthly grants to those who are studying, opening up the most free spaces in state universities.
“The unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities are attracting young people to criminal groups,” he said.
The U.S. needs to double its funding for machine intelligence.
“As China is becoming more and more active in the field of machine intelligence, the U.S. needs to double the amount it is spending on research in this field,” says Microsoft investor and specialist in machine intelligence, Google.
The comments came after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about the MI, even if the U.S. does not have an official MI strategy.
In the meantime, last year, China presented its plan: by 2030, it will aim to be the first in the field of MI innovation.
“Putting the budget on research in the MI area would be a good start, considering that all other countries are withdrawn from the U.S., and we are waiting for the next breakthrough in the MI area,” Lee said.
"The funding increase could double the likelihood that the next big achievement of MI will be achieved in the United States," Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "The Superpowers of Machine Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houton Miflin Harcourt, is the CEO of <0x2B>Venova, which is the CEO of the company itself.
In the 1980s at the University of Carnegie-Melan, he worked on a machine intelligence system that defeated the highest-ranked American player at Atele, and later he was the head of Microsoft Research and president of China's Google.
Lee acknowledged the previous U.S. government tech competitions, such as the Agency's robotics competitions for a forward-looking research project in the field of defense, and asked if there would be a next test to help out.
“U.S. investigators are often forced to work hard to get state grants,” Lee said.
“It’s not China that picks academic leaders; it’s corporations,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired lights from universities to work on MI.
Lee said a change in immigration policy could also help the U.S. strengthen its efforts in the field of machine intelligence (MI).
"In my opinion, green cards should be automatically offered to a candidate in the field of MI," he said.
In July 2017, the Government of China issued a plan for the development of the next generation of machine intelligence.
"China's National Fund for Natural Sciences provides funding to people in educational institutions, similar to the National Fund for Science and other governmental organizations. The Fund is allocating money to researchers, such as the U.S.A.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created a United Machine Intelligence Center, in which partners from industry and scientific circles should be involved, and the White House announced the creation of a specialty.
And this month, the Agency for the Sales Research Project in the field of Defence announced a <0x24>2 billion investment under the name AI Next.
As far as the National Scientific Organization (NSF) is concerned, it is currently investing more than <0x24>100 million a year in MI research.
In the meantime, U.S. legislation, which sought to establish the National Security Commission on Machine Intelligence, has not monitored the actions for several months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change the name of the country
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum to change their name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", which will allow to settle a decade-long dispute with Greece, which has blocked applications for entry.
Greece, which has the province of Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbor's name represents a claim on its territory, and has vetoed its accession to NATO and the EC.
In June, both governments entered into a deal with the proposed new name, but nationalist workers claim that these changes undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Georgiy Ivanov said he would not vote in a referendum, and the bike company questioned whether the voter turnout would meet the minimum of 50 percent required for the referendum.
The question of voting in the referendum proposes: “You are in favour of NATO and EC membership with the adoption of an agreement with Greece.”
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is the cost that should be paid for admission to institutions such as the EC and NATO Macedonia, one of the countries that Yugoslavia has emerged.
“I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the edict of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” – said Olivera, 79.
While this is not a mandatory legal force, a sufficient number of MPs have stated that they will take into account the results of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name requires more than two-thirds of the parliament.
The State Election Commission said it had not received notifications of violations by 1 hour of the day.
However, the egg accounted for only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when it voted 66 per cent of registered voters.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old voter in the capital, Skopje, Joe Tanevsky.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zaritz and his son Dushka voted for a referendum in Macedonia, dedicated to changing the country's name, which will open the way for its accession to NATO and the European Union in 2018.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkow prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of the chambers set up by those who will ride the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want unification with the heads raised, not through the service doors,” Kavadarkow said.
“We are a poor country, but we have the honor.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said that friendships in NATO will bring the necessary investments into Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
“I think the majority will be ‘in favour’ because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EC and NATO,” Zaev said after the vote.
He said the “yes” result would be a “affirmation of our future.”
In a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research, it is said that 30 to 43 per cent of the electorate will take part in the referendum, which is below the required egg.
Another poll conducted by Macedonian TV channels showed that 57 per cent of respondents are planning to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them said they voted yes.
For a successful referendum, the egg must be 50 percent plus one vote.
Failure in the referendum will be the first serious blow to the foreign government's policy since its arrival in May last year.
See: Sergei Aguera from Manchester City walks to the back through the entire defense of Brittany
On Saturday, Sergei Aguiar and Rahim Sterling solved the issue of defending against Brittany with a 2-0 Manchester City win at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
In the 65th minute, Agur did it with ease.
The Argentine attackers got a pass in the center of the field.
He was hiding between the three Brittany defenders before hitting the open field.
In the meantime, Aguirre was among the four green shirts.
He defeated one defender and killed several others on the outskirts of the British field.
Then he pushed his pass on the left flank, finding Sterling.
The English attacking first touch in a penalty shoot-out gave Aguer the ball, which used his right-hand hit to beat Brittan's goalkeeper Matt Ryan by hitting the right-hand side of the net.
“Agua has some problems with the legs,” Pep Guardiola, the city’s chief, told reporters.
“We talked about how he played for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored the goal at the same time.”
But it was Serling who gave Skye Blues an initial priority in the fight in the Premier League.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguera received this ball in the depth of the territory of Brytan.
He sent a beautiful ball through the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sean made a number of raids before Sterling was able to reach the long-distance squad.
Attacking "Sky Blues" directed the ball into the net before it jumped over the border.

Sheriff wants to play the role of "selecting points" against Rocky
After the Nationals were excluded from the competitions in the play-offs, there was no particular reason to forge a new start.
But the constantly competitive Sheriff hopes to take on a blow on Sunday against "Callad Rocky", but only if there are still the consequences of a play-off for Rocky, who remain in the lead after a single game.
The Rockies won at least one spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but still hope to get their first title in the division.
"Even in spite of the fact that we're just playing this way, at least we can cope with the situation, knowing that the atmosphere here, in Denver, with the crowd and other teams will be built in such a way that the game is likely to be at its highest level.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in this?
The Nationals have not yet announced the start of Sunday, but it is reported that they are inclined to give the Major a ball in such a situation.
The chairman, who was set to make his 34th start, held a session of the CPS on Thursday and will be on a regular break on Sunday.

Trump's speech in West Virginia.
The president faithfully relied on the situation around his election to the Supreme Court by Brett Kavanaugh, referring to the importance of the Republican party's presence in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is under threat in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important choices in our lives.
It’s one of the big, big – I’m not late, I’m actually late, so I’m fighting for big candidates everywhere,” he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see what’s happening right now.
And they are full of determination to return themselves to power, using any necessary means, you see, the suburbs, the measles.
They don’t care who they blame, who they have to deal with to gain power and control, it’s what they want, it’s power and control that we’re not going to give them.”
According to him, the Democrats have the intention of "opposing and obstructing".
“And you’ve seen it in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “bad, subtle, inverted, and lying.”
He relied on the Senate Judicial Committee for the prior recognition of Senator of the Democratic Group, Diana Feinstein, who received a high-profile rating from the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you let the document run out?
Uh-huh.
No, I’m not expecting it – it was a very bad nonverbal language – the worst language I’ve ever seen.”
Work is no longer the foundation of the church.
It's an impatience to those who express their opinions.
If the momentum activists in my local party voted to hurt me, it was hardly a surprise.
After all, I am the last in a row of Members of Parliament from the Labour Party to be told that we are not welcome – all to express our opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar reversal because she was decisively opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship exposed me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, on the irony of the fate of such issues, Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
In a statement on the meeting, which was held on Friday by the Nottingham Eastern Labour Party, it is stated that “we want these meetings to be local and productive.”
For most of my eight years as a local Member of Parliament from the Labour Party, such meetings were held on Friday.
Unfortunately, today in most meetings the tone is not so and the promise of a "more good, softer" policy has long been forgotten when it really was ever.
It is becoming increasingly obvious that in the Labour Party, different views are not allowed, and each comment is assessed in that respect, whether it is acceptable for party leadership or not.
It started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, because the colleagues with whom I used to think that I share the same political views, began to wait for me to take a step backwards, and I took my positions.
Every time I speak in public – and it doesn’t matter what I say – there is an absurd crackdown on social networks in which they call for the cancellation of elections, condemning the policy of the center, saying that I am no longer in the Lebanese Party.
And that's not just my experience.
In fact, I know that I have been more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments directed at me are usually political.
I am fascinated by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face the flow of sexual or racist goods on a daily basis, but never give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is the normalization of the level of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer an organization that adheres to different views, and with each movement of “incertitude” or change in party selection rules, it becomes narrower.
Over the past two years, I've been given a lot of advice that has urged me not to give up, not to be so loud, and then everything will be fine with me.
But that's not why I went to politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school student, witnessed by the excavation of the government of Thatcher, because of which my schooling in the school has been legalized, I have been trying to resist the best of the army.
I've never been able to hide my political views, including in the past elections.
No one in East Nottingham could ever get lost in my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who fought for this movement on Friday, I would like to say that if the country is headed for Brexit, which is hurting the homeowner, the enterprise and the greed of our public service, I don't understand the desire to waste time.
But in fact, the only message I have is not Nottingham Momentum, it's my voters, whether it's going to be lab members or not: I'm proud of what I'm serving you, and I promise you that no threat of voting will ever happen.

Air Melrow 38 - 17: The Invincible Air at the Top
Two later attempts may have said a few of the final result, but, without a doubt, Aire deserved a triumph in this strangely interesting Tennant Premier League match.
Now they're heading the tournament table, one side out of ten.
After all, it was their highest defense, as well as their best chances, which made them their hosts, coach Peter Murch had the full right to be satisfied.
"We've still tried our games so far, and we're still invincible, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robin Kristy of Melrowz said, "Give the right to Ayre, he's braver than we are.
A 14-minute attempt by Grant Andersen, transformed by Fraser Climate, put Ireland in the foreground, but a yellow card for Scotland cap Rory Hughes, obtained for the game Warriors, allowed Melrows to jaunt, beat and beat.
Climate strained Air's leadership with the help of a penalty, before, directly at the break, he killed, and then used a solo attempt, making 17-5 Air's at the break.
But Melrowze started well in the second half, and Patrick Andersen's attempt, converted by Baghdad, shortened the retreat to five points.
There was then a long delay due to the severe injury of Ruardyd Nott, which was stretched, and after a re-start, Aire proceeded further through the attempt by Stafford McDawley, implemented by Climate.
Air, performing the duties of Captain Blair McFerson, received a yellow card, and again Melrows forced another man to pay with the help of an unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvin at the end of February.
However, the hosts returned, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for kicking Climates without a ball off the penalty line, McFerson landed behind Air.
Climate realized his attempt, which he did again almost after a re-start, after Kyle Row got David Armstrong's hit in the penalty and sent Flanner Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt by the hosts of the field.
Star Still Game, apparently, is ready for a new career in the restaurant business
However, the star of the game Ford Kieran is about to enter the hospitality industry after it turns out that he was appointed to the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show he writes, and is filmed alongside longtime comedy partner Graham Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next sixth series would be the last in a series of shows, and it seems that Carnegie plans to act further after Craigland.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source said that Kernan hopes to take part in a "flowering trade in the Eye."
"Our Sea": Bali, which has no access to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific Ocean
The Marshals are patrolling the Mars headquarters in La Paz.
The city's buildings are under the blue flag.
In the military-martial bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the motto is painted “Mora is our right”.
Renewing is our duty.
In all of Bali, which has no access to the sea, remember the coastline lost to Chili in the bloody conflict because of the resources of the 19th century, still alive – as well as the desire to swim again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may have reached a peak in the last decade, as Bali is awaiting an international court ruling on October 1 after five years of discussion.
"Bali has an impulse, a spirit of unity and peace, and of course, it awaits a positive result," said Bali diplomat Robert Kalsadlya.
Many Bolivians will be watching the decision of the IC on large screens across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague after decades of tense talks supports a statement by the sea that Chili is bound to be bound.
Eva Marales is the charismatic president of Bali, who is facing a controversial struggle for re-election next year.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to take a decision in favor of Bolivia, and that doesn't change anything, even if it does.
The United Nations, which is based in the Netherlands, does not have the right to make a decision on the territory of Chile and has said that it will not determine the origin of possible negotiations.
The fact that the decision of the International Court of Justice comes out only six months after the final arguments have been considered proves that the case was “not complicated,” said Chilean expert on international law Pasz Zarate.
And not far from advancing the case of Balivi, the last four years may have been discarded.
“The problem of access to the sea has been manipulated by the current Bali administration,” Sarat said.
According to her words, Marales's infamous rhetoric has lost the rest of Chile's charitableness.
"Bali and Chili will continue to talk, but after that the discussion will be very difficult.
Since 1962, the two countries have not exchanged messages.
Former President Eduardo Radriguez Velce, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was extremely quick.
On Monday, Bali will have an “exclusive opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “end 139 years of mutual benefit,” he said.
Kalsadlyya also denied that Marales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the naval problem as a political support.
"Bali will never give up its right of access to the Pacific," he added.
“The decision is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen until it can't trust the U.S.
North Korea's foreign minister, Rae Yong Ho, said his country would never stop using its nuclear weapons until it could trust Washington, according to the statement.
Ry spoke at the General Assembly of the United Nations on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made during the summit between the leaders in Singapore.
His comments come as the United States. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, apparently, is on the verge of restoring nuclear-trumpet diplomacy with North Korean Kim Jong-un more than three months after Singapore.
Ry says it's an "invincible dream" that the continued sanctions and the US's objection to the declaration of an end to the war in Korea will ever put the North on its knees.
Washington is afraid to agree with the declaration if Pyongyang does not initially take significant steps towards disarmament.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump are calling for a second summit.
But there is great skepticism about the fact that Pyongyang is serious about renouncing the arsenal, which the country is likely to consider as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
At the Paris fashion show, we saw the latest line in massive headdresses on the way to shops in your cities.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely close the sun, you can no longer look for it.
Valentino's and Thom Browne's designers have unveiled an array of unusual headrests for their SS19 collection, which exceeded the expectations of Paris Fashion Week.
This summer on Instagram gained popularity by impractical hats, whose designers sent their creations to the podium.
The fine feature of Valentino was a luxurious beige hat, decorated with wide stripes, similar to feathers, that filled the heads of the models.
Other extraordinarily large accessories included decorated with gemstones, a magic hat and even pineapple, but they were not designed to keep the head warm.
Tom Brown also showed a collection of wise masks – just one time to Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were with stitched lips and more reminiscent of Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One of them resembled a scuba diving facility with tubes and protective glasses, and the other is similar to a melted cone of maroon.
And if you continue to stick to the great fashion attributes, you're fortunate.
Those who look at the style are predicting that huge hats can pass into our daily lives.
The large hats go on their way to "La Bomba", a salty hat with two-foot wide poles, which can be seen in all, from Ryana to Emily Rataikowski.
The cult label on a very uncomfortable hat, which was loosened in social networks, supported on another large creature on the floor – a salami beach bag, almost the same size as a bag of this model.
A dark-orange rape bag, decorated with rape octopus and covered with a white leather pen, has become a prominent part of the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at the Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I look forward to seeing large hats and beach bags on the main streets next summer, as the designer made a big impression, and it would be difficult to ignore the demand for a suitcase."
John Edwards: Knowledge of languages is a necessary skill for all citizens of the world.
The independent schools of Scotland retain achievements in academic success, it continues from 2018 with another excellent result of exams, which is reinforced by the individual and collective success in the sport, the arts and the arts.
More than 30,000 students across Scotland, schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to ensure the best level of work for their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further higher education, the careers they choose and their places as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can develop and implement an individual school program, we see that modern languages continue to remain a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a person in a language he understands, it stays in his head.
If you speak to him in his native language, it goes to his heart.”
It's a clear reminder that we can't rely on English only if we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
From the results of this year's final exams, we see that languages occupy the first place in the league tables with the highest rankings in independent schools.
In total, 68 per cent of students who have studied foreign languages have received the highest A-degree.
The data, collected in 74 SCIS schools, showed that 72 percent of students reached a higher A-class in learning Chinese, while 72 percent were in the same category as those who learn German, 63 percent as well as 69 percent of those who learn German.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills, which are undoubtedly needed by children and young people in the future.
Languages as subjects are now chosen in the same way as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK's Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that among the reasons employers have led to difficulties in filling jobs, 17 per cent were linked to shortages.
Therefore, more and more linguistic skills are becoming a necessity to prepare young people for a future career.
With more promising jobs requiring language proficiency, these skills are becoming necessary in a globalized world.
No matter what profession you take, if you learn a different language, in the future it will be a real advantage if you will have such skills for the rest of your life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person in the first place among the competitors.
According to a YouGov poll, which included more than 4,000 adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak well enough in a foreign language to lead the conversation, and French was the only language in which 15 people spoke.
That's why learning language is so important for today's children.
The availability of several languages, especially in developing countries, will give children more chances of finding a good job.
In Scotland, each school will be different in the languages it is taught in.
A number of schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK in terms of the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, in independent schools there will always be a choice of several languages with a faculty that is a specialist in this field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will educate children and equip them with the skills they need to achieve success, regardless of what will be in the future.
At present, it cannot be denied that in the global business environment, languages are still vitally important for the future of the country, so it should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be viewed as “the skills of international communication.”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and preference for young people in Scotland.
It's got to be done
John Edward, Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron debuts on Sunday in San Diego
A start of waiting for fans who want to see LeBron James make his first start at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play at the opening of the pre-season Sunday against the Denver Nights in San Diego.
But how many minutes it's going to take is still to be determined.
"This will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Lackers reporter Mike Trudle wrote that James is likely to play in a limited amount of minutes.
According to the practice that took place this week, James was asked about his plans for "six game pre-season schedules".
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career to get ready," he said.
The time of Trump's speech in West Virginia, YouTube channel
Tonight in Willing, West Virginia, President Donald Trump is launching a series of campaigns for the company.
It's the first of Trump's five scheduled speeches next week, including breaks in friendly locations, Tennessee and Mississippi.
In affirming the vote on the advent of the election to fill the vacancy of the Supreme Court, Trump seeks to strengthen the support of the ongoing interim elections, as Republicans risk losing the chances of losing.
When will Trump's speech begin tonight in West Virginia, and how will he view it on the Internet?
Trump's performance in Willing (West Virginia), scheduled for 7 pm. ET tonight, on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's performance in West Virginia online below on live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to consider this week's candidacy hearings in the Supreme Court by Brett Kavanaugh, who is having problems with the opportunity of prosecutions in sexual harassment with a pending confirmation in the Senate.
But the main purpose of these speeches is to provide assistance to Republicans who are facing the election in November.
Thus, President Trump's campaign announced that these five speeches next week are aimed at "activating the activities of the welcomers and supporters," as the Republicans are trying to defend and defend the country.
"Control over the Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will go to the maximum number of states as we enter the tense campaign season," the president said in a statement.
Scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena in Wiling, today’s action can attract fans from the Hague and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media,” the West Virginia Metro News reported.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump visited West Virginia, a state in which he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the West Virginia Senate candidate Patrick Morris, who is the leader in the polls.
“This is not a very good sign for Morris that the president should come to try and give him a kick in the queries,” said Simon Hedar, a politician at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team is advancing to fight to keep hope alive on Sunday
After three single-session sessions on Saturday, maybe it was just what you needed for this Ryder Cup.
The key to the impulse that is happening is a completely invented sporting concept, in which players sincerely believe, and nothing more than similar competitions.
So where do you think they're going to be now?
“They had a six-point lead, and now four, so I think we’re going through it with a little impulse,” said Jordan Sleep, traveling for a day.
Of course, Europe's advantage is four points ahead, and there are twelve more in the game.
Americans, as Spitch says, feel that the wind has taken hold of them, and they have something to hope for, not least, because of the form of Spit and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day, and each day.
Spite was deadly from soccer to green and is an example.
These gargantuan screams of celebration became more and more loud as his round lengthened, and he dropped a decisive blow to play in a match on four pitches when they and Tomas joined two by two.
His strike, which allowed them to win in the 15th game, was meetings like a scream, such as the one who tells you that he believes the American team is not excluded.
“You just have to get deeper and worry about your own game,” Spitzi said.
All of these players have already gone.
Eighteen to make a mark.
In the last two days, the only players to have scored more points than Spot and Thomas are Francesca Malinara and Tommy Flywood, the undisputed history of the Raider Cup.
Surprising but charming couples in Europe four out of four and can't do anything wrong.
The Malovuds were the only couple that did not make the gods on Saturday, the second half of the day, but they also avoided the gods on Saturday morning, Friday and the second half of the day on Friday.
It happens, and how their energy, like, runs to this stormy crowd and from it, and it confirms that they are the players who will win on Sunday, and there would be no more popular golfer to close the game.
Both are desired at the same time at different angles.
The debate on European fame is a timely one.
Bubba Watson and Web Simpson did a short work on Sergei Garcia, the hero of the previous sale, when he was in a relationship with Alex Noreen.
The gods and two twins in the previous nine expelled the Spaniard and the Swede from whom they had never been able to go out.
On Sunday, however, no one will be able to help you with your lunar eclipse.
For matches of four balls and fours it's so interesting to watch because of the interaction between the pairs, the tips they give, the tips they don't follow, and how the strategy can change at once.
Europe has become the best team so far and has taken on a significant role in the last day, but this fourth session also shows that the U.S. team is striving to fight, in which some have doubted, especially the United States.
Europe will go to the finals of the Ryder Cup with a score of 10-6
Europe will get a good lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of Saturday's four-ball and Thursday's matches with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired duo of Tommy Flywood and Francesca Malinara led a fight against Tiger Woods with two wins to hang the results at Le Golf National to four points.
The European side, Thomas Burns, in an effort to keep the trap they lost in Hazelstein two years ago, prevailed in the U.S. agency's dissatisfaction this morning, getting a series of 3-1.
The U.S. offered more matches in a four-ball match, winning two matches, but they couldn't do more.
In order to keep the draw, Jim Furick's side needs eight points out of 12 singles matches on Sunday.
Flywood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row, and he and Malinara, who got the name Molliwood after a sensational comeback, are just the second pair to win four points in a row.
Having defeated Woods and Patrick Reed in four balls, they made great strides to defeat Woods and American picker Bryson Decombe in the 5th and 4th.
Woods, who played two games on Saturday, showed a random glow, but now he has lost 19 out of 29 times in four balls and four and seven times.
Justin Roosevelt, who rested on x four-ball matches, returned to partner Henrik Stansen in four-ball matches to the 2 & 1 parade of Dastin Johnson and Brooks Koepki – occupying one and two places in the world.
Europe did not have its way, although it was pleasant, fresh day to the south from the west of Paris.
On Saturday, three-time winners Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas set a checkpoint for the Americans by two points.
They won 2 and 1 wins over John Ram and Ian Pulter from Spain in four ball matches and returned later to beat Pullman and Rory McLaren 4 and 3 in quarters, losing two rebounds.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has the team returned from a four-point deficit, which goes solo, although the side of Furyk's owners only needs to draw in order to save the trophy.
However, after the next two days, which were the best, the counterattack on Sunday looks like they're all getting it.
North Korea says it will not “in any way” be disarmed in a unilateral order without trust
North Korea's foreign minister said on Saturday that the United Nations is continuing sanctions that are intensifying in the face of the U.S., and in such circumstances the country cannot give up nuclear weapons at once.
Ry Yun Ho said at the annual General Assembly of the World Body that last year North Korea took "significant measures of good will", for example, a cessation of nuclear and missile tests, and the dismantling of nuclear weapons.
“But we don’t see a proper response from the United States,” he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no certainty in our national security, and in such circumstances there is no way in the first place in a unilateral order to disarm itself."
In spite of the fact that Ri has re-published the usual North Korean complaints against Washington's "step" approach to dynuclearization, in the framework of which North Korea was rewarded with the award,because it accepted the award.
Ri relied on a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first in history meeting of the US president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim's promises to work on the path to a "nuclear crisis".
North Korea seeks to officially end the Korean war from 1950 to 53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang should initially give up nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed a call for the lifting of tough international sanctions against North Korea, the UN said.
“The United States of America initially insists on ‘denuclearization’ and increasing the level of pressure by means of sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive way, and even opposes ‘declaration’.
"Accepting that sanctions can put us on our knees is an insurmountable dream of people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our distrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader had designated earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: "If it weren't for the participants of this issue,the issue of nuclear detonation would have been South Korea's.
However, the tone of Ri's speech sharply differed from last year when he spoke to the UN General Assembly, affirming that the U.S.'s call to the continent with the help of a missile from North Korea was "inevitable" as a "fog"
This year in the UN, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take measures to disarm, but said that there is still a lot to be done, and that there is still a lot to be done, and sanctions.
Trump said on Wednesday that he had no timeframe for this, saying, “If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia are discussing in the UN. The Security Council has stated that it is worth rewarding Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary-General Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that “the implementation of the Security Council’s sanctions should continue actively and necessarily until we are sure in full, final and final.”
The Security Council stepped up sanctions against North Korea in 2006, trying to halt the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the Security Council. The General Assembly then announced that he would visit Pyongyang again in the coming months to prepare for the next summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip has not been a success.
In July, he left Pyongyang, stating that the progress made with North Korea over the course of several hours of talks ended with a visa statement that he posed demands "like gangsters".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea has pledged to eliminate its missile installation and nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
Trump said Kim said the “appropriate measures” he awaited were a guarantee of security and a desire to normalize relations with Washington, which Trump promised in Singapore.
Harvard's students are taking a course on the right rest.
The new Harvard University course this year is supposed to teach students to sleep more, and my goal is to compete with the culture of learning at night with coffee in hand.
The scientist has come to the conclusion that students at one of the best universities in the world often do not know how to properly care for themselves and their health.
Charles Chassler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a hospital specialist named Brigham and a woman's hospital, developed a course that he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
Inspired by the influence of sleep deprivation on learning, he started the course.
At the end of the lecture, a girl came up to me and said, “Why did they tell me this only now, at the last lesson?”
“She said no one ever told her about the importance of sleep – it surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
For the first time this year, a course taught by students explains why good sleep habits promote academic and sporting achievements, as well as improve the overall mood.
Paul Barrera, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health care service, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were often overweight.
The course, which lasts an hour, involves a number of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a room on the internet, where students click on cups of coffee, curtains and books that tell about the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deprivation affects sports indicators, as well as weight gain.
At the next stage, participants are told how multiple sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
The map of the campus, with interactive drawings, invites participants to think about their daily lives.
“We know that this will not immediately change the behavior of the students.
But we think they need to know it as well as everyone knows about the health effects of smoking,” Professor Chasler added.
According to him, the culture of nighttime evenings still exists, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students leads to sleep deprivation, which is becoming an increasingly problematic.
“Ensuring sufficient sleep of good quality should be a ‘secret weapon’ of students to combat stress, depression and anxiety,” he said, “even to avoid overweight, because avoidance can be avoided.”
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old Californian student studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chassler develop the course.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to train everyone on campus.
He hopes that the next step will be a request for all insurers to complete a similar curriculum before enrolling in the university.
Professor Chassler recommended that students be able to set a clock to know when to go to sleep and when to wake up, realizing the harmful effects of "blue light" that can be emitted from monitors and light bulbs.
"Livingstan" 1:0 "Rangers": Menga kills Gerard's goal.
The Rangers suffered another blow when Dolly Mange’s goal assured Steven Jarard that he would not get a 1-0 blow at Liverpool Stadium.
Ibrax wants to record his first victory on the way to a 4-1 win in February in St. John's, but Gary Holttan's team is already bringing the second hit to Jerarda as the manager of the 18-game Heather's team to leave Labrokes on his side.
Manga was hit seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers, inspired by the naked, didn’t seem to be suffering from a break.
At the same time as the Rangers landed in sixth place, Levingstan took third place, with the Hibernians behind with a difference in the balls.
For the Rangers, additional problems may arise after Forward Calum Spence has to be treated for a head injury after the object has been thrown from the trunk.
Gerard made eight changes to the players, which led to Ireland's failure to play in the Batford Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Levi at number 11 that allowed him to take a point from Hearts last week, and was delighted at how well they passed their opponents at every step.
The Rangers had more possession of the ball, but Lithuania made more attempts to kill the ball.
They had to be killed two minutes later, when Menge first directed the ball through Scott Pittman to Alan McGregor's backs, and then the midfielder took advantage of this opportunity.
Jacobs Keegan's successful penalty kick sung Craig Halkett's footage, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow was able to hit the back.
The Rangers took control, but in the last third of the games they were more likely to kill than they were to demonstrate a good game.
Alfredo Marelas, of course, should have been fined a quarter of an hour before the end when he and Steven Lowell met on the field, but Judge Steven Thompson did not accept the Colombian complaint.
The Rangers managed to hit the goal only in the first half of the game, but former goalkeeper Ibrox Liam Cali barely scored a goal for Lasan Kulibali and an effective striker Ovi Echiria.
Although he scored his first goal in the 34th minute, he may have been against a further active game, but no one denies that they have to demonstrate a good game to the audience.
Again, the Rangers were unable to pass the Jacobs Gate.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Deklan Gallagher handed over to Scott Robinson, who blocked Meng for an opportunity to kill at the gate.
Gerard replaced Kulibali's break with Ryan Kent, and it had an effective effect when the attacker ran to Marelas, but the impressive Kelly escaped and blocked the strike.
But "Livingstan" continued to please the visitors, playing the game that they liked, and the Lithgows and Halkett continued to share the ball after a long confrontation.
Holt's side was only able to dominate in the last few minutes, but McGregor played well to oppose Jacobs before the League went to the reserves.
The replacement of Rangers to Glenn Middleton occurred a number of times after the penalty, when he met Jacobs, but Thomson was forced to resign.
Almanac: The inventor of Geiger's counter.
Page from our almanac "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and PADLIKI... the day of future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Heiger, who was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, which resulted in the emergence of a device known as Geiger's counter.
Heather's accountant became a part of science and appeared in pop culture, as in the 1950 film Called Karanad, which featured those seemingly renowned scholars Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: Who is he on the earth?
Rogers: "This is a Geiger counter that is used to search for radioactive minerals such as uranium.
"When you put on the headphones, you really have the ability to hear the sounds of atoms that give radioactivity to the minerals."
Evans: “Tell me, this is really necessary right now?”!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that bears his name, continues to be used.
A new progressive vaccine can help the immune system "see" stem cells.
A new anti-inflammatory vaccine can help the immune system "see" bad cells and destroy them.
The vaccine, as it were, teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells, which will be part of the treatment.
The method involves obtaining immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory.
Then the cells can "see" the whites, spread to many cancer cells, and then re-introduce the auxiliary cells.
The test vaccine demonstrates successful outcomes for patients with different types of cancer.
One woman, who was given a vaccine that helps the immune system recognize cancer cells, found that ovarian cancer disappeared for 18 months.
The method involves obtaining immune cells in the patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can "see" the HER2 proteins common to many cancer cells, and then being reintroduced.
This was stated by Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland. Our results show that there is a very promising vaccine.
“HER2 stimulates the growth of several types of anti-cancer cells that fight breast cancer, ovaries, light and thick cats,” said Professor Berasofski.
A similar approach to the detection of immune cells in patients and "learning" them to reach cancer cells worked well in the treatment of leukemia.
Canyon West has begun a discussion in support of Trump, bearing the title of the IAEA, after it appeared in the SNL.
Which didn't work well.
In the studio during the evening of Saturday evening, Kanye West was humiliated after a speech where he praised the United States. President Donald Trump said he would be sworn in for a second term in 2020.
After performing his third song in the evening, "The City of the Arrival", when he was in the Hat "Make America Great Again", he spoke against the Democrats and confirmed his support for Trump.
“How many times do I talk to white people and they say, ‘How can you support Trump, he’s a racist?’”
“Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have left America for a long time,” he said.
The SNL began the show with the lead role of Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star star starred over Bret Cavano's statements before the Senate jury during a hearing on the sexual violence case of Christine Blaise Ford.
Despite the fact that the performance was not broadcast, West's words fell into the picture and were uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
I don't know if he's trying to get away from West.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had a hard time behind the scenes.
They came up to me behind the scenes.
They said, “Don’t go out there with this hat.
They've slipped up on me.
“And then they say I’m in a hurry,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner newspaper.
West continued: Do you want to see the blurred place? "Saying he's" above my Spermman's cap, which meant he can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Try to LOVE.
Due to his statements, the hearings were removed at least twice, and the representatives of the SNS were confused by a message from Veraity. “The whole studio was silent.”
West was accepted as the replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West surprised many by performing the song I Love It, dressed in a Perrier water bottle.
West received support from TPUSA Conservative Party leader Candes Turner, who tweeted: “One of the most courageous spirits Thank you for your support.”
However, as Karen Hunter wrote, West is just who he is, and it's always wonderful.
“But I have decided not to reward anyone by buying his music or clothing, or by supporting his ‘art’, which I think covers and unfolds an ideology that is damaging to my community.
He's free.
And so are we,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that he is now "officially named Kenny West".
He wasn't the first artist to change his name, and went on to follow Djidji, also known as Puff Djidji.
His colleague rapper Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion's rock and, of course, a legend of music that changed his name to a symbol, and then he and an artist, formerly known as the Prince.
Attempted murder at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after he was attacked at a restaurant in the eastern part of Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Balihakamor, according to the police.
The defendant is expected to appear in Belfast's court on Monday.
Prosecutions will be considered by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The star of "Game of Thrones" Kit Haringtan has idealized brutality.
Cat Harington is known for his stirring sword and the role of John Snow in the "Game of Thrones" series in the age of medieval HBO crude
But the 31-year-old actor received the stereo of the hero macho, which means that young boys often feel harder to respect.
Speaking to the Sunday Times Culture Department, Kate said she believes "something has happened" and asked how to solve the problem of idealized brutality in the <0x23>MeToo era.
The cat, who recently married his neighbor on the Game of Thrones, Roosevelt Leslie, who is also 31, admitted that he feels powerful in solving this problem.
"I personally feel like a strong guy - if we were mistaken with the courage," he said.
“Why do we teach men when they grow up, from the point of view of the attitude we see now?”
Cats believe that television should be responsible for the appearance of brutality due to the very male characters.
He continued, “What is the beginning, and why should we teach it?
Why learn on television and on the streets, which makes young boys feel that they have to be so confident in order to be a real person?
I think that’s really one of the biggest questions of our time – how will we change it?
It's obvious that something is going on with young people.
In the interview, he also admitted that the series will end next summer, and he will leave the battlefield of the series and will not do do docs or sequels to "Game of Thrones".
From November, Cat will begin releasing the true Western Sam Shepherd, who is a historical director with his brother, who is a slave.
Recently, the actor said that he considers meeting his wife Roosevelt the best opportunity to finish "Game of Thrones".
“I met my wife in this series, so I got my future family, and my life here,” he said.
Rose was played by Ygritte, a character who is in love with the hero of Kite John Snow in this fantasy series, the award-winning Amy.
The couple got married in June 2018 at a meeting in Leslie, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China has said that the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
According to health workers, more than 820,000 people have been infected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were registered.
Most of the new cases were transmitted through sex, as it was in the past.
Traditionally, HIV infection is prevalent in some areas of China as a result of infection through blood transfusions.
"However, the number of people who have been infected with HIV through blood transfusions has been reduced to almost zero," Chinese officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China grows by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV infection through sex is an acute problem of the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination in relation to LGBT people still exists.
Due to the conservative value in the country, about 70-90% of men who have sex with men, eventually get married to women.
Many diseases are common due to insufficient knowledge and sexual contraception.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address this global problem.
Maxine Waters rejects the misunderstandings of today's debates and the theory of her parliamentary colleagues
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday dismissed the allegations that her employee posted personal information about three U.S. Republican senators on Wikipedia's pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that there is a claim to the participants of the upper wing and their websites.
“Lies, lies, and a lot of bitter lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information, as reported, includes home addresses and phone numbers in the United States. Sens. Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, both from Utah.
Information posted by an unknown man on the Capitol Hill during hearings of the Senate commission on allegations of sexual harassment in relation to a member of the Supreme Court, Bret Kavanaugh, appeared on the Internet.
The incident took place some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
“Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState report that the source’s IP address was linked to the Waters office and shared information with the Waters staff,” Hill said.
“This unsubstantiated assertion is completely false and absolutely false,” continued Waters.
"A member of my team, whose data, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these Asukan and false accusations, has not at all been responsible for the leak of this information.
This unsubstantiated assertion is completely false and is absolutely false. . . .
Waters' statement quickly sparked criticism on the Internet, including from former White House press secretary Ar Flasher.
“This refusal induces anger,” Fleisher wrote.
This shows that she doesn't have the courage to be a member of the Congress.
If someone is accused of not doing what they've done, they shouldn't be caught.
They don't have to be absurd.
They don't have to question the motives of their accusations.
They need to be calm and decent.
Flasher compared Waters' reaction to critics of the Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh when they were accused of being too caught during Thursday's hearings.
Amar Navarre, a candidate from the Republican Party, who is contesting and participating in the sittings in the interim elections, also spoke on Twitter.
"It's a resonance if it turns out to be true," he wrote.
In a statement, Waters said that her office had warned the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities about these false statements.
"We guarantee that the culprits will be found," she continued, "and they will take legal responsibility for all their actions that are distructuring and dangerous to any of my team's employees."
Johnny English Strikes Again strikes the ingenious spy Rowan Atkinson.
Now it has become a tradition to search for the meaning of Brexit in any new film with a British inclination, and this inclination seems to be in the comedy and action franchise Johnny English. The title of the song was "Johnny's Day" which started in 2003 with John's "The Day" and "The Day" of John.
Is it possible for a satirist to express himself well in terms of how clearly unstable we seem when it comes to new export opportunities?
In any case, the second time he appeared in the press, incompetent Johnny English was given the opportunity to laugh at things – his name was louder than all the comic books that he made for non-English audiences.
Of course, he's a secret agent, who, despite his wisely claiming glamour, got a bit like Clouseau with the features of Mr. Bin and a little bit like a guy who brought a single note to the Fire Horse in 2012.
Initially, his character was based on the adventures and international mysteries of Atkinson, who once played in the forgotten Barclaycard, leaving chaos on his way.
Here are a few fun moments that have never been before.
I loved Johnny England, who is approaching a helicopter, dressed in medieval costumes, and the rotor blades slightly touch his helmet.
Dar Atkinson for theatrical comedy is clearly demonstrated, but humor feels weak, and therefore it is surprising especially when serious films such as "Agent 007: Mission Impossible" are certainly proposed by the comedy.
Humor feels like it's not just for adults, but for children, and even the ridiculous unhappy cases of Johnny England aren't as inventive as the silent films of Atkinson in Ben's face.
A long-standing idea is that there are serious problems in the United Kingdom.
Cyber-hacker penetrates into the super-secret community of British spies in the UK, opening the names of all British agents on the spot, to disappointment of the jazz agent - this is, unfortunately, a small role of Kevin.
This is the last drop for the prime minister, who is a proud and confused actor who is already suffering from political impopularity: Emma Thompson doesn't do everything possible with this quasi-thersey-all.
Her intelligence advisers report that, since every real spy will be discovered, she will have to engage one of those who are already retired.
And this means that for John England himself, everything is complicated: now he works as a sixth teacher in several chic establishments and gives lessons on how to be uncovered by the operator: some good examples here, because English is a good one.
English returned to Whitehall for extra briefing and reunited with his former longtime friend Bo, who is again played by Ben Miller.
Currently, Bo has a marriage tied to the commander of the submarine, the role of which Vicky Pepperdin performed a little in vain.
In this way, Batman and Robin get horribly wrong things in the Queen's secret agency, where they work again, meeting a beautiful woman, Volga Kurilenka.
Meanwhile, the prime minister receives a dangerous order from a charismatic technical billionaire, who claims that it can solve the problems with the hackers of the UK: with the vicious Jason Voltam, who plays Lee Jay.
English and Bow begin their action with immediate things: hide under an official, light up a French restaurant; create a pogrom, fight with smugglers on board a luxurious yacht of Volta; The English do the smugglers clean up.
All the moments are tense for the last event, but just as pleasant and noisy, in which there are quite a lot of kids on TV.
It's a pretty good material.
And like with other movies about John England, I couldn't think: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really demonstrates his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is developing a plan to pay the British for a four-day working week with a payout of as much as five days.
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn should consider a radical plan if the British work only four days a week, but pay them for five.
It is reported that the party wants the leaders of the enterprises to pass on the work results of the work done as a result of the revolution of artificial intelligence, giving them an additional day off.
It was apparent that the employees would be able to enjoy a three-day leave, but they would still get the same earnings.
The source notes that the idea corresponds to the party's economic program and plans to direct the country to support the workers.
The Trade Union Congress adopted a four-day week transition as a good way to take advantage of the change in the economy.
A senior source in the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: “A planned review of the actions will be announced by the end of the year.
This will not happen now, but a four-day working week is an idea that corresponds to the party’s view and the overall industrial strategy of regulating the economy for the benefit of workers.
The Labour Party is not the first to endorse such an idea, the Green Party promises to spend a four-day working week during the general election campaign in 2017.
However, the demands of the Labour Party as a whole are not supported.
A representative of the Labour Party said: A four-day working week is not a goal of party politics, and it is not considered a party.
Chancellor John McDonald's used a working conference last week to express his view of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonald said he had decided to return power from "non-political directors" and "managers" to communal enterprises.
The shadow Chancellor's plans also provide that the current shareholder of water resources may not get back the entire package of shares, because the Labour government can make a "choice" on the basis of alleged violations.
He also confirmed that it is planned to contribute employees to the boards of companies and create joint venture funds to transfer 10 percent of the company's own funds to private employees, which will hold annual dividends of up to 500 million dollars.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy told for "60 Minutes" that FBI investigators working with Kavanaugh had to change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the allegations in connection with Judge Bret Kavanaugh has been postponed for a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court at least for a week. A question arises as to whether the Bureau's conclusions will be able to be drawn.
In a radio interview on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pale asked Republicans John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about the Sens: "Can the FBI reveal anything that could lead to change?"
Kendall seems to be more open-minded than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kandy.
“I said, going to court: I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after how it happened, and I asked him about the reason for the charge, asking, “Did you do that?”
He was decisive and unambiguous.”
Graham's vote, however, seems to be final.
“I think Bret Cavano has decided that this will be a scandalous accusation,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Bret strongly denies it," Graham said, referring to Blaise Ford.
“And everyone she calls, she couldn’t believe it.
She's only 36 years old.
I don’t see anything new.”
What is the International Citizens' Day and what has been done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the International Festival is taking place in New York: an annual musical event, which has a very impressive composition of performers and performers and has a mission to end poverty in the world.
Now, for seven years, the World Citizenship Festival will take place on the large beech of Central Park, where tens of thousands of people will come to enjoy the pleasure of the concerts of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Manson.
The International Festival of Citizenship, which emerged in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Project against the heaviness of the international propaganda group, which hopes to end poverty at the cost of increasing the number of people.
In order to get a free event ticket (if you don't want to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors have to perform a number of tasks or "rest of the action", to be a volunteer, to write by e-mail, to lead
But how successful has the festival been over the course of 12 years and has it been able to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people for a free concert in a real way to convince people of the need for active action, or is it just another case of the so-called “clittism” case – people feel that it is wrong?
Since 2011, the organizers of the festival have announced that they have recorded more than 19 million "actions" from their supporters who strive to achieve different goals.
It says that these actions have helped push influential leaders to make commitments to more than <0x24>37 billion, which could impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group made 390 comments on commitments and claims in the amount of at least <0x24>10 billion that have already been allocated or collected.
According to the group, the funds provided so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments700 include the provision of food, partnerships with investors and performers based in the United Kingdom, "help the children to grow to the fullest extent", the promise of "toys to the fullest extent"
“With the support of the Government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and citizens of different countries, we can make the social injustice of inequality in history,” Ambassador Tracy Ulman said in London in April 2018.
In addition, the group said that after more than 5,000 actions were carried out, which were called on in the UK to improve the nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced the funding of the project "food aid 5", as well as food aid.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, “What makes you think we can end poverty?”
The World Cup said, "It's going to be a long and difficult journey, sometimes we'll be patient with anger and anger.
But, like the great civil rights and movements against apartheid, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Wickend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janel Monae are one of a number of Persons who will perform at this year's event in New York City, which will be hosted by Debar-Lee Ferness and Hue Jackman.
U.S. can use the Navy for "blackheads" to prevent Russian oil and gas exports
"Washington may, if necessary, turn to the naval fleet to prevent the entry of Russian energy into the EU and Middle East markets," U.S. Secretary Ryan Zink said in a statement to the Washington Examiner.
Zink argued that Russia's actions in Syria, in particular where it operates at the request of a legitimate government, are a basis for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason for their presence in the Middle East is because they want to acquire energy as much as in Eastern Europe and in southern Europe,” he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the opportunity, with the help of the naval fleet, to ensure the openness of the naval powers and, if necessary, to organize a blockade so that their energy is not likely to hit the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event, organized by the Alliance of Energy Consumers, a non-commercial group that positions itself as the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are essentially the same.
“The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less equalizing and replacing fuels,” he said, calling Russia a “proliferative country” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements came at a time when the Trump administration wants to significantly increase exports of its recycled natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is much cheaper for European consumers.
For this purpose, Trump administration employees, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to get out of the "wrong" pipeline project "North Stream 2", which, according to Trump, has "transformed"
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the <0x24>11 billion North Stream 2 gas pipeline, which is being created to reduce the power of the existing gas pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusively economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to this project is taking a start in the economy and is an example of unbridled competition.
“I think we have the only view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” said the Minister of Energy of Russia, Alexander Novak, after a meeting with the Minister of Energy.
The Americans were hit in response from Germany, which reaffirmed their readiness to the project.
The main German organization representing the industry, the Federation of German Industrialists (BDI) has called on the United States not to interfere in the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Maastricht.
"I have a big problem when a third state is interfering with our energy supply," said Dziter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Trade Unions (BDI), after a recent meeting with the German Trade Union (BDI).
"Elizabeth Warren is going to be very serious about her participation in the 2020 presidential election," a Massachusetts senator said.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that it would be serious to consider her involvement in the presidential election after the midterm elections.
During a speech at the mayor of Halioki, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering the possibility of her participation.
“It’s time for women to head to Washington and take over our ineffective government, and I’m also talking about women in the highest positions,” she said, according to The Hill.
“After November 6th, I will be very serious about the possibility of talking to the president.”
During a speech in the mayor’s office, Warren criticized President Donald Trump, saying he was “leading the country in the wrong direction.”
"I'm extremely worried about what Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren has openly criticized Trump and his nominee in the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, “Of course, before the vote it is necessary for the FBI to conduct an investigation.”
However, the results of the poll published on Thursday showed that most voters don't think Warren should be in the presidential election in 2020.
According to a poll by the Safalka/Bostan Glowb University Political Research Center, five-eight percent of Massachusetts' "possible" voters said the senator should not be debated.
Thirty-two percent support the decision.
The poll showed greater support for former Governor Daval Patrick, with 38 percent in favour and 48 percent in opposition.
Other well-known names among Democrats that have been discussed in connection with the potential 2020 strike include former vice president Joe Biden and state senator Vermont Barney Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden has announced that he will officially make a decision by January.
At a rally in support of Donald Trump, Sarah Palin mentioned the post-traumatic syndrome of Tracey Palin.
26-year-old Trace Palin spent a year in Iraq after calling for service in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence, and he was charged with rape.
“That, through which my son goes after his return, I can compare with the results of post-traumatic syndrome and wounds with which our soldiers return, in other families,” she said at a meeting in support of the support.
Palin called the aristocracy a "simple question" and stated that her son, along with other war veterans, "returns a little bit to others, hardened, returns with the question of whether there is any other respect for which the mercenaries have fought."
He was detained on Monday in Washington, Alaska, and was accused of domestic violence against women, obstruction of attempts to report domestic violence, theft of weapons in a drunken state, etc., etc.
18 states and the county of Columbia support the opposition to a new policy on the provision of ports
Eighteen states and the county of Columbia support a new U.S. policy that denies the harbor victim of gang-related or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and counties of Colombia dropped an analytical record on Friday in Washington, D.C. to support the opposition's policy of supplying the port, according to NBC News.
The full name of the creature in the Grace vs. Sessions case, which was opened in August by the U.S. Civil Rights Union against federal politics, has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and his friends with a hard gang" had raped her, but the US authorities refused to take her to the port on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
Lawyers of the states that support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which the largest number of requests for asylum in the United States comes, as countries that have serious problems with the gang's hamlet.
The new U.S. refugee policy has changed the 2014 decision of the Immigration Appeal Commission, which allowed immigrants without documents who are victims of domestic violence to turn to the refugee.
The District Attorney General of Colombia, Carl Raisin, said on Friday that the new policy “is detracting from decades of legislative experience of states, countries, and the world.”
"Federal legislation requires applications to the port to be based on concrete facts and circumstances of the case, and such a change violates this principle," the analytic note said.
Lawyers also stated in a note that a policy that denies immigrants is deteriorating the U.S. economy, saying that immigrants can often become entrepreneurs and “create the necessary jobs.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to no longer give shelter to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"Presence is given to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership of a social group or political opinion," Sessions said in a statement on 11 June.
The present has never meant solving the problems, even all the serious problems, that people around the world face every day.
Desperate rescue work in Palu. During an attempt to find the survivors, the number of deaths has doubled
Those who have survived are in a very difficult situation.
"It's very tense," says 35-year-old mother Rysa Kusuma, calming her young son with temperatures in the evacuation center of the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute, the machine "fast" brings the whole thing.
The clean water is very small.”
Residents began to return to their ruined houses, picking up the wet things, trying to save everything that could be found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake were overcrowded.
Some of the wounded, including Two Harris, who broke the shoulder and shoulder, are located outside Paul's military hospital, where patients are being treated on the street due to repeated strong push-ups.
Tears appeared in his eyes when he recalled the sensation of strong underground shakes in the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to be saved.
I was stuck under the ruins of the walls," said Harris Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the city for marriage.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, but then the silence.
I don't know what happened to my wife and daughter.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "threatening" the use of "pragandish advertising"
A week after the official Chinese newspaper printed a four-page advertisement in the U.S. daily, praising the mutual benefits of the U.S.-Chinese trade, the U.S. ambassador to China went to war.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday mentioned a paid supplement China Daily in the Des Moines Register – the state’s best-selling newspaper – after accusing China of attempting to accommodate the 6-year-old in the election.
Trump's accusation that China tried to interfere in the U.S. election, noted that U.S. officials in talks with Reuters named a new phase in the Washington-based campaign for pressure on China.
Although the placement of advertising by foreign governments is a normal practice for promoting trade, now Beijing and Washington have unleashed a trade war, which has resulted in the mutual imposition of tariffs.
Repressive tariffs, said U.S. and Chinese experts, have been introduced to harm such exporters as entrepreneurs from the state of Aya, who support the Republican party of Trump.
Terry Brensted, the U.S. ambassador to China and former Iowa governor, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businessmen.
China, writes Branstad in the author’s article in the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register, “is now doubling its efforts by printing propaganda in our free press.”
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the good American tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of the press by printing paid advertisements in the Des Moines Register,” Brensted wrote.
"And if you look at the newspaper kiosks in Beijing, then there you won't find so many voices against and you won't see a real reflection of the other opinions that the Chinese may have about the dangers of a dangerous trajectory in the economy.
He added that "one of the most influential Chinese newspapers has refused to offer" to print his article, although he did not name the newspaper.
Republicans are pushing women's voters ahead of the Kavanaugh physicist's midterm elections, analysts warn
While many well-known Republicans are defending the candidate for the post of Supreme Judge Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several allegations of sexual violence, analysts have warned that they will receive a blow to the enemy.
The emotions around it were very strong, and the majority of Republicans already show that they are ready to vote.
"These things can't be returned anymore," said Grant Ryhoar, professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University's The Hill edition for the article, which was printed on Saturday.
Rieger said he was not sure that Senator Jeff Flake's statements about the FBI's investigation would be enough to calm the disillusioned voters.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow and in November,” said Karin Jean-Pierre, chief advisor and national press secretary of the Progressive Group, MoveOn Gas.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November fast!" during a demonstration in the Senate hall, when Republicans, who control the legal committee, decided to remove the Kavanaugh candidate, despite the request of the candidate.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be extremely great," Stu Rottenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news site.
“People say they’re already tall, and that’s true.
But they can be even higher, especially among women voters in the suburbs and young voters between the ages of 18 and 29 who don't like the president, but often don't vote."
Even before an open statement by Ford, in which she detailed her allegations of a candidate in the Supreme Court for sexual violence, analysts believe that if the Republicans insist on affirmations, they may have a place in the court.
"For the Republican Party, this has become a bit of an impediment," said Michael Steele, a former chairman of the National Committee of the Republican Party at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"The thesis is not about the vote of the committee or about the final vote, or about whether to get Kavanaugh in office.

However, it's similar to the fact that Americans have split up on the issue of Ford or Kavanaugh's rights, so it's a little more than the latter.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents are likely or not very sure to trust Ford's statements, and 35 percent said they are likely or not very sure to trust Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that in their opinion, Kavanaugh may or probably have listened to his statement, and 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After a move by Flake, the FBI investigates allegations by Ford and at least one other person, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford made a statement under oath before the Senate Legal Committee that Kavanaugh, when drunk, had sued her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that a Supreme Court candidate demonstrated her genitalia in the evening when they were studying at Eile in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Inventor Plans to Launch New Internet to Compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the global network, is launching a start-up that will be made by competitors Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company that is built on the open platform of Berners-Lee Solid.
Solid allows users to choose the location of the data storage and who has permission to access this information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that, by creating Inrupt, he meant "domination over the world".
“We need to do it now,” he said about the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The program uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "data storage on the Internet" or POD.
It can contain contact lists, topics lists, calendars, fanatics, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser at a time.
The uniqueness of the personal data store on the Internet is that only the user determines who has access to what type of information.
The company calls this a "personal enhancement of the potential with the help of data."
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea of creating Inrupt gives the company the opportunity to connect the resources, processes and skills needed to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a number of developers working on the contract project, and coders-evaluators.
Starting this week, tech developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized programs, using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Brners-Lee said he and his team did not talk to Facebook and Google about whether or not to make complete changes when all of their business models are instantly reviewed.
“We’re not asking for permission.”
In a Saturday publication on the issue of Medium Berners-Lee wrote that the Inrupt mission "is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to protect the integrity and quality of the new network created on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet, creating a Consortium of the World Network at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been very influential in the neutrality of the network.
Even launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Network Consortium, the Network Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m very optimistic about the new era of the network,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: The Hearing of a Priest, Winner of the Victorian Cross in the First World War
The only priest of the Anglican Church, awarded with the Cross of Victoria during World War I as a participant in the war, was celebrated in his city more than 100 years ago.
Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Van was awarded on September 29, 1918 for his involvement in the attacks under Belengis and Leakour.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a bullet shooter and never learned that he had received the highest British military award.
On Saturday, in the town of Rashden, in the county of Narthamptonshire, two of his grandchildren opened a memorial stone at the parade.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it was "very symbolic" that the stone opened just 100 years after his grandfather was rewarded.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Van led his battalion through the Canal de San Quentin "through the thick moment and under the strong armor and bullet fire of the worker."
Then he ran to the line of fire and "with great courage" led the soldier forward, grabbing the gun on his own and ejecting the three divisions.
Captain Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, and a little more than a month later the war ended.
The 72-year-old Michael Van said his grandfather’s actions were “something I could never do and also something worthy of respect.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also raised the eldest daughter after the council, which presided over the Imperial Youth Orchestra of Brentwood.
Michael Van said it was "a great honour for him to take part in the parade" and added that "the manhood of a real hero was demonstrated by the support that many have shown."
MMA fans waited all night to watch Bellator 206, they instead got a Peppa lead
Just imagine you've stayed all night to watch the packed broadcast of the Bellator 206, and then you're denied viewing the main event.
The program had 13 battles with San Jose, including six on the main map, and they aired live all night on British TV Channel 5.
And on the sixth morning, when Gérard Musashi and Rory McDonald were preparing for the battle, watching the UK just sneezed when the program changed to Pep's pig.
Some were disappointed after having spent the night without sleep, deliberately awaiting this battle.
One of the bullies on Twitter called the switch to a children’s cartoon as “something stupid joke.”
In response to a question about the broadcast, Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President Bellator on Marketing and Communications, said: "According to the state resolution at 6 a.m. this content was inappropriate and had to be switched to play."
“Yes, Swinka Peppa.”
Bellator's president Scott Cocker said that in the future they will work on the program to include British viewers.
"I think we're discussing the possibility again, I think we can solve this issue," Cocker said.
"But now it's six in the morning on Sunday, and we can't solve it until Sunday at our time, and it's Monday at their time.
But we're doing everything possible.
Believe me, when the programs were changed, we received a lot of messages and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to solve the problem by assuming that it was a technical error.
But it turned out to be a government decision.
I can assure you that this won't happen next time.
We're going to reduce the number of fans from six to five, as we usually do, this time we wanted to recommend to the fans, but we stopped.
It's the end of the situation."
Tom Dale's "Finding a Uninhabited Island": Tom Daley Feels "Small" Because of Sexuality
The Olympic water jumper Tom Daley said he grew up feeling less important to others because of his sexuality – but that gave him motivation on the path to success.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t understand that “not everyone is like me” until he went to high school.
Speaking on Radio 4's "Discovery of the Uninhabited Island" program in lead Laurent Laverne, he said he supports gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that when he had a baby, he began to think less about defeating the Olympics.
Traditional leader of this rather old program, Kirsty Young, took a break for several months due to the disease.
In the role of the man who appeared on the uninhabited island on the first Laverne program, Dale said that as a child he felt "less" than all others, because "the community did not accept those who liked both boys, and thought."
He said, “I still feel that this feeling that you are not like everything and insignificant was what gave me the strength and inspiration to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “someone,” he said, not to disappoint those who knew about his sexuality.
The double-bronze Olympics award has become a major activist of the LGBT movement and at the Games of the Association in Australia this year called on the country not to criminalize homosexuals.
He said he expressed his opinion because he was fortunate to live openly, without persecution, and wanted to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said that when I fell in love with a man – American screenwriter, director, and producer Duce Lance Blacke, whom I met in 2013 – “it was unexpected for me.”
Daley married Oscar owner, who was 20 years older than him last year, but he said the difference in age doesn't matter.
"If you're going through this at such a young age" – at the first Olympics he happened at the age of 14, and even after three years his father died of cancer – he said that it was difficult to find a lighter that would be so bright.
In June, they became parents, their son named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daley said that his "perspectives" had changed completely.
“If you asked me last year, I’d tell you I need to win a gold medal,” he said.
"You know, there are things in the world that are more important than the Olympic gold medal.
“Robie is my Olympic gold medal.”
His son is also named after his father – Robert. His father died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept the fact that he died and one of the last things he asked about was whether they bought tickets for the 2012 London Olympics – he wanted to sit in the first row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘You’re not going to sit in the first row, Dad,’” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he stopped breathing and died, I finally realized that he was not immortal,” he said.
The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I just knew that's what I've been dreaming of all my life - jumping in the water in front of my ballet players at the Olympics, that's the best feeling," he said.
It also influenced the selection of the song – Proud by Heather Smol – which found a review in preparation for the Olympics and from which the carrots are now running.
"The Search for the Uninhabited Island" can be heard on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15pm British Summer Time.
Michaelsen, who is not in shape, will stay on the bench of the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Michaelsen will set a record on Sunday after playing his 47 games in the Ryder Cup, but he needs to get his form back so that the event does not become unhappy.
Michaelsen, who will play in this competition, which will be held once every two years, a record 12th time, team captain Jim Furick has placed on the table of substitutes for Saturday's Formula One.
Instead of being at the center of the event, and he was often there for the United States team, the five-time cup winner split his days between the choreographer's work and the coaches, hoping to get back in shape.
Even at the peak of his career, he was not the best player, and now the 48-year-old golfer is not the perfect choice for the difficult Le Golf National field, where inaccurate hits are severely penalized.
And if the field itself isn't dark enough, Michelson in his sixth game on Sunday will be battling the exact British Open champion France Malinara, who together with Tommy Flywood won all four games this week.
If the Americans, who are left for four points in the first 12 singles matches, start with success, the Michelson match can prove to be extremely important.
"Furyk expressed confidence in this player, but couldn't say anything else.
"He fully understood his role today, clapped me in the back, prepared and said that he would be ready tomorrow," Furick said.
“He’s very confident in himself.
He was admitted to the Hall of Fame and gave a lot of teams last week and this week.
Maybe I didn't make it to two games.
I wanted to play more, but that's how I thought I was going to play.
He wants to be on the field, just like everyone else.”
Michaelsen will break Nick Fald's record for the number of Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
This could be the end of a career in the Ryder Cup, which has never been the same as achievements in individual games.
Michaelsen won 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furick said his presence had benefited the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, humorous, he likes to joke about people, and he’s just a very good person who’s good at having a good team,” he explained.
“I think that more young players were happy to have his jokes dated this week, too, and it was good to see that.
He's giving the team a lot more than just a game."
The captain of the European team, Thomas Burns, knows that a major breakthrough can quickly disappear.
Thomas Byrne, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant break-up ahead of the last day's individual games at the Ryder Cup could easily disappear.
The Danish player made his debut in the 1997 game at Walderam, where the European team led by Seva Balesteras had a five-point lead over the Americans, but ended with a minimum of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You keep reminding yourself that in Walderam we had a great lead and we won, but with difficulty, we had a great lead in Brooklyn, where we lost," said Byrne on the 10th and after reviewing how the National team won the Class of 5 in 2018.
"History shows me and everyone else in the team that it's not the end yet.
Tomorrow we'll have to play 100.
Get out of the field and do everything right.
Until the points appeared in the table, nothing was finished.
We have a goal, and that's to try to win this trophy, that's what we're going to focus on.
"I'm constantly saying this, I'm focusing on 12 players on our side, but we understand very well that on the opposite side there are the best players in the world."
Satisfied with how his players played on a heavy golf course, Burn added: "I will never overestimate myself in this.
Tomorrow will be a completely different game.
There will be a game tomorrow, and that's quite different.
It's just great if you're on the field with a partner and everything goes well, but if you're playing alone, then here are your true talents of golfer.
Here's what you need to give to the players that they have to show the best tomorrow.
Now we have to leave the partner, the wells have to go and also show everything the best as an individual player."
Unlike Burns, his rival, Jim Furick, hopes for a better individual play of his athletes than the one they demonstrated in the partnership, with the exception of Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas.
Furick himself was on both sides of these last day's matches, playing in the winning team in Brooklyn and losing when Europe had a "City in the Middle."
"I remember every word of it," he said, responding to a question about how Ben Cranshaw, the 1999 captain, set his players up for the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important games, but we always want to have a quick start that you saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
When the speed increases, the greatest pressure is put on those who play the matches in the middle.
"We've made the schedule and put the players in the way we liked it. You know, tomorrow we're going to try to get some magic."
Thomas was given the task to start playing back and play against Rory McKilroy in the main game, and Paul Casey, Justin Roosevelt, John Ram, Tommy Flywood and John Paulter will play against top golfers.
"I've put my players in that order because I think I'm going to close everything like that," Bryan said of his choice for individual matches.
The launch of a new German warship has been postponed.
The new fleet of the German Navy should have been put into operation in 2014 to replace the old warships during the Cold War, but it will not appear before next year due to the inadequate systems and steadily increasing knowledge.
The descent of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the main ship of the completely new class of the Baden-Wuerttemberg frigates, was postponed until the first half of 2019, the newspaper Die Zeit wrote, citing a military representative.
The ship was supposed to be in operation in 2014, but the problems that emerged after the construction hindered this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class warships, ordered in 2007, are to replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
They will be armed with strong guns, various anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles, as well as some “steles” technologies, such as reduced visibility for radars, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Among other important features – longer periods between maintenance – more new freighters may not go into their ports for up to two years.
However, permanent suspensions mean that modern warships – which can allow Germany to demonstrate its power outside the country – will become obsolete until they finally get into shape, Die Zeit notes.
The unhappy F125 fell to the headline last year when the German Navy officially refused to accept the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
For the first time, the Navy returned the ship to the ship after delivery.
The reason for the return is little known, but German media have written about many "software defects and equipment" that make the ship useless in a battle mission.
The shortcomings of the software were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships had only 120 sailors – half of the crew of the old Bremen-class frigates.
It has also been found that the ship has a very large weight, which reduces its performance and limits the possibility of further upgrades.
The Rhineland-Palatinate weighs 7,000 tons, which is twice the weight of ships of the same class that Germany used in World War II.
In addition to the missing equipment, the cost of the entire project – including the training of the crew – also becomes a problem.
The price reached an incredible <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0x24>3.6 billion) – although initially amounted to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems accumulated with the new frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is diminishing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee in the German parliament, said that the Navy "has fewer ships capable of military missions."
He said the problem is growing over time, as the old ships are being shipped, and the ships are not being replaced.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were able to join the Navy.
The National Society for the Conservation of Monuments has listened to the secret lives of the
A new study, which is being conducted in the Scottish Mountains, is aimed at finding out how the landscape is said to be used in hunting for food.
Students hope to find something new in the behaviors of unique flying dairy feeders and help in future actions to preserve these animals.
The study of scholars of Scotland's National Society for the Conservation of Monuments is conducted by small squirrels and also by the long-distance squirrels of Dabanton in Inver's gardens in Western Rose.
Special recording devices will be placed in the main locations of this location in order to monitor the activities of the monkeys throughout the season.
Employees and volunteers will be conducting mobile research with the use of handheld detectors.
The expert analysis of the sounds of all recordings determines the frequency of calls to the speakers, as well as what they are told to do.
The residence map and the report will be used to create a detailed picture of the behavior of these animals in this landscape.
Rob Duar, a consultant to the National Society for Conservation of Nature, hopes that the results will show which areas are most important to the caterpillars and how each species uses them.
This information will help to determine the advantages of creating habitats such as ponds, and how to support forests for the livelihood of monkeys and other animals associated with them.
The number of refugees in Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined considerably over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work, which affects the place of residence and destroys them.
Wind turbines and lighting can be risky, as well as adhesive tapes for flies and some chemicals for building materials. They are also threatened by domestic cats.
They are not blind at all.
However, because of their nightlife, the ears of the speakers are more sensitive than the eyes when it comes to hunting.
They use a sophisticated start-up technique to detect bugs and obstacles along the way.
The National Society, which is responsible for more than 270 buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land all over the country, is very serious about sayings.
It employs ten skilled experts, who regularly conduct research, checks of places of residence and, sometimes, rescue activities.
The organization even created the first and only Scottish caterpillar heritage in the town of Troy in Dumfries and Galway, where eight out of ten species of caterpillars live in Scotland.
Chief of Staff David Thompson says it's an ideal area for sayers.
"Here in Troy, we just have a great place to say," he said.
“We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and a very good place to live.
But we still don't know much about the sayings, so our work here and in other masters will help us understand more about what they need for a better life."
It emphasizes the importance of checking for the presence of ants before repairing the property, as it is possible to inadvertently destroy one seat, killing up to 400 males and young ants, which will lead to the complete destruction of the location.
They are under protection and are forbidden to kill, scare, disturb, or destroy their sediments.
Elizabeth Faral, an employee of the Scottish Coalition Protection Organization, is calling on the public to help in this matter.
She says, “We still have a lot to learn about our sayings, and we don’t even know how many of the species live in their populations.”
Ranaldo is accused of rape, and his lawyers are going to go to court for a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has been accused of raping him as “fake news” by saying that people want to “advertise themselves” using his name.
His lawyers are going to be brought to court for the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published these allegations.
Forward of Portugal and Juventus was charged with rape of the American woman Catherine Major in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He then seemed to pay her <0x24>375,000 for silence, Der Spiegel wrote on Friday.
In an Instagram Live video, 33-year-old Ronaldo turned to 142 million of his subscribers just hours after the allegations were released, calling this a “fake news” post.
“No, no, no, no, no.
Today’s messages are fake news,” said the five-time owner of the Golden Ball in front of the camera.
“They want to advertise on my behalf.
That's okay.
They want to be known by mentioning my name, but it's part of my work.
I am a happy and kind man,” he added with a smile.
Ranaldo's lawyers are preparing a case against Der Spiegel on charges they have called "an inadmissible report of suspicions in a private case," according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Shertz said the player will seek compensation for "marital damages in the amount corresponding to the severity of the violation of rights, and in recent years this may be the most serious violation of personal rights."
It was as if the incident took place in June 2009 in the suite room of the Palms Houtley and Cassinos hotel in Las Vegas.
Meeting at a nightclub, Ranaldo and Majorga seemed to return to the soccer player's room, where he appeared to have raped her anal, as written in Clark County District Court documents.
Majorga claims that after that he included Ranaldo and said that at “99 percent” he was “a good guy” who suffers from “one percent”.
The documents state that Ronaldo admitted that they had sex, but according to the consent of the parties.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and took pictures of the injuries in the hospital, but then agreed to a substantive settlement because she was “very afraid of revenge” and worried that she was “publicly impoverished”.
A 34-year-old woman says she now wants to reclaim the charge because she feels a moral trauma for the case.
At a time when this was the case, Ranaldo was about to move to Madrid’s Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he moved to Italy’s Juventus, closing the deal for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: Britain 'forever regrets' the loss of car makers
The UK will "forever regret" the loss of its status as a global automotive leader after Brexit, business minister Greg Clarke said in a statement.
He added that his statement to the BBC by Toyota UK that if the UK leaves the EU without an agreement, the company would temporarily cut production at a factory in Barnston, where Derby did not fall by half.
“We need an agreement,” said Mr. Clarke.
Japan's automaker said the impact of a restraint on the border as a result of Brexit without a deal could lead to a cut in jobs.
The plant in Burnston, where Toyota Auris and Avensis are manufactured, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other European countries.
“In my view, if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our factory will stop,” said Marvin Cook, Toyota’s chief executive officer at Barnaby.
Other car makers in the UK raised the question of how to implement cross-border trade if the UK is to leave the EU without an agreement. Among them Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, has announced that it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is the fact that automakers are talking about the risk of supply chains as a result of Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota’s production line is based on “exactly on time” when spare parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the UK and in the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29, there may be victories on the border that will lead to a deprivation and shortage of parts.
For Toyota, it will be impossible to keep a stockpile of parts at the Derby plant for more than a day, the company said, so production will stop.
Mr. Clark said that Theresa May's "Plan of Checkers" on future EU relations was "designed precisely to avoid these checks at the borders."
"We need an agreement. We want to get the best deal that will not only allow today's success, but also allow us to take advantage of this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4.
“The information we receive, not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, suggests that we should be able to continue the work of successful supply chains.”
Toyota has not been able to report how long the production will not work, but has warned in the future that the added cost will reduce the plant's competitiveness and will lead to job cuts.
Peter Tuvalares, who has been working in Burnston for 24 years and is the coordinator of the union, said that the union members are very concerned: "In my experience, if jobs are cut, they will not be renewed.
The Prime Minister said: “We have proposed a precise plan of our future relations with the EU that deserves trust.”
The White House says Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again
A very important meeting between Donald Trump and Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed for another week,” while the fight around the candidate in the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is studying interference on the part of Russia, the relations of Trump's aides with Russia, and a potential obstruction of justice on the part of the president.
Releasing Trump's Assistant Attorney General or not, and thus jeopardizing Mueller's independence, she has been burning oil on Washington's airplanes for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of taking a hidden microphone to record conversations with Trump, and the possibility of withdrawing the president from office with the help of 25 motions.
Roosevelt has done it.
But on Monday, he went to the White House in the middle of rumors that he was going to be deposed.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting would be held on Thursday with Trump, who was at the United Nations headquarters in New York at the time.
Trump said he "doesn't want" to release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid clashes at a hearing in the Senate legal committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused Kabul spoke.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, which further slowed the vote in the Senate.
Trump's secretary of state, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "The date is not yet scheduled, maybe this week, maybe next. I think that, more likely, a week later, taking into account all the other things that you have.
But it's going to happen, and I'm always giving the press the latest information."
Some journalists are ready to challenge her assertion: Sanders hasn't been holding briefings for the press in the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked her why when she was running the program.
Sanders said that the rarity of briefings was caused not to be disrespectful to television journalists who "work in public", although she added, "I agree with the fact that they work in public."
She then said that Trump's direct contact with the press would increase.
"The president holds more meetings with the answers to the press questions than any president who has ever been to him," she said, adding without concrete facts: "We have studied these numbers."
The briefings are taking place, Sanders said, but "if the press has a chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it's much better than doing it through me.
We're trying to do it often, you've seen how we've done it in the last few weeks. Those meetings where you can ask the question directly to the president, replace the briefings."
Trump regularly responds to questions about whether he is leaving the White House or taking part in street meetings, or at press conferences with high-ranking foreign guests.
The president's press conferences are rarely held.
This week, in New York City, the president demonstrated why, when free and sometimes extravagant, he appeared in front of reporters.
The Minister of Health has written to employees from EU countries in Scotland's health care system before Brexit.
The Minister of Health wrote to EU workers working in Scotland's health care system to express his gratitude on behalf of the country and wish them to stay after Brexit.
Jane Freeman has sent a letter less than six months before Britain's departure from the EU.
The Scottish government is already ready to cover the cost of residence applications from EU citizens working in the country's public services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "In the summer, negotiations have continued between the UK and the EU on the exit of our country. They lead to the expected decisions this autumn.
But the British government has also accelerated preparations for the scenario without an agreement.
I know this is a very unpleasant time for all of you.
That's why I want to remind you how much I appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of his nationality.
My colleagues from all EU countries, and not only, provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, but also benefit patients and our communities.
“Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay with us.”
Christian Abercrombie has undergone an emergency surgery after a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers team linebacker Christian Abercrombie has undergone an emergency surgery after he suffered a head injury in a Sunday match that his team lost to 31-27 Vanderbilt Commodores.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Ridd told reporters that the player had suffered a trauma shortly before the break.
“He went to the sideline and suddenly fell,” Reed said.
Coaches and doctors continued abercombi oxygen on the field before placing it on the stool and moving to make a diagnosis.
A Tennessee State spokesman told Chris Harris of the WSMV radio station in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been relocated to the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there was no “detail about what the trauma was,” and Tennessee State were trying to figure out if the player had been injured.
Abercomby, a second-grade sportsman, spends the first season for Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he made five full breaks, giving only 18 breaks per season.
Foreign buyers of British real estate will pay a higher fee.
According to the new plan of conservatives, foreign buyers of British real estate will pay a higher tax, and the additional money will go to help the homeless.
This action neutralizes the success of Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters.
Increased taxation will apply to those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Ministry of Finance plans to receive up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year for help from homeless people
Today, Theresa May announced that foreign buyers of British real estate will pay a higher government fee, and the additional money will go to the help of the homeless.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's initiative of attracting young voters, as well as the now available housing. It is aimed at people with high incomes.
The increase in the state tax is aimed at individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK, and the money received will go to the government's housing donation program for the homeless.
Increasing the current state tax, including higher levels, adopted two years ago, on the purchase of second homes and housing for rent, can cost up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance is expected to receive up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
Approximately 13 percent of new buildings in London are purchased by non-residents in the UK, which leads to higher prices and new buyers are making it difficult to buy their first home.
Many rich regions of the country – especially the capital – have become “gardens-free” because a large number of buyers outside the borders do not live in the UK most of the time.
The new policy literally emerged a few weeks after Barry Johnson's call to cut the state tax on young buyers to ease the purchase of the first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high prices for real estate through land seizure and non-use of the land, and urged Mrs. May to cancel the quotas on the available housing to send a "humiliating housing"
Mr. Corbin announced a wave of housing reforms, including leasing control and halting "unreasonable" evictions.
He also wants to give more power to the local council in the field of housing construction.
“Last year, I announced that I would dedicate my work as Prime Minister to the restoration of the British dream – life should be made better for every new generation,” May said.
This means that we are improving our inadequate housing market.
The UK will always be open to those who want to live, work, and build their lives here.
However, it's unfair that individuals who do not live in the UK and foreign companies can buy real estate as easily as the UK's working residents.
For too many people, the dream of having their own home becomes increasingly inaccessible, and the problem of the homeless remains very real."
Jack Ross: "My main ambition is to lead the Scottish team"
"Sanderland coach Jack Ross said his main ambition was to ever become a coach for the Scottish team.
The 42-year-old Scottish performs the task of restoring the club from the northeast, which is now third in the First League, three points from the first.
He moved on to this job in the summer, after returning to St. Mary's in the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
But it didn't work out," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“I grew up, often sick for Scotland at the Hampton Stadium with my father, and something always made me come back.
But that's the way it will be when I'm a successful club coach."
Among Rosa's predecessors in the role of coach "Senderland" Dick Advocate, David Moises, Sam Alardais, Martin O'Neill, Roy King, Gus Poe and Paul Di Canyon.
Former Aloe Athletic coach says he was not afraid of such famous names in such a big club, having previously rejected proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Now the success for me will be the answer to the question, 'Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?'"
"According to the structure and material base of the club, his place is probably in the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not just going to get him back there, but I’ll only consider my work successful if I can get the club back there.”
Ross only worked as a coach for three years, before that he was an assistant coach at Dumbarton and worked for 15 months at the Harts coaching headquarters.
He then helped Aloe come back from the third league and turned San Mirren from a failure, which almost fell to the Champions League as the winner of the following season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlpool, Falkirk, Saint-Marin and Hamilton Academic.
Recalling his work at Aloa, he said, "This was a really important choice."
"I really believed that coaching is what I need, even more than a game.
It sounds amazing because I've worked well, earned well, and reached a certain height.
But the game can be difficult.
There are a lot of things to do every week.
I'm still going through this when I'm talking about stress and stress, but coaching is what you need.
I've always wanted to train and I'm doing this now, and for me it's the best time of my adult life."
The full interview can be heard on Sportsound on Saturday, September 30 at Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 British Summer Time.
According to research, the perfect time to drink a pint of beer – 17:30 on Saturday
The hot summer has increased the profits of British farmers who are struggling for survival, but has put pressure on the network of restaurants.
According to the statistics of the group of bars and pubs, sales grew by 2.7 percent in July, but in restaurants sales decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of CGA's advisory business group8, which compiled this statistic, said: "The sunny weather is going on and longer than expected, the English team's participation in the finals of the World Championships is going to mean that the competition is going to last longer than expected.
Reduced sales in restaurants by 1.8 percent in June, only deteriorated in July.
The bars and bars, which mainly sell drinks, have shown the best result unlike the restaurants.
The ones that sell more food are also sunshine, although not as strong as restaurants.
It looks like people just want to drink.
In bars and bars, the sales of beverages grew by 6.6 percent, and the sales of food fell by three percent."
Paul Neumann, RSM analyst on recreation and placement, said: “These results are the trends we’ve seen since the end of April.
The climate and impacts of important social and sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to the volumes of sales in the public food market.
It's no surprise that restaurants continue to compete, as sales dropped by 4.8 percent per year, and it's very unpleasant when prices are constantly rising.
The long and hot summer has come at the most crappy time for food-focused operators, and the time will show whether the lower temperatures in August will bring such an expected relief."
Overall sales growth in restaurants and pubs, including the recently opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand deployment.
A sales tracking tool in British pubs, bars and restaurants, the Coffer Peach Tracker collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups with a total range of <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and is an important one.
One in five children has a secret account on social media that they hide from their parents.
The study found that one in five children – some of them only 11 – have secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents and teachers.
Study of 20,000 high school students showed the growth of "feeling Insta" pages
It's a panic-stricken news that there's sexual content there.
Twenty percent of students said they had a “basic” account that they showed to their parents.
One in five children – some of them only 11 – create accounts on social networks that they keep secret from their parents.
Studying 20,000 high school students found the rapid growth of “feeling Insta” accounts – which seem to lead to Instagram’s photo sharing site.
It's a panic-stricken news that sexual content is being published there.
Twenty percent of the students said they had "clean" "core" accounts to show their parents, and they also had private accounts.
One mother, who accidentally found a secret site for her 13-year-old daughter, learned that she had called on others to “violete me.”
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors of Independent Schools (HMC) found that 40 percent of adolescents aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having secret credentials.
HMC CEO Mike Buchanan said: “It’s very worrying that so many teenagers want to create places on the internet where neither parents nor teachers can find them.”
Eileen Doyle Will Be ‘Sportsman’s Vote’ in Scottish Athletics Council
Eileed Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Council as a supervisory member of the council at the annual general meeting of this body.
Doyle is Scotland's most respected lightweight athletic and senior Ian Biece has described this event as a great opportunity for those who run sports to benefit from her experiences at a wide variety of levels, including:
"Eilid is highly respected in Scotland, the UK and the world sports community, and we are confident that light athletics in Scotland will get a lot of benefit from its work in the council," B said.
Doyle said: "I want to act as a voice of athletes and I hope to help drive sports in Scotland."
The American who won gold at distances of 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and two gold medals at other Olympics, and who now works as an expert on the BBC, can't walk after he's survived.
He tweeted, “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell me whether or not I'm going to go to what extent.
It was a hard job, but I've completely recovered, learned to walk again and now I'm doing exercises in Algeria!
“Thank you for your support for the message!”
Advertising a milk pump, where mothers are compared to cows, shared opinions on the internet
The company for the production of milk pumps has shared opinions, releasing an advertisement that compares breastfeeding women with breastfeeding cows.
To mark the launch of what is called the “world’s first supervised milk pump,” consumer company Elvie released an Iranian music advertisement based on a video to show the freedom this device gives to the nursing mothers.
Four real mothers are dancing in a chorus with caroles under the song, where there are the words, “Yes, I give myself, but I don’t have the honour” and “In case you haven’t noticed, it’s not a wash, it’s my breasts.”
And he said, Yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, I will give my wives.
However, the ad, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, sparked a hot discussion on the internet.
77,000 views and hundreds of comments. The reaction to the video was inconsistent, many said it was a terrible milk production.
"It's a very difficult decision to use penalties to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to load and give birth to give milk, it’s only their children pick up in a few days,” wrote one viewer.
Elvie's milk pump is hidden in the breastfeeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: “I understand it is traumatic for both the mother and the child.
But why not use them to advertise milk pumps for mothers who don’t have children?”
Someone added, "That's such an unthinkable advertisement."
Others defended the advertisement, and one woman wrote that they considered the song “fun”.
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I'd love to have one if I had a breast.
Having a baby's milk makes me feel like I'm pregnant.
It's a little crazy, but I liked it.
“It’s a great product,” she wrote.
Another comment: “Very entertaining advertising aimed at mothers who absorb milk pumps (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feel themselves ‘carousing’.
This advertising does not endorse or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women shows that they were all dancing with invisible milk pumps hidden in bra.
The concept of an advertising company is based on the fact that many women who use dairy pumps feel like they're ugly.
However, the Elvie Pump pump is completely seamless, has no wires, no pipes and is immaculately hidden in breastfeeding bra, gives women freedom of movement, allows them to keep their children and even get out of work.
Ana Babari, partner and creative director at Mother, commented: “Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that deserves a clear and streamlined launch.
By establishing a parallel between nursing women and breastfeeding cows, we wanted to pay attention to the absorption of milk and its severity, while also demonstrating a fun and relaxing way, as a new breastfeeding pump adopts.
It's not the first time Elvie's milk pump has become the center of attention.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the podium in the clothes of Martha Yakubovsky, using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children are being transported to a tent camp on the Texas border without excessive noise
Although the number of border crossings in a month has barely changed, the sharp increase in the number of migrant children detained is partly due to the harsh rhetoric and politics that the Trump administration has carried out.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors are illegal immigrants, who are anxious to put their own residence in the country at risk, taking responsibility for the child.
Risks increased considerably in June, when the federal authorities announced that a potential sponsor and other under-age member of the household will need to pass the fingerprints and the data will be passed on to the immigration authority.
Last week, Matty Albens, a high-ranking employee of the Immigration and Customs Service, spoke to the Congress with a report on the archaeology of the agency of dozens of people who have contacted with a request to sponsor unauthorized flights.
It was later reported that 70% of the detainees had no jurisdiction.
"About 80 percent of people who are sponsors or members of their households are illegally located in the country, and a significant proportion of them are foreigners with a criminal background.
That’s why we continue to pursue such people,” said Mr. Olbens.
For the faster processing of children, officials have introduced new rules, which require some to appear in court within a month from the date of detention, because, according to the workers of reception, the previous standard term was 60 days.
A large number of people will have to make use of video connections to file an application for their own legal status to an immigration judge, rather than attending the court in person.
Those who don't have the right to help will be deported quickly.
According to the workers received and a message from sources in the system that have appeared in the last months, the longer the children remain in dismissal, the higher the likelihood of the emergence of depression or the increase in the risk of depression or discomfort.
Attorneys state that in larger institutions such as Tornilla, these problems are found to be much more severe, as the signs that the child is in good condition are more likely to be ignored due to the size of the facility.
They add that moving the children to a tent town without providing time for emotional preparation or to say goodbye to friends can exacerbate the trauma that many have already faced.
Syria calls for immediate withdrawal of the US, France and Turkey's "occupied forces"
In a call to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home despite the war that continues in the country for the eighth year.
Mualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are on the Syrian soil illegally, based on the fight against terrorism, and "will be dealt with accordingly".
"They have to leave immediately and without any conditions," he said at the sitting of the Assembly.
Mualem insisted that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and a million people have been forced to leave their homes, “the war on terrorism is almost over.”
He said Damascus intends to “continue this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territories” from both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence,” according to the Syrian government.
In Syria, there are about 2,000 U.S. troops, mainly instructors and advisers of Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces, who are in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France's land contingent in this devastated war-torn country consists of more than 1,000 soldiers.
On the question of refugees, Mualem said the conditions for return were favorable and accused "some western countries" of "spreading the Iranian fears" that contain refugees abroad.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to enforce their return," he said.
"They're politicizing an exclusively humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not be assisted in the restoration until a political agreement on ending the war is reached between Assad and the opposition.
The U.N. diplomats reported that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone in the last major Idlib rebel support has created an opportunity for ongoing political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has prevented a large-scale offensive of Syrian forces backed by Russia against the province, which is home to three million people.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement had "exact terms", and expressed the hope that the military actions will be directed against the jihadists, including the warriors from the "Al-Qaeda"-related front of the "Nusra"
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first sessions of the new committee, which will include representatives of the government and the opposition, in order to develop a constitution for Syria and to declare a resolution.
Mualem expressed the conditions of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, stating that the work of the commission should be limited to "revising the articles of the current constitution" and warn of interference.
Why Trump's going to the second term
According to this logic, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 election if, as many liberal viewers hope, the impeachment and the deadly scandal do not end his presidency.
And this, without a doubt, will be “The very dramatic finale of the presidency throughout history!”
At the moment, there are no signs of tiredness.
Since 2014, the ratings have increased more than twice – to 1.05 million on CNN and almost three times – to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averaged 2.4 million spectators in the first-time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and the broadcast "The Rachel Maddow Show" channel MSNBC collected 3.5 million spectators on the screen.
"It's a fire that people are drawn to because we don't understand it," said Neil Barr, director of ABC's drama "The Rebellion" about a member of the Cabinet of Ministers who becomes president after the attack that destroyed the Capitol.
In Neal Scowell, a mastiff scriptwriter and author of the book "A couple of funny details and some hard truths about penetrating into the club of Galway boys," there is a different theory.
She recalls a taxi ride to Boston before the 2016 election.
The president told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
He replied, “Because he’s entertaining me,” Mrs. Scowell told me.
Chaos is even more valuable than it can be.
Of course, unlike the rest of television, the plot lines that come out of Washington, D.C. can become as definite a future as the case of "Row vs. Wade" depends on whether or not it will be able to play.
Ignorance is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, if you watch the sixth hour of the day, it's as simple as a group of experts discussing the use of Bob Woodward's "information not for printing" in the book "Fear", the jacket of Paul Manafort for <0x24>15,000, the course of the Washington, as a "sweet"
For example, I'm never going to look at Super Mario as I used to.
"Part of what he does makes you feel like you're looking at a reality show he's demonstrating every night," says Brenton Montgomery, executive director of "Wheelhouse Story" and "Pawn Star" songwriter.
You can't afford to miss even one episode, otherwise you'll stay away from the trend.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleas this week, behind the windows of his house on the north coast of Kawai stood a bright sunny day and 30 degrees of warmth, but he sat inside and watched MSNBC, while CN recorded.
He couldn't have succeeded, not even when Brett Kavanaugh stood before the Senate Judicial Committee, discussing the future of the Supreme Court, which was hanging on the hair.
“I remember the girls when we released these crazy shows, and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Fleas told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

External cash flows are being put into a tough election race for the midterm elections in the House of Representatives
Not surprisingly, the 17th Pennsylvania constituency has been covered by a cash loot due to a change in the boundaries of the constituencies introduced by the Congress, for which two candidates participate in the elections for one seat.
The newly redesigned district of Pittsburgh is surrounded by a Democrat, a member of the House of Representatives Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another county in the elections last spring.
Lembou is opposed by another acting deputy, Republican Kit Rothfuss, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which largely coincides with the new 17th.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January found that the votes of the old districts were unconstitutionally counted in favor of the Republicans.
The pre-election race in the new 17th district caused a decline in the company's funding by the main party financial groups, the Committee of the Congress of the Democratic Company (CDC) and the National Committee of the Republican Company (CRC).
Lamb became famous in Pennsylvania after a difficult victory in a wide-ranging election in the 18th District of Pennsylvania in March.
This place has been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump has won in the county with a 20-point break.
Political analysts point out that there are few advantages to the Democrats.
The U.S. has assessed the possibility of El Salvador's punishment for China's support, and then resigned
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already supported Beijing's position, despite the slight opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and stayed at a hotel in Panama until his partners relocated the Trump leadership team.
Representatives of the State Department have decided to recall the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama in connection with the "recent news" decisions on the non-recognition of Taiwan.
However, the sanctions were only considered in relation to El Salvador, which received about <0x24>140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including control over the range of drugs, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which include a reduction in financial assistance and targeted restrictions on visa issuance, would be painful for the Central American country with its high level of unemployment and murders.
As the internal meetings were completed, the representatives of North and Central America postponed the holding of the conference at a high level, dedicated to security and economic prosperity, which would continue to be an analogous to the cold.
But by mid-September, senior officials of the administration continued to understand that they wanted the conference to take place and actually stopped considering the issue of El Salvador's punishment.
According to the diplomats, Vice-President Mike Pension is now speaking at the conference scheduled for mid-October, in a sign that the administration is in favour of conducting the event.
And three American envoys without excessive noise returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh envoys or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman, Mr. Bolton, declined to comment on the details of the debates described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss domestic issues during the debate.
Their messages are confirmed by other, close to the administration analysts, who also wanted to remain anonymous.
Let's learn the history
The next step could be a report by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on a possible obstruction to Mr. Trump's judiciary, examples of which are currently very difficult evidence in public documents.
It is reported that Mr. Mueller drew attention in the investigation to the possibility of the Trump-Russia campaign in an election attack.
If the Congress changes the host, Mr. Trump will be held accountable to this body, just as he is preparing to speak again before the voters, and, perhaps, in the end, before the president of his office.
There are a lot of "calls" and I don't want to say that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, just like his in Europe.
We all, on both sides of the Atlantic, have to make a choice that determines how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officials were ready for a state coup against Hitler, if only the West had given him opposition and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We have failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the bleedings of the next few years.
The story revolves around such moments of tumult, and the irreversible march of democracy is delayed or delayed.
At the moment, the Americans have faced some of these moments.
What will happen if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since the time in Gaza was written about the fact that last year he proposed to secretly write down the president's words and reflected on his incompetence.
Mr. Rosenstein says the transfer of "The Times" is inaccurate.
"How will we respond if the recently requested FBI investigation into the case of Bret Kavan is not all-pervasive or fair, or if it is endorsed by the Supreme Court, in spite of the trustworthiness of the defendant?
And, first of all, are we going to vote for Congress, which will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we don't go through these tests, there will be a long winter for democracy.
But I don't think we'll be able to make it through the lessons I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Hebrew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, immigrated to America and after 60 years sent me to light the Sabbath candles on this table with swastika.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorans from Rangers optimistic on the day before the match with Raid Vienna
The Rangers are taking the Vienna Ride on Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians after an impressive night in Spain over the Villarreal at the beginning of this month will allow them to leave the group Ghia.
Knee injury prevented semi-defensive Graham Dorans for the first time in the season to play 2-2 with the Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers will be able to take advantage of this result as a trampoline.
"It was a significant match for us because Villarreal is a strong opponent," the 31-year-old said.
“We started the game thinking we could get something, and we made a point.
Maybe we could have killed the ball at the end, but at the end of the night, too, was a good result.
They looked better at the first time, but in the second we took our hands, and we had the best half of the field.
On Thursday, there will be another important night for the European football team.
I hope we can earn three points, but it's going to be a complicated game, as they've shown a good result in the last game, but considering the crowd of fans on the platforms, I'm sure we'll be able to cope with them.
Last year was definitely a hard one, both because of my injuries and the change in the club itself, but now we have a factor of confidence.
The team is good, and the guys really get the pleasure of the game; the training is productive.
I hope we can move forward, move forward with the result of last season and succeed.”
Women are losing sleep because of fear of retirement accumulation.
Despite the fact that the respondents had an accurate idea of what they wanted to care for themselves, few of them talked about it with their family members.
Approximately half of the people who participated in the general national survey said they had been talking to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked about it with their children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but don’t take steps to discuss it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Life Insurance at Nationwide.
Here's where to start.
Remember this with your husband and children: your family won't be ready to help you if you don't make your wishes come true in advance.
Work with the counselor and family and discuss where and how to get medical help, as this choice can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Invite to discuss the financial advisor. he can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your choice of financing for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy that will help cover these expenses, or you can insure yourself that you are insured.
Resolve cases with legal documents: Foresee judicial battles.
Gain trust in the medical service to assign a trusted person to control your medical service and ensure that the specialists perform your wishes in the event that you can't speak up.
In addition, consider the possibility of issuing trust in the management of finances.
Identify a trusted person to make financial decisions and ensure that you pay your bills if you're incapacitated.
Don't forget about the details: imagine that your father-in-law needs urgent medical attention, and he's on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer any questions about the use of anti-inflammatory drugs and allergies?
Set up these details in writing in order to be ready to be done.
“Not only financial issues have a role to play, but also the professionalism of doctors,” adds Martin.
“What medications are needed?
Who's going to take care of the dog?
“We have to plan everything.”
In Ilfracombe, a man was shot several times with a pneumatic windshield

The 40-year-old was in the Oxford-Grow district of Ilfracombe, Devon County, when he was shot in the chest, thigh and arm.
Police officers described the shooting, which occurred at about 2:30 p.m. local time, as a “accidental incident”.
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, the police ask a witness to contact them.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
According to officials, at least 384 people were killed as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and the number of deaths is expected to increase.
Due to the disconnection of communication, humanitarian workers were unable to obtain any information from the Dongal Regency, the area north of the Pole, which is closest to the epicenter of the 7th earthquake.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongal on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi island, with a population of 379,800 people for 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami occurred, the city celebrated the 40th anniversary of its founding.
Dongala is a regency that extends over more than 180 miles (300 km) of coastline on the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
Regentva is an administrative unit with status below the province, in 2017 there were 299,200 people.
Fisheries and farming are the main economies of the province of Central Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Dongal.
Nickel deposition is also important for the province, but mainly concentrated in Moravia, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Agency for the Mitigation of the Consequences of Civil Disasters, Palu and Dongal have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed in the tsunami in Dongal and hundreds of homes were destroyed.
The tsunami also struck the western part of Dongal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is in a seismic-active Pacific fire ring, and it is regularly excavated by earthquakes.
Below is a list of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A severe earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Acheh in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that swept through 14 countries, resulting in more than 2,000 floods along the coast of the Indian Ocean.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes erupted on the western coast of Sumatra in late March-early April.
Hundreds of people have died on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake occurred south of Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coastline, killing about 700 people.
2009: In the city of Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province, an earthquake of 7.6 points occurred.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-point earthquake occurred on one of the islands of Mentavia outside Sumatra, causing tsunamis up to 10 meters, which devastated dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake hit the Pidi Jaya Regency in Achieh Province, causing riots and panic as it reminded people of the landing as a result of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
This time, there were no tsunamis, but more than 100 people died under the ruins of buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lambock, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the north of the island.
The earthquake has destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists without the opportunity to leave.

At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-point earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and networks are not working, and the number of casualties is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near central Sulawesi, which is located in the northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
On social media, there are video clips that show the moment of the attack.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
The federal prosecutor's office demands a rare death sentence for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York
The federal prosecutor's office in New York is demanding the death penalty for Syful Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York, which killed eight people - a rare sentence that was not used in the state for 19 years.
Saipov, 30 years old, in October allegedly used a pickup truck of the company "Home Depot" for a ride on a cycling trail along the West Side road in Lower Manhattan, beating pedestrians and pedestrians.
In order to justify the death sentence, according to the announcement of the intention to achieve the death penalty, filed in the South District of New York, the prosecutor must prove that Saipov was "invented" and killed in a row.
According to the court's records, for both offences a possible penalty in the form of a death penalty is possible.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal prosecutor of the jury was accused of imposing an indictment of 22 points, which included eight indictments in the murder case, the prosecution of the missile; the prosecution of this case.
According to the prosecutors, the attack required “old and intentional planning,” and describing the crimes committed by Saipav, used such phrases as “aggressive, harsh and destructive”.
"Saifula Habibulaevich Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleveland, Anna Lorraine Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Earl, and Ariel Earl."
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It's been ten years since the last criminal case was filed in the form of a death penalty in New York City's Southern District.
Prosecutor Halid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty in New York City on a federal case was applied in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple sentenced after they were sentenced two years earlier to be convicted of conspiracy with the purpose.
A couple of Rosenbergs were punished on an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an exit from Uzbekistan, according to court documents, demonstrated a lack of evidence of conscience in the days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigator that he was happy with his actions.
According to the accused, Saipov informed the authorities that the attack was inspired by the viewing of a video of the Islamic State on the phone.
He also asked permission to lift the flag of the Islamic State in the hospital's palace, the police said.
He does not plead guilty to the indictment, which consists of 22 paragraphs.
David Patan, one of the federal public defenders represented by Saipova, said they were "absolutely disappointed" by the decision of the prosecutor's office.
“We believe that the decision to apply the death penalty, rather than life imprisonment without the possibility of release, will only prolong the pain of these events for all participants,” said Patan.
The Defence Team of Saipova had previously called on prosecutors not to face the death penalty.
A member of parliament from Thora says that Nigel Farage should be nominated for Brexit negotiations.
Today, during a protest at the Tory party conference, Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the People's Army".
Former Ukip leader said politicians should “feel discomfort” from Eurosceptics as one of the MPs, Theresa May, proposed his candidacy for negotiations with the EU.
A member of parliament from the Conservative Party, Peter Boone, said during a march in Birmingham that Britain would already “go out” if Mr. Farage held the post of secretary for Brexit.
But the problem that Mrs. May faced while trying to match her dissident supporters got even worse when the Thors, who are in favor of maintaining EU membership, staged a separate protest against Brexit in the country.
The prime minister is trying with all his strength to maintain a consistent Checker Agreement under constant pressure from supporters and outgoing workers, as well as the EU itself.
The Allies insist on attempts to negotiate with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and want to force Eurosceptics and labourers to choose between its package and the “missing”.
Mr. Boone said at a rally in Salihal, "Leave Means Leave," that he wants to "take Chuck out of the board."
He proposed that Mr. Faraday be made equal and set up responsibilities for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been responsible, we would have gone out,” he said.
A member of parliament from Wellingboro added: “I’m for Brexit, but we need to move away from Checker’s plan.”
Speaking against the EU, he said: “We have not waged world wars to be dependent.
We want to enforce our own laws in our country.”
Mr. Boone rejected the assumption that public opinion had changed after the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is not entirely in line with reality.”
A Brexit supporter and a member of Thora, Andrea Jenkins was also on the march, and in an interview with journalists, she said, "I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Checker's plan is unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is unpopular with our party and the activists who actually go out to the streets and take us to the streets.
"Please give up the plan and start listening."
In a sharp appeal to Ms. May, she added: "The prime ministers will remain in office if they keep their promises."
Farage said it was necessary for politicians to "feel discomfort" if they are going to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a question of trust between us – the people and the politicians,” he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, 'It's not going to get out of your hands.'
In his remarks to the crowd, he added: “I want you to force our politicians, who are ready to betray Brexit, to feel discomfort.
“We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country, which has given us victory in Brazil, and we will never be at peace until we become an independent, self-sufficient, proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, the exit workers passed through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city center.
Several activists have swapped the banners of Tories Against Brexit (Tories Against Brexit) after the group launched this weekend.
The Labour Party's Lord Adanis was scrambling over the conservatives on the occasion of the security issue they faced over the program for the party at the opening of the conference.
“These are people who tell us that they may be ready to use the IT system and all the technology for Canada plus, for border-free, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
"It's a full farce.
"There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to pay close attention to the process of debate on the position of President
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November elections, she would “return attention to the process of ratifying the presidency.”
The Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from the state of Massachusetts reported on Saturday about his future during a general rally in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is about to go to a re-election to oppose Republican Party member Jeff Dzil, who was the oldest Trump company in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was at the center of discussions as Trump's potential rival in 2020.
Since Trump's accession, this has been the 36th meeting with voters in the form of a general meeting that took place on Saturday in Khalifa.
One of the respondents asked if she was planning to take on the role of president.
Warren said it was time for “women to go to Washington to fix a broken government, and for this, a woman must stand up.”
The event took place after the death of basketball player Sims from the University of Louisiana team.
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police said on Saturday that the suspects in the murder of Basketball player Wade Sims were detained on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police have announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dylan Simpson during a press conference that took place at 11 a.m. Eastern time.
On Friday, they released a video of the shooting with a request to help identify the person who was depicted on it.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot dead on Friday morning near the South University campus.
"Wade Sims suffered a gunshot wound to his head as a result of which he died," police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on the 247sports channel on Saturday.
Wade pleaded for a friend and was shot by Simpson.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted that he was at the scene of the crime, was armed and shot at Wade Sims.
Simpson did not resist the arson and was detained in the police custody of the East Baton Rouge district.
A sportsman-junior growing 6 feet, 6 inches (201 cm) grew up in Baton Rouge, the Sims last season played in 32 games, of which at 10 was on the pitch from the start, averaging 17.6 out of 5,4 minutes.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world championship title after he won the victory over Sebastien Fetel on domestic cooperation.
From the moment Walter Bottas announced on Saturday at Lewis Hamilton's qualifying run, it became clear that the orders within the Mercedes team play a significant role in the race.
Bottas took a good place on the squad and almost left Hamilton on the will of fate, as he defended his place on the first two beliefs and invited Fetel to attack his friend on the team.
Fetel first went to the pit-stop and left Hamilton to swing at the end of the overall mass of riders, that is, this maneuver was supposed to be decisive.
"Mercedes" pilot went to a pit-stop on a lap later and left behind Fetel, but Hamilton went forward after several round-a-round maneuvers that forced the "Ferrari" driver to leave the interior space.
Max Ferstappen on his 21st birthday started from the back row of the net and was in seventh place until the end of the first round.
He then led most of the race until they held the tyres, because he wanted to finish quickly, to beat Kimi Rykanen and occupy fourth place.
As a result, he went to the pit-stop on the 44th round, but was unable to increase the speed in the other eight rounds, so Rykanen took fourth place.
It's been a tough day because Walter's all weekend performances are fantastic and he's been a real gentleman if I'm allowed to say that.
"The team has done a great job of taking the first and second place," said Hamilton.
It was, in fact, a bad body language.
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Diana Finchstein at a rally on Saturday because she insisted that it was not the source of the leaked letter of Christina Blaise Ford, in which she accused Bryant of being a victim.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's statements before the Senate Judicial Committee, instead commenting that what is happening in the Senate did not show how people can be "supported, submissive."
“The only thing that can happen, and the beautiful thing that’s happening in the last few days in the Senate, is when you see anger, when you see bad, deaf, and lying people,” he said.
“If you read about the press releases and the leaks, then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do that.
It's not me."
Do you remember?
Diana Finnstein, is this your escape?
Remember her answer... you lost the document – “Oh, oh, what?
No, no, no, no, no.
I didn't have anything."
Hold on a minute.
We allowed the escape... No, we didn’t,” he added, advising the senator.
Finstain sent a letter in July detailing the allegations made by Ford against Kavanaugh, and he ran away in early September – but Finstain denied that the flight took place from her office.
"I didn't hide the allegations of Dr. Ford, I didn't let her history run away," Finchstein told the committee.
“She asked for the story to remain confidential and I satisfies her request.”
But her rejection probably displeased the president, who so commented during the Saturday rally: "What I'm going to tell you, it was really a bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing the defense of a candidate in the Supreme Court, accused of sexual harassment by three women, the president has expressed the assumption that the Democrats are using the accusations for their own purposes.
“They are fully determined to restore themselves to power by any means.
You see the suburbs, the ugliness, and they don’t care who they hurt, through whom they have to cross to gain power and control,” the president’s statement read.
Elite League: Dandy Stars – Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer has scored two goals for the Giants in the match against Dundee.
Dundee Stars played for the Friday parade that the Belfast Giants faced in the Elite League, winning a 5-3 rebound game in the home game on Saturday.

Airplane driver dies after rescue of hundreds of passengers from earthquake
The aircraft controller in Indonesia was killed heroically, providing a successful flight of the aircraft with hundreds of passengers on board.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared without a trace after the massive earthquake on Sulawesi on Friday, which caused the tsunami.
Strong underground strikes are still ongoing, and many people are buried under the umbrellas in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues escaped, 21-year-old Antonio Gunavan Aguang refused to leave his position in the commanding school, which was wildly climbing at the airport of Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri.
He remained in place until the 6321 Batik Air, which was on the flight track at the time, crashed from the ground.
He then jumped up from the top of the board when he decided that it was going to break up.
He later died in the hospital.
According to the Australian program ABC News, according to representative of Air Navigation Indonesia, Johans Cyrita, the decision of the controller may have saved hundreds of lives.
We were preparing a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan, which was supposed to be transported to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning, before the helicopter flew to Paul.
“Our hearts are broken,” he added.
Meanwhile, the country's authorities are worried that the number of casualties could reach several thousand, and the agency to mitigate the risk of civil disasters claims that access to the cities of Dongal, Sigi and Button is restricted.
A spokesman for the agency Sutop Purva Nugroh said: “Perhaps the number of victims will continue to increase, as many bodies have not yet been able to recover from under the banners.”
The waves, which reached six meters, devastated Paula, where a mass funeral will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial jets are carrying humanitarian aid.
Rysa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the machine "fast" brings the targets.
It doesn't have clean water.
There are shops everywhere.”
Ian Gelfand, the head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help those who survived, but we don’t know what’s waiting for them here.
It's a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesian President Jock Vidoda arrived in Palu on Sunday and said: "I ask all of you to work day and night to end the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” said CNN.
Earlier this year in Indonesia, more than 550 people were killed by earthquakes in Lambok.
Air crash in Micronesia: According to "Air Niugini" one person passed without a message after crashing a plane in the lagoon
The airline, which carried out the flight, which carried out an emergency landing in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, has previously claimed that all 47 passengers and the team were happy to evacuate from the plane, which was hit, and now it's over.
The company "Air Niugini" said in a press release that, as of Saturday, it could not report on the location of one passenger-man.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately provide details about the passenger; for example, his age and nationality.
The local boats helped rescue the rest of the passengers and crew after the plane landed on the water in an attempt to land at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, officials said that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday; all of them were in stable condition.
The cause of the crash, as well as the exact sequence of events, remains unclear.
According to the airline and the U.S. Navy, the plane landed in the lagoon without flying to the passenger track.
According to some witnesses, the plane flew through the tracks.
According to American passenger Bill Janes, the plane flew very low.
“It’s very successful,” Janes said.
According to him, he and others were able to walk in the water to the emergency exits of the plane that he already knew.
He said that the pilots panicked and started screaming, as well as that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy reports that the brands that romanticized the non-defeated harbor also helped rescue, using an inflatable boat to transport people to shore until the aircraft landed at a depth of about 100 feet (30 feet).
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in the crash of aircraft registered in Papua New Guinea in the past 20 years, but none of them belonged to Air Niugini.
An analyst resumes the course of events at night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution completed the presentation of evidence in a review of the case of a man accused of burning a resident of the state of Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Roulette has for several hours given an indication as an attractive expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used cell phone records to identify the displacement of 29-year-old respondent Quintin Tallis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
According to The Clarion Ledger, according to Roulette, he received location information from several mobile phones, which showed that Tallis was with Chambers on the night of her death, contradicting his previous statement.
When the data that his mobile phone was next to Chambers' phone at the time, according to him, he was with his friend Michael Sanford confirmed, the police were headed to seek Sanford.
Sanford gave a statement on Saturday and confirmed that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecution asked if Tallis was telling the truth about what Sanford was in the van that night, he said he was "living as my van was in Nashville."
Another controversy was Talisa's assertion that he was familiar with Chambers about two weeks after she died.
The mobile phone records showed that they knew each other just a week ago.
According to Roulette, some time after her death, Chambers Tallis removed her messages, calls, and contacts from her phone.
"He cut her off from his life," Haley said.
The defense side is expected to begin the controversy sides on Sunday.
According to the judge, the case is expected to be handed over to the jury later that same day.
The High Breed: What Is a Conscious Hip Hop?

Is there another black man?!
New York midwives go to court for "Russian" message after being released
A New York-based girl goes to court for a divorced couple after receiving a randomly sent message from her mother complaining that she is "another black-skinned woman."
The couple denies that they are racist, aligning the steps with the "extortion".
In 2016, Linsey Plaska-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her disappointment when she discovered that the new babysitter, Joseph Morris, was black when she arrived on her first working day.
“NEEEEEE, WHY IS ONE BLACK KURA,” wrote Mrs. Plaska-Flaxman in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending her husband, she sent a message to Mrs. Morris twice.
According to the New York Post, after understanding the mistake, Plasca-Flaxman "feeling inadequate" fired Mrs. Morris, claiming that the former nurse, who was also an African-American, was ill-treated and asked what she was doing.
Mrs. Morris paid for the day's work and sent it home to Uber.
Now Morris is going to court for a couple and wants to get compensation for her release according to the conditions on which she was initially hired, although without a contract: <0x24>350 a day for six months of living.
“I want to show them that it’s not possible to do that,” she told the Post on Friday. “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple denied allegations of racism, claiming that the release of Morris was a reasonable decision, taking into account that they could not trust her after she was abducted.
“My wife sent her what she shouldn’t have said.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” said Post husband Joel Plaska.
"Would you trust your children for who you've been rude to, even by chance?
Your baby's?
Is that so?"
The applause corrects the steps to the "exchange" and reports that his wife gave birth only two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
"And will you be chasing a man in such a situation?
It’s quite harsh,” – added the specialist in investment and banking activities.
While judicial dismissal is still ongoing, public opinion has quickly condemned a married couple on social networks, subjecting a sharp criticism of their behavior and logic.
Pyongyang's publishers are worried that readers won't overdo the bear that speaks, talk in a new sheet.
Bond's daughter Karen Yankee, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, wrote about the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads it for the first time before it's published.
It's so exciting to read this, already aware of the great success of Pyongyang."
She said that her father, who worked as a BBC operator before dancing to write a children's book about a little toy bear, was optimistic despite the fact that his work was not accepted and added that you were 60 years old.
She added that her father was silently proud of his final success, referring to Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family."
“He was a fairly quiet man, and not at all commendable,” she said.
"But since Podingtan was so real to him, it was almost a parental honor for a child who had achieved something: you're proud of them, even though it's not really your merit.
I think he's looking at Python's success in that way.
Although it was his creation, the product of his imagination, he always gave the right to Podingtan himself.”
My daughter died, and I had to talk to her on the phone.
Her daughter was taken to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors fought for her life in vain.
“I’ve been on the phone regularly to tell you that it’s really bad that she can’t stand it,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperusa.
“The rest of the time Nad called me to tell me she was going to die in the next two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did it.
I said, “Tashi, I love you so much, sweetheart.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines that doctors gave her to whiten her heart slowly left her body.
She died a while ago, and that was the end.
I just had to sit there knowing that everything was going on there.
I couldn't stand, cry, or cry, because I was surrounded by family and people.
I had to hold on."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz, who had suffered the loss of her daughter, arrived on the plane with the other passengers – and they did not know what she had to go through.
“No one knew,” she said.
“I’ve had tears on my head and tears on my face all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it's in the air that I have a feeling of sympathy for Ned.
He needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women who are sad are taking out cards to warn of suicides on the bridge.
"Two women who have lost their loved ones, who have committed suicide, are doing everything they can to ensure that other people don't take their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys take out cards with warm words and phone numbers on which people can get help on the bridge in Wales.
David Tyler's son was 13 when he began depression, and at the age of 18 he died of suicide.
“I don’t want other parents to feel the way I feel,” she said.
The 45-year-old Mrs. David, who lives in London, said that her son was a talented chef with an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew his smile.
People said that his smile would light up any room.”
However, before his death, he quit his job because he was “in a very dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11, found his brother's body when he committed suicide.
Mrs. David says, “I’m constantly worried that this could have unpleasant consequences.”
Mrs. David created the cards, "so that people knew that there are people in the world that you can call and talk to, even if it's a friend.
“Don’t be silent, you need to talk.”
Mrs. Hasfreys, who has been friends with Mrs. David for many years, lost Mark, her partner, with whom she had lived for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say that he was sad, or that he was depressed, or something like that,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed that his attitude had changed.
On the holiday day, he was very excited: when the children opened the gifts, he didn’t even look at them.”
She said that his death was a great trauma for them, but we had to live with it: “There was a huge hole in the family.
It's just killing us.
But we have to keep living and fighting."

Britta Kavanaugh's future is uncertain because the FBI is investigating
"I thought we could have what he wants - limited in time and in a haphazard investigation - we could get a little bit of poisoning," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was worried that the committee was "resolving that."
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Sometimes they don't want to be explained.
Interim elections will be held in just five weeks, on 6 November – if Republicans are expected to break through, then they will be weakened in their attempts to elect the Supreme Court for the candidate they need.
George W. Bush called a senator to applaud the support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House during Bush's presidency and through him met his wife Ashley, who was then the personal secretary of the Bush administration.
What's going to happen after the FBI releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which now has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes during a vote in the Senate, which will allow Vice President Mike Pence to resolve the issue of equal votes and approve it in the Supreme Court.
The number of passengers from North Korea has decreased under Kim's leadership.
The number of passengers from North Korea to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean official said in a statement.
Meanwhile, Bo Sun, leading South Korea's Ministry of Reunification data, said there were 1,127 passengers last year, and 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the main reasons for this are the increased cross-border control between North Korea and China and the higher costs set by the dealers for resale.
Pyongyang hasn't done that.
The majority of North Koreans are in the process of obtaining South Korea's nationality.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border after the end of the Korean War in 1953.
The majority runs through China, with which North Korea has the longest border. It is easier to cross than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas, which is very strongly protected.
China treats migrants as illegal migrants, not as refugees, and is often forced to repatriate them.
Relations between the North and the South – which are technically still in a state of war – have improved considerably in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks on denuclearization.
This happened after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, when they agreed on a joint deadline to work with the aim of releasing nuclear weapons in full.
But on Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister, Ian Ho, accused the US of sanctions in the absence of progress since then.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we will not be the first to disarm,” Mr. Ry said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Breta Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says she shouldn't work in the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority in the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi called the candidate in the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and stated that, according to his temper, he is not suitable for work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t get rid of the idea that if a woman behaved like this, she would be called a hysterical,” Pelosi told the Senate Legal Committee on Thursday about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s speech.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of sexual harassment to Dr. Christina Blaise Ford while they were still adolescent.
During his speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes even screaming and unable to speak when his family and senior classes were discussing.
He also explicitly blamed the Democrats in the committee, calling the charges against him "grateful and organised murder of a person", organized by liberals, who were displeased with the fact that 2016 was a scandal by Hillary Clinton.
Pelosi said she believed that Kavanaugh's speech had shown that he could not work in the Supreme Court because he had explicitly shown that he had a plan against the Democrats.
“I think he himself has qualified with his own statements and the way he spoke about Clinton and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi was warned when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh, when he would be elected and if the Democrats would get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’ll say that – if he doesn’t tell the truth in Congress or the FBI, he doesn’t just have to work in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he works now,” Pelosi said.
At the moment, Kavanaugh is a judge of the District Court of Appeal of Columbia County.
Pelosi added that as a member of the Democratic Party, she is dissatisfied with Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the law on accessible medicine or in the Row case against Wade, as Kavanaugh is considered a conservative judge.
At the hearings on the confirmation of the position, Kavanaugh did not answer the question of whether he would annul certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time for the hysterical, non-objective people to work in court and wait for us to say 'how wonderful it is'," Pelosi said.
And a woman should be able to do that.
It's a true indictment speech, months and years of anger just fades away, and she can't remember it without tears.
"We're crying when we're angry," Mrs. Stein told me 45 years ago.
“I don’t think it’s that rare.”
She continued: "A woman who worked for the director somewhere helped me a lot, and who said that when she was in trouble, she was crying, but she was working on the technique of behavior. When she was in trouble and started to cry, she said, "That's the conversation.
But I'm angry."
And it just continued the conversation.
I think it was great.”
Tears are allowed in part as the amount goes out, because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my brightest memories of the first job, on which I once cried out of unconditional rage, was then taken by a woman who lived for a cower – a stunning boss, who always scared me a little – and kissed me.
“Never let them see you in tears,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re upset.
They think you're sad and they'll be glad they brought you."
Patricia Shrodar, then a Congressman-Democrat from the state of Calgary, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hunt hit a marriage treason on a yacht called Monkey Business and came out of the presidential race, Mrs. Shrodar thought she could participate in the presidential campaign herself.
“It wasn’t a very thoughtful decision,” she laughed at me 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates, and I didn’t need them at all.
Some have called this situation “The Snow White and the Seven Gnomes.”
Since the company has been around for a long time, it hasn't had the funds, so she said she won't participate in the election if she doesn't raise <0x24>2 million.
It was a win-win situation.
It turned out that some of her supporters, who donated <0x24>1,000 to the man, gave her only <0x24>250.
“Do they think I’m going with a discount?” she thought.
If she spoke with a statement that she would not participate in the election campaign, she was so strongly seized by emotions – thanks to the people who supported her, the anger on the system, which has been so difficult to get money and money.
"You might think I'm nervous," Mrs. Shrodar recalled the press's reaction to her condition.
"It could have been thought that my corporate sponsor is the manufacturer of Kleenex paper grinders.
I've ever thought about what they're going to write on my superb stone.
“She was crying?”
Why the trade war between China and the U.S. could be good for Beijing
The first halls of the trade war between China and the U.S. have been awkward, and as the war is far from over, in the longer term, misunderstandings between the countries may benefit Beijing, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired his first warning earlier this year, taxing China's main export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week, when new tariffs hit goods for a total of <0x24>200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), actually taxing half of the goods that come to the U.S. from Cat.
Every time, Beijing responded in the same way, raising tariffs from five to ten percent on U.S. commodities at a cost of <0x24>60 billion.
China has promised the United States a symmetrical response, and the second-largest economy is unlikely to see it.
In order to force Washington to resign, it is necessary to deepen the demand, but public communication with the United States is almost unacceptable to Chinese leader Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing is rightly using the situation, the pressure of the US trade war in the long run could support China, reducing the interdependence of the two countries.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will start the process of a sharp economic downturn is much more dangerous than the specimens believed to have been, according to the report, Abigail Grace.
Syria is “prepared” for the return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding a country devastated by the war that lasted more than seven years.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mualem said that the conditions in the country are improving.
"Today, the situation in the country is more stable and secure, thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore areas devastated by terrorists in order to return to a normal life.
Now we have all the conditions for the return of refugees to a country that they have been forced to leave because of terrorism and targeted economic measures that have been aimed at improving their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
A further 6 million people who live in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Mu'alem said that the Syrian regime would be happy to accept help to rebuild the devastated country.
However, he stressed that the country will not accept aid in exchange for certain conditions or help from the countries that sponsored the batsmen.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National in Paris, France.
The U.S. has already lost six times in a row on European soil and hasn't won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe was crowned as the team of Danish captain Thomas Birn scored 14.5 points needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Michaelsen, who has competed most in the tournament, kicked his ball in the water for 3 pairs of 16 pounds, finishing this match by Frances Malinara.
The Italian golfer Malinara played well on all levels, becoming one of the four players who passed this field with a score of 5-0-0 since the start of the tournament in the current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spice was knocked out with the 5th and 4th players with the lowest score in the European team, Tornb'orn Olsen from Denmark.
The world's top player, Dastin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Paulter from England, who may have played in his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran of eight Ryder Cups Spanish Sergio García became the player with the most wins in the tournament with a career score of 25.5 points.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t stand today.
It's been a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas who chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to get back the cup.
"It's all about the team, and I'm happy to be able to help," Garcia said after winning the European team.
He handed over the staff to his compatriot John Ram, who on Sunday overcame the legend of American golfer Tiger Woods in a 2&1 singles match.
"I'm very proud to have won Tiger Woods, the man he's been in for his career since childhood," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods has lost all four matches in France and now has a record 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
Strange statistics of one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles and remains on this indicator only from Jack Nicholas.
The American team competed against each other with the exception of Patrick Ryde, Justin Thomas and Tnny Finn, who played throughout the high-class golf tournament.
American captain Jim Fury said after a disappointing game to defend his team: "I'm proud of these guys, they're bikers.
This morning, we have sometimes shown Europe what we can do.
We were competing.
Let's take the hat off in honor of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with the American Golf Association and our Ryder Cup committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
Take off the hat in front of them.
We've been overturned."
