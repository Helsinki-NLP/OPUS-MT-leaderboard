Would you like some more tea?
Exer pierced the tyre.
You think Tom broke the window?
I'll talk to Tom about it.
Don't stand.
There are many galaxies in the universe.
You always sing.
You're very pale.
She paused for a moment.
Could it be done?
I live in Istanbul.
May I ask you a question?
I want to be more than friends.
Can you explain it to me?
I bought some groceries.
All things come to an end.
You just saved me a lot of time.
I wouldn't hurt them.
It was so cold that his teeth were swollen.
What's your name?
Where's your dog?
This is the beginning of a new era.
He was Layla's dance partner.
A little bird told me.
Can I take you home?
Tom has his reasons.
Tom said he needed my help.
Without a doubt.
Just tell Tom I called.
We'd love to get help.
It was love at first sight.
Stand up.
I'm not ready yet.
Tom is still frustrated.
I'd like to buy a dog.
Tom made it clear that he wouldn't do it.
Infrared and ultraviolet rays are types of light invisible to the human eye.
This is useful information.
Sit quietly for a second.
I shouldn't have taken that off.
Tell me what you wrote.
“Learn from your mistakes” and “Experience is the best teacher,” they say, but in the long run even the best teacher is mad if he or she has too much to teach in too little time.
Share the cards, Tom.
I agree with what you wrote.
There's almost no violence in this town.
They already have one.
You really don't have to do that.
Is your clock correct?
I hope it's going to be a dry time.
Could you take a look and see if there's enough bread for our lunch tomorrow?
At least 50 passengers were killed.
It wasn't my fault.
I know him well.
Are they in love?
No one knows what's going on behind these doors.
I know everything.
How could I resist it?
I bought a lot of stuff.
I'm just not very happy.
Let me see you, Tom.
There is no rule without exception.
It's hard for me to believe anyone.
In our world, education is disappointing.
The first thing my mother said to me was, "Are you crazy?"
I've read about 100 books so far.
Mario bought a microscope.
I've never camped.
I'm just listening to you.
He rarely gets angry.
Why do you want to hurt me so much?
On what basis do we know he is innocent?
Did you wash the dishes?
When he returned from office in Afghanistan, Tom pursued nightmares.
I've made a decision.
My hands are cold.
Thank you so much!
The best lecture you can attend is the one you don’t understand.
It won't have any effect.
Don't blink.
Do you have the right one?
I need your help.
Don't you like swimming?
I'm a responsible person.
We've got wine.
I wrote his number on a piece of paper.
Add more water.
What was your day like?
What Tom's suggesting could save us all time.
Italy is a peninsula.
That's beautiful!
He's pretty busy now.
We're not proud of that.
That's a Cuban cigar.
That's his car.
Sure!
Tom cooks potatoes to make potato salad.
They're all the others.
Sign it here.
Come closer.
I'm not always right.
Tell me what it is.
This isn't your hat, is it?
This is my wife Edith.
That's not a good sign.
I'm trying to figure out how you did that.
Anyway, you're wrong.
It's hard to give up long-term love.
He likes extreme sports.

Good luck!
Let's talk about this during lunch.
Where did you get that idea?
Say hello to your friends.
This company is in a bad mood because of its bad debts.
How did I miss that?
Is breakfast included in the price?
Tom said Mary was driving the car.
Tom hates strangers.
Fuck you!
We have to respect our personal rights.
What's that thing about your right hand?
Can I call you around 2:30?
Does anyone in Disneyland want to come with me?
Why is taking pictures of trains so interesting?
I don't usually write songs like this.
It's really so simple.
That was a funny mistake.
What do you eat at all?
Don't talk.
Call him whatever you want.
Don't run in front of the mine!
I feel safe with you.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to do it, but he failed.
Jumi will be a teacher.
I need you.
Fuck you!
His mother is a Yugoslav.
There must be a better way to do this.
That didn't matter to me.
He loves me tomorrow!
It's too loud for me here.
Tom must've been trying to clean this without soap.
It rained so badly that we decided to visit him the other day.
I'm glad Tom won.
There's no one like you.
I don't want to work under these conditions.
Merry Christmas!
Tell Tom you love him before it's too late.
His discouragement made her angry.
She rejected my proposal.
The trains in Serbia are very slow.
In that case, let's go.
Tom wrote a long letter to Mary, but didn't send it to her.
Gymnastics is his strength.
He's got a good memory.
Tom was fired.
The limbs are cold.
Tom's not very nice.
He was a hero to the hero.
I really need Tom here.
I believe you're being honest.
Come and play with us.
Did you know that Tom was ever wrong?
Mary is Catholic, but her boyfriend is an atheist.
I'll never tell anyone who you really are.
I'm proud of you.
I saw Marcus' house.
Tom arrived this morning.
He's pretty busy now.
Who's this man?
Here's some good news.
Refugees are welcome.
Many economists are confused about this fact.
I'm proud of my family.
Tom seemed very confused.
There was a list of available candidates.
How deep is this lake?
What year is your car?
What's your name?
You have three cats.
Tom never said anything about it.
You're too young.
Don't dress up.
Tom never asked why.
I wouldn't hurt you.
We do not have such an example.
Come here. Come here.
Tom's gonna know.
Her passport was stolen.
I know who killed him.
Did I ask you?
You can't touch it.
I've seen a lot so far.
Turn around!
Be kind to me.
What should I see?
Smells.
It took four pounds of gold to win the gold medal.
I'll have dinner at seven.
Give me a sword.
He's not smart enough to pick up numbers in his head.
Look out for me, and I'll look out for you.
You have to trust me.
I don't think your plan is realistic.
Are you familiar with the person in question?
Would you like to talk to Tom for me?
Yesterday I bought this.
How do you say "cat" in Spanish?
We need to act now.
I'm not afraid of death, I'm afraid of dying.
Everybody says that.
He's speaking clearly.
I haven't seen him in a long time.
We're here to play golf.
I haven't seen her in a long time.
Actually, I've never met Tom.
Don't yell.
This one's unique.
I'm too old for something like that.
We'll just follow you.
Knowing yourself is very difficult.
Save the energy, you'll need it later.
It was a pleasant experience.
Tom's in the garage, working on his motorcycle.
You just got shot.
Revenue decreased by 10 percent.
You'll see her.
It can be difficult to visit an unknown land.
They're ready to talk about the problem.
Hidden Cheese.
Okay, you don't have that.
Oh, finally!
He appreciates contemporary art.
After a long look, at the end of the day, I did things.
It's okay. It's okay.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me.
Does this happen often?
They walked along the beach.
We're cutting.
Can you talk to me?
Reduce the TV.
I wear T-shirts and short sleeves.
Old people often talk to themselves.
Tom hoped to become a famous writer.
Tom became a member of this club three years ago.
Tom showed me the phrase he wrote when he was a teenager.
Where's the Avis cooler?
Don't be a street slut.
Tom could tell us how to do it.
I just got going.
Tell him I'm innocent.
She spends <0x24>3 a day for lunch and dinner.
See you in your dreams.
Come in here.
I'm going home tomorrow.
I think you're stupid for that.
I've seen a lot so far.
I feel bad because I lied.
They told me to wait here.
I'm not young enough to know everything.
The lawyer's job is to prove her client's innocence.
How would you know that?
Tell me what you know.
Tom will remember.
Why don't you just tell Tom?
If there is no porn with it, porn will be made with it.
Canada is the motherland of ice hockey.
What did I forget to say?
How often do you clean your room?
He's trying to save money so he can go abroad.
I'm not going to change.
I want to go to Bali.
You can if you try.
I'm the one who gave it to Tom.
I'm glad Tom won.
All right, what about you?
This is undoubtedly an extremely unpleasant situation for me.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.
She's jogging every morning before breakfast.
This time it leads to the city.
I'm not happy with that.
I waited for the language.
These are my best friends.
I have to live.
We have two sons.
Tom was the only boy invited to Mary's party.
Don't talk.
We had a rough fight.
What has science ever done for us?
Stop watching TV and start learning.
Turn left.
We don't know our neighbors.
You'll find a book in the library.
The police found the stolen money.
I've never done this before.
I came here a few minutes before you.
Fantastic!
I didn't do that either.
How much is a bottle of beer?
Where's Tony?
I'd like to talk to Tony.
I'll be back later.
You smell nice.
It was obvious that Tom did not want to kiss Mary.
Tom is so rich that even his servants have servants.
That's the table.
Flowers, flowers.
What a shame!
His brother is a very capable doctor.
I'm tired of arguing.
I have enough space.
What are you gonna do today?
I'm just thinking loudly.
Don't yell.
I can't stop thinking about stolen money.
That train passed through you.
Come and see us.
A young man is often thoughtless.
I don't think he knows I love you.
I'm not mad at anyone.
They need each other.
Let's go get something to eat.
Is that what you think?
Can we agree to disagree with each other?
I'm trying to be careful.
There are always problems when it comes to my child.
Not yet.
One day she wants to study abroad.
Check this out.
Come fast!
Where's my suitcase?
He wants to get rid of painful memories.
You're absolutely right.
I don't know.
I'm convinced.
Add more water!
Music is important to me.
I worked on it day after day.
Do you have a favorite?
Please, come on.
Just slow down!
No one has a soul.
I pretended I didn't know what was going on.
Where there is grass, there is no water, where there is water, there is no grass.
My friend got 95 points on the math exam.
He didn't let anyone else in the room.
Better with kindness than with force.
I have a lot to do today.
You're in trouble.
I'm not going to school tomorrow.
In the Russian language, there is no word "freedom".
I thought you were gonna be busy.
It's great.
Could that be true?
Shut up, Tom.
That bag's mine.
Tom left before I got here.
Tell us a story about ghosts!
I hope Tom's safe.
We've been talking about it all night.
I want to live in town.
What are you going to do this summer?
I tried to stop doing more things at the same time.
Let's get out of here.
That must have been hard.
Your desire is a command for me.
I'll call her tonight.
I had to make some tough decisions.
Tom is Mary's grandfather.
Ammonia is the base.
Try it again.
Are you being honest?
That made sense to me.
She is educated in the United States.
Tell me what I have to do.
Open your mouth!
He didn't tell me anything.
The fire spread to the neighboring building before the firefighters arrived.
Tom didn't make friendships as easy as Mary.
I thought this was going to happen a few months ago.
The bad weather prevented me from leaving.
Tom bought the paper.
And that one's for me.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Black smoke came out of the stove.
I know the gentleman.
You'll never catch me alive!
It is one of the biggest summer music festivals.
I was open and honest.
It's time to go to bed.
Give me a dollar for the book.
Shut your mouth and sit down.
What's this?
He's gone.
Tom fell asleep again.
Don't move!
He's an American.
He's just talking to Mary.
No doubt about it.
The first lesson is easy.
You've grown up so fast.
Tom's gonna make it.
I got off the train.
We are brothers and sisters.
I know how to do more things at the same time.
No one is as fast as you.
I agreed to buy it.
She's in a bad mood.
Am I the only one going to the party?
I really hope you're kidding.
Please, be honest with me.
Are you sarcastic?
Leave your imagination at will.
Okay, what about you?
Tell me where you live.
Can you prove that?
You can't go into that room.
What did you do to me?
It's all here.
Why exactly me?
Tom and Mary were wrong about it.
I'm not as tall as you.
How many years have it been since I last saw you?
If you do that, you will regret it for the rest of your life.
You're a soul melting pot.
Tom was silent for a moment.
I knew I never should have interfered in your stupid business.
The light just disappeared from itself.
Tom asked Mary to give him one more chance.
Ask the policeman!
We have five fingers on each hand.
We worked together.
Do you think I missed something?
Tom's saving to buy a yacht.
Everybody knows Tom's why his wife left him.
You're driving me crazy.
What do I write in the newspaper?
The system was repaired after three years of volunteer work.
I need your signature.
She called me very late last night.
I had nothing in common with them.
I'm claustrophobic.
Naoko lives in the White House.
The new branch to Haugesund will become the main effective travel link to Oslo and East Norway for the entire western region.
You disappointed me.
Hello, how are you?
She got four emails.
I'm really happy about that.
Tom suspects that Mary and I are heading for something.
Where did you find this knife?
You look good for your age.
Tom managed to find Mary's house without difficulty.
It's not an easy sport.
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency.
I just don't want to do that.
You shouldn't have bought that.
They have the right to vote.
I find it hard to express in words what I mean.
Tell me where you are.
Will we see Tom again?
Scroll right to the next corner.
My mother cooks for me.
I'm trying to be careful.
A woman eats bread.
I listened to music.
Are you involved in this?
Do you know why I'm here?
I hope he doesn't notice my mistake.
I must have eaten something bad.
We'll be leaving soon.
Is Tom still there?
Tom doesn't know how to swim as he used to know.
Everyone knows I don't like Tom.
Both responses are possible.
Tom works too much.
Avoid addicts to the color dilutor.
I liked that one.
He did not hide his disappointment.
The boy has a horse.
Do you like roller coasters?
We're missing food.
Tom says the same thing.
We just want to go home.
It's a good time today.
Can you make Tom smile?
You have no idea how right you are.
Tom and I were busy.
Proletariats of all countries, unite!
I'm very impressed.
I assumed you were busy.
Tom couldn't attend the meeting because he was sick.
Tell me why you did that.
Italy is located in Europe.
How many people were there?
I'm sure Tom will miss me so much.
So where did Tom go?
It's easy to hang out with Tom.
Mary came back from school in tears because her friends had mocked her.
You have the right to be happy.
I don't think anyone knows.
You have to work more.
Why are you so paranoid?
Tom turned around the room, unable to calm down.
Would you mind if I got a hug?
I caught an empty cage.
Take a rest, Tom.
What does he want to do?
We're here to play golf.
Why don't you come back sometime?
She's wondering how that's possible.
Santa Claus lives on the north pole.
He was born in Ohio.
Please, go.
Look at that.
Wake up!
You chose a nice one.
Look how much it is!
I tried to be nice.
Mary's a wedding planner.
Houston, we had a problem.
Why do you always have to get involved?
I'm having trouble talking about my feelings.
I'll give you whatever you want.
That's their book.
Mary returned from school crying because her friends had mocked her.
I'm not sure when Tom will arrive.
You should come home.
Alice laughed.
She can't give up.
Do you want to turn off the lights?
I'll save you.
I'll let you know.
We can watch Tom in a suit, behind a large black piano with dramatic finger movements, creating music that is very pleasant to listen to.
Strong winds broke a lot of branches from the trees last night.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
We need to prepare a negotiating ground.
Shouldn't you be getting ready for work?
There are 40 students in this class.
They laughed at him because of his mistakes.
The path to a man's heart leads through the stomach.
Every ship needs a captain.
It's time to get up.
The house is built of brick.
I didn't write this.
I landed at the wrong bus stop.
I can't feel partially responsible.
People were good to me.
I know this is weird.
Tom's out of sight now.
We should celebrate together.
Tom and Mary are leaving today.
Have you ever tried it?
Dr. Jackson has a good relationship with the patient.
My father lives and works in Tokyo.
Are you a student?
Can I get a cigarette?
I could go with you.
Take a little.
Come in.
The Burj Khalifa is currently the world's tallest skyscraper.
How many blankets are in bed?
You really don't have to do that.
Why are you so smart?
I'm cooking lunch.
I wonder what Tom is going to do.
I'm fat.
To reach the mountain, you need to be able to read notes.
Tom was squeezing.
They wanted an apology.
Where'd I go wrong?
Our school was founded in 1990.
Does that make you angry?
I drink vitamins every day.
I'll call you later.
Why me?
Obviously, I was too optimistic.
Tom cooks for us.
We live in a house.
You're not done yet?
You're very untrained.
He makes good money.
Tom says he's healthy.
I'm the only one here who can do that.
The zoo is closed on Monday.
That's the point.
Knowledge of foreign languages is useful for everyone.
They don't like to do that.
She let me go.
It is very natural for a human being to always give himself preference over the interests of others.
I eat here.
It's all right.
You think Tom broke the window?
I have a lot of things planned for tomorrow.
I thought it was pathetic.
He was named captain of the football team.
Why are you still awake? You should go to bed.
I was in school yesterday.
Tom did what he was told.
I'm still working.
Insidious, insensitive children can sometimes grow into sociopaths.
I'd like him to be with you.
The job of the police is to prevent and investigate crime.
Can you give me a remote?
This isn't exactly what I wanted.
After you.
We're all working too hard.
I'm Ricardo.
Thank you for everything you've done for us.
I'm not perfect.
He learns very quickly.
You're different.
She doesn't know the hatred of others.
This will make our job a lot easier.
He loves football.
What time can you come?
The monks were able to play tennis in the monasteries.
No one trusts him anymore.
Keep the kids away from drugs.
Is he your new boyfriend?
I was wondering if I might be dreaming.
Everything changes over time.
No one's going anywhere.
The game can be postponed until next week.
I have a soul.
Driving to work from an hour and a half of the emerald.
That's right.
Your time will come soon.
Tom had no idea I was going to be there.
This doesn't matter.
Tom's in the warehouse.
I was in Rome.
I'm natural.
I turned around.
I completely forgot to do it.
Marriage is the main cause of all divorces.
He's here.
I'll figure something out.
It all started a year ago when he came home.
Play it again, Sam.
You're drinking coffee?
Some of us think that such views are purely insane.
It works.
Somebody could be hurt.
Tom didn't write any letters to Mary while she was there.
We're tired of you.
You won't be able to handle this job.
We all know that Tom is to blame.
She's Chinese.
I don't drink vodka.
We're gonna have to deal with it.
I'll be back.
Look at these.
He needs it.
Don't forget to extend your passport.
I think Tom pulled a thicker end.
I bet Tom never spoke to you like that.
I've changed.
I'm more concerned with you than with the future of Japan.
I couldn't have had no pity on him.
When I woke up this morning, I felt a slight nausea.
Is that the woman who knows the answer?
Let's hope Tom's okay.
I've read about 100 books so far.
I promoted to the skin.
Come and play with us.
And it was only with great pain.
I'll go if you go.
Let's watch TV.
Few people know it exists.
Did you write the number?
That's not a reason to panic.
I only got 20 points on my math exam.
The worst headaches are caused by insufficiently understood ideas.
I'm really happy to be here.
What are you looking at?
I still don't understand anything.
My mother died the day I got married.
Investigate this.
What's your name?
They're trying.
My future is in your hands.
He's a fake, isn't he?
Tom has three sons and one daughter.
Tom's cold-blooded.
That's what I'm used to doing.
I met him a day earlier.
Don't stop.
Please help us find this card.
Can you tell the difference between the silver and the coin?
Hands up!
I'm not practicing as much as I should.
I'm not mad at anyone.
I think that's really important.
She doesn't speak English, she speaks French.
That's so sad.
How smart!
You should know better.
In short, I do not agree.
I'm a responsible person.
You're not dating anyone, are you?
She's a teacher.
Without water, it is impossible to live.
I've been playing piano a long time, so I still know a little.
Is this your glass, or your sister?
The battle lasted a week.
Tom knew what he wanted.
The mother and daughter represented two generations.
We're finally here!
She's in good hands.
He said he had to work in the garden for two hours a day.
Apples and pears are gifted, not gold and green forests.
I'm resting my legs.
The professor's statement is almost perfect.
Do you want to learn something specific?
I really like to practice.
I love you!
I'm really proud of that.
We were in the last place.
I contributed.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
I can read German, but I can't say it.
That doesn't look like you.
She has achieved her goal.
I'm twice as old as Tom.
Madness has crossed the border.
Isn't that black?
This is not a children's book.
You're absolutely right.
Come on, sit next to me.
We know we're better than that.
It's like I don't know!
Let's not talk about this now.
Have fun.
It's time to break up.
What kind of food do you like to cook?
I was thinking about you.
I love dogs.
Who are they talking to?
They know you.
He was the son of a wealthy merchant.
The talk about the meeting is ready.
I said I'd wait for you.
She looks good for her age.
What's this?
What are you eating at all?
I don't like being judged.
I have an appointment tonight.
Tom enjoys fishing.
A man is hoped for as long as he lives.
Be cautious.
Let's talk about options.
Don't worry, if you help me, everything's gonna be fine.
I'm dying of a miracle.
It was a funny movie.
We just saw her.
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency.
I think it's a waste of time.
We're trying.
Why is this our problem?
Tom's gonna take care of this.
Go check it out.
Some of us hate it.
"This came for you." "Uh..." "Well, you remember the one she sent to you when you asked her to take pictures of Applejack's brother?" "Yeah." And then she told you to write a critique of Mack's physical appearance; "Yeah," "You sent a review of Mack's." "Yeah, you sent it out of Mack."
I've always loved horror movies.
Napoleon's horse was white.
People were kind to me.
How did I overlook that?
I don't want to take you any more time.
I go to church only out of respect for my mother.
It is better to live a day like a lion than a hundred years like a sheep.
"Did he explain?" "Yes."
Not every lamp is magical.
Tom won't be able to answer these questions.
I'll do it with pleasure.
He killed himself.
I was very excited.
You don't have to eat right before you go to bed.
Tom's gonna wait.
What's going to happen now?
I need five more minutes.
The students didn't know how to respond.
She's embarrassed to lie.
I'm not a nightbird.
Did you get the package I sent you?
I'm not a doctor.
My baby wants to talk.
I'm glad to see you again.
Tom bought me a VIP ticket.
I'm fat.
I'm the one who should do it.
Tom's gonna call.
He lit the fire before he went into the cave.
I'm not hiding from anyone.
This is a very good place.
I don't live with Tom.
I heard that Tom dropped out of college.
Why do you hate me so much?
What am I doing here?
Tom will understand.
These girls are very busy.
Give us some space.
There's truth in what Tom is saying.
You didn't say anything wrong.
I'm sick of your pussy.
Get out of here!
We have two TVs.
We like to play football.
Make a place.
The horse must have gathered and the knight fell from the horse.
I didn't forget.
There are islands at sea.
I'm investigating that right now.
The mini skirts are modern again.
What are we really looking for?
She has achieved her goal.
Tom can do what he wants, as far as I'm concerned.
Tom said he needed the money.
Tom was pretty good.
Hurry up!
He couldn't understand much of what they said to each other.
This medicine will relieve your headache.
He disappeared without a trace.
Oh, leave me alone.
They both like it.
We sat together in silence for a while.
You look great.
I'm home.
He never takes the train.
He's addicted to Starbuck's coffee.
The book is on the table.
The two sides will hold talks this week.
I'm going to give you a computer by the end of the month.
The cardboard is stronger than the paper.
Why did you shave your beard?

Could he be alive?
Did you just meet him?
Honestly, I don't know.
These are your choices.
That makes sense.
It's safer.
Tell me about your teacher.
I saw the house.
Maybe she has other plans?
This is not a sentence.
Thank you all for coming! See you next time.
The patient is exhaled.
Thank you all for that.
I don't see anything suspicious.
This evidence leaves no room for doubt, this can in no way be Picasso's original work.

If you want to talk to a lot of people, you need to learn Esperanto. Why this language? Because it is at the same time beautiful and stimulates our learning.

If you can learn Esperante

We can't stop Tom from doing that.
I'm not selective.
Eat everything.
That's what I used to do.
Get out of here!
Tom's still at work.
Tom wasn't very good.
You better think when you're staring.
Anything else?
Anyway, you're wrong.
You need more than coffee.
That's the norm.
Are we all here?
He knows a lot of people.
I'm freaking out.
I feel bad because I lied.
Tom was stunned by the pain.
All or nothing.

He asked a lot of questions about Islam.
If we go right now, we'll be in Boston by 2:30.
What did you two do?
Where will Tom sleep?
Emily was surprised.
I'm not ready yet.
Why would Tom want that?
It's hard to figure out what really happened.
She passed through her hair with her fingers.
Tom works hard to support his family.

That's better.
Look over there.
In the morning, we found a dolphin.
I'm reading this book.
Just tell me you're okay.
Please, take this little gift.

I'm not from here.

Excuse me, who is this woman?
Do you have a copy?
Come here to help me.
I barely got out of the house when it started to rain.
Tom likes to be busy.
Well, as always.
The first one.

I'm a little upset.
Does that mean you love me?

The garage was stunned.
Check this out.

He tried to kill himself.
Tom told me to ask you.
Everybody knows that.
She was enjoying the party yesterday.
Just tell me the truth.
The birds sing.
Be careful: we write nationalities, given in a week and languages with a big letter in English.
I like to watch you work.
The birds are flying.
I'm not ready yet.
I'm not upset at all.
As far as we know, Tom is guilty.
I love you.
Tom's a bookmaker.
I've changed my mind.
The problem is that it's too expensive.
Many would like to be motivated, creative, thoughtful beings, only if they got that chance.
I've been thinking a lot about what you said.
Did Tom draw a thicker end?
I'm not afraid of death, I'm afraid of dying.
We like him.
That's a good answer.
You sound tired.
Tom was wrong about that.
I don't need anything.
Tom always makes a mess of things.
He was running.
That's not the right thing.

I think Tom is very smart.
Do you really want to learn another language?
Fish, please.
I think I'm fat.
I think we were lucky.
Don't talk.
Are you studying French at your school?
Come and have a drink with me.
If I could understand, I'd say so.
You're running.
I took the first step.
Stop yelling.
It's Saturday.
They were evacuated to a Polish hospital in the United States.
We'll run in the park.
How far is it from here?
You can't sit next to me.
I'm not happy about that.
Could you have read it?
Will you dance with me?
We have to call Tom.
Tom's not strong enough.
We need more flour.
Tell me what he's saying here.

He is eternally dissatisfied.

I called him.
It was all just an accident.
Tom never saw us.
Mom, I'm hungry.
I'm not going to do that.
Tom says he wasn't here.
It usually works.
How did you find Tom's hideout?
Go upstairs.
Can you give me a sign?
I locked my bike.
And now a word from our sponsor.
I was hardly satisfied with the condition.
Do you have a copy?
We can't call him a witness.
That's not the main question.
We're glad we're here.
Just stay calm.
I'm armed.
Tom can't stand it.
Our eyes can't see infrared rays.
It's time to go to bed.
Tom is very intelligent.
Can I replace this one?
Tom wanted to have a better cat than his neighbor.
I'm impressed by you.
Did you bring a fence?
I already ordered it.
We'll never know why.
How do you feel?
Everybody tells me I'm weird.
Bitcoin and Ethereum with virtual currencies.
It's all very cheap.
Anything you remember can help.
A lot of predictions don't come true.
I admit I'm tired.
I'm still wrong.
Turns out it's true.

Tom is an activist in his community.
I'm stupid and not alone while I eat.
You look fat.
Learning a language is not easy.
Do you have a headache?
You have to learn English step by step.
It's better now than it used to be.
Tom and Mary are different from heaven and earth.
Tom asked me what I thought about who would win the race.
A man has a lot of desires that he does not really want to fulfill and it would even be wrong to assume the opposite. He wants them to remain only desires, they have value only in his imagination; their fulfillment would be a bitter disappointment for him. One of those desires would be a bitterness with a bitterness and a bitterness of life, and a wish for eternal life.

Why are you asking?
I saw Mark's house.
At least you're honest.
It's really pretty bad.
Thank you all for that.

Do not exaggerate.
I can't approve this project, it's got a lot of flaws.

No, that's all.
Come to my house.

The bathroom's upstairs.
It's Christmas tomorrow.
Why are you doing this to yourself?

I'm already used to it.
It's not that bad.
Looks like she was offended by what he said to her.

You were really good to me.
I'll finish reading this book.
Who are you really?
We all cried a lot.
Did you wash the dishes?
I'll tell you the truth now.
Do I usually look happy?
It's not an essay alone problem, but all these disastrous questions and explanations of words make me terribly insane!
It's the weekend.
I'll be back next week.
Looks uncomfortable.
What have you both done?
I really want to see her.
It was a lucky shot.
I thought Tom was unbelievable.
I've never seen anything like that before.
I'm buying a lot of stuff in that store.
Have you received the package I sent you?
I wish you were with me.
Try this.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
He started screaming.
I'll be there when I finish my homework.
Clean up a little.
Can I use your dictionary?
Did you manage to do it yourself?
Don't push.
Can we try this?
Most people like chicken.
Is Tom insane?
I didn't do that either.
Are you ready?
Let's take a look again.

I don't believe it.
My mother died the day I got married.
Don't let anyone in!
What would Tom think?
We're not getting into it.
It happens to everyone sooner or later.
That's my question.
Hold on, Tom.
Tom definitely pulled a thicker end.
Follow me.
I don't care what your name is.
He's not straight.
It's all right with me.
Obviously Tom's sick.
I started learning English when I was twelve years old. Then I was interested in languages, but not to that extent. Now I speak English, French, Spanish and Portuguese; so it is time to learn Latin.
We live in a very safe country.
I can't remember that song.
I'm Ricardo.
I need an honest girl.
She's a beginner.
Are they still here?
I'm sure Tom will miss me so much.
Tom won't run away.
I'd go.
I'm not accepting a myth.
Down! Down!
Tom couldn't stand it.
Anything you remember can help.
You'll be better in a few days.
What language are you speaking?
That's not something to worry about.
I understand that they're in the eye of people like you, but this is just awkward.
Tom's gonna make it.
There's no free lunch.
And what if I'm gay? Is that a crime?
Anyway, he'll definitely come.
Please leave this place as clean as you would like to find it.
We're going through the jungle somehow.
Did Tom really move to Boston?
That's all we can do.
Friends, can I talk to you for a minute?
That's your life.
What's your name?
I get it.
We got lucky, didn't we?
I'm crying.
I'm sorry.
Stop self-pity.
He'll be finished soon.
You learn by doing it.
You'll never walk alone.
Tom's the one you want.
The police are chasing me.
Have you seen anyone there?
Anyway, you're wrong.
They won't take it.
There is no rule without exception.
Maybe you need a blade.
In the garden there are all kinds of flowers.
No one said anything.

We managed to get away on time.
I'm tired of everything.
Tom doesn't fit here.
Carthage must be destroyed!
How much does it cost?
I want to talk to Tom about it.
We've got some options.
It's supposed to work.
She hated him.
As far as I'm concerned, I'm not opposed to your opinion.
Isn't that what you wanted?
I could talk to Tom about it.
It's just like that.
Take a little.
Who knows what will happen tomorrow?
I've had a cold since this run.
I'm a translator.
It was hot in every sense of the word.
Spit me up.
Talk about others as you would like them to talk about you!
Tom was so confused that he didn't even know what question to ask.
Are you ready?
Find Tom.
I think it's okay.
What do you think?
You've changed my life.
Somehow we're going through the jungle.
Reaction is not always the best way to work.
I'm not going to tell anyone you did that.

This is my computer.
It was kind of surreal.
In theory it is possible, but in practice it is very difficult.
I don't have time to write.
It's time to get up.
Almost worth it.
Please, send me your picture.
That's my money, too.
Anyway, it's over.
Tom's dismantled.
Remember the name of the file before you try to restore the deleted files.
I'm trying to be careful.
Tom ran down the street.
The answer to this question is simple.
Let's get to work.
Only vodka from Russia is a real Russian vodka!

It's happening.
How long do you think Tom's been preparing for the exam?
A book that describes the wonders of nature.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
You don't have to shoot stones in a greenhouse.
I'll scream.
Mary was silent for a moment.
Do you have a dog?
He exhaled.
I tried to convince Tom to come home.
I'd get involved.
You can't touch it.
Don't vaccinate.
I shouldn't have told Tom to do that.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Check everybody out.
Mary is a retired nurse.

Swimming is a form of exercise.
I don't speak Japanese.

The girl eats bread.
I don't speak English.
You're not the one who died.
Would you prefer tea?
I'll explain.
I'm too busy at work.
I'm a woman.
Tom asked for help.
It's not exactly like that.
They know you.
I put out every test.
What are you going to do today?
What's in your mind?
I'll kill you!
I was as cold as a syringe.
There is no point in just waiting for something to happen; you have to do something right away.
Here's the key from my apartment.
It's an area with a lot of new homes.

We walked through the park.
I was in a great mood.

And if I were rich, I wouldn't give him money.
Are we safe now?
Stop it! Stop it!
We've been learning all afternoon.
Will you send this as a postcard?
What are you suggesting?
It is said that love is blind.
I don't have any home today.
I was just too busy.
Did you talk about me?
The sky was darker and darker.
Watch out!
We did everything we could.
Am I ever wrong?

Justice has to be completely satisfied.
Tom and Mary would be a wonderful couple.
How do you say XXX in Dutch?

Did you pass the exams?
We're on the bus, we're going to have to walk now.
I'll let you go.
I strongly support your comments.
I'll try to convince Tom to help us.
How about creating a group on Facebook so that we can discuss learning a foreign language?
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
Did we agree?
It's not that scary.
Let's talk in the hallway.
Can you ask Tom to call me?
We don't know for sure.
Stop smoking. Stop smoking.
Tom went there.
You owe me an apology.
Am I safe now?
Give me the number.
I can't either.
I'm sure Tom wouldn't want to do that.
Tom was afraid of me before.
Tom whispered something to Mary and she smiled.
But why?
May I see your card?
What's going to happen now?
Be careful, the knife is very sharp.

We're not both as rich as we'd like.
Tom wouldn't be happy.
Tom has a beautiful garden.

I hate that.

Tell me what's going to happen.
He lied to us.
We're trying.
Tom's gonna look.

I'd accept it.
Humans are complicated organisms.
They'll know what to do.
Why did you keep silent all the time?
He's gone.
He himself saw Layla's reaction.

You should probably talk a little slower.
Happy Mother's Day!
I need a beer.
You're not funny.
They all appreciate Henry.
I thought you were married.
It was a great success.
Sit down, please.

Crazy!
You pay me well.
I'm glad people saw it.
You need to talk to me.

It doesn't matter where I am.
Where were you in Japan?
They're all gone.
I'll learn more diligently.

Are you having trouble understanding what your wives or young children are saying?
Looks like Cathy likes music.
He refused to comment.
Imagine yourself in my place.
Can you prove that?
We're trying.
I'm giving up.
You disappointed me.
Tom looked angry.
Don't overdo it.
Oh, yes, I'm gonna have work tomorrow.
No one cares about me.
So what's the plan now?
Excuse me.
I wasn't home all day yesterday.
I'd be grateful if you stayed until tomorrow.
I'm sure they need you.

I'm not doing it again.
I thought you wouldn't be able to do that.
We'll just follow you.
Tom asked me not to tell anyone, so I didn't.
Are we coming soon?
I am not a prophet.
I'm sure you two will agree.
I hope I'm not the only one who will be there.
Are you angry about that?
I'm divorced.
I don't expect Tom to be here today.
This makes me very uncomfortable.
We're from Russia.
Costs will rise soon.
I work at the language school.
Did I really feel so happy?

I'll probably never use this again.
This kid kept crying for hours.
I'd buy that one.
This transcends all borders.
I have a headache today.
Tell me where you live.
Are we safe now?
I want to go.
Obviously, I was a little shocked.
Don't talk.
French is his native language.
His words made him angry.
I was laughing.
It wasn't too hot.
I'm completely out of money.
I almost forgot my passport.
I was looking for you.
Tom reads a lot.

Looks like you haven't been all yours lately.
She's good enough.
I've definitely had luck.
I hope that's true.
I wonder whose word this is.
Tom bought the time.
Everyone kept breathing.
Read this.
I'm sorry, I didn't remember the name.
I'm sure I'll get that tennis match.
That's not funny at all.
I called him.

What did you like the most along the way?
I like to watch you work.
Tom suggested that Mary go to the doctor.
I hope we go to Beijing as well.

I'm a vegetarian.
The picture is in this book.
To strive to maximize one's own interest, happiness or security seems very natural to a human being.

I have a few gifts.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Translation is not as easy as many people think.
Tom would never admit that.
It was just the beginning.
Have you finished your homework?
Over the last few days I have been doing research on making money using the project, but I think all options will require a sudden change in my lifestyle, which is an inconvenient thing.
Is everything okay between us?
I've never camped.
I thought the food was great.
I have to plan everything.
Let's change the subject.
We counted the beetles on the tree that we cut down and found that it was thirty years old.
See you later, Tom.
Would you like a fruit jus?
Let's arrange a meeting.
I annoyed him.
Why can't you get it?
You can't sit next to me.
Did you expect something else to happen?
Tom's still in shock.
I'm a very sad man.
Boston is a great city.
Hopefully people will like it.
Maybe they're leaving tomorrow.
Come here, I want to show you something.

Tom helped us save a lot of money.
That's interesting.
I'm scared.
Yesterday I was happy.
You are my sun.

No one helped us.
I don't want to go to school.
How long have you been living here?

I want to live in Brazil.
Get some help.
I didn't ask you not to do that.
Tom writes a letter to his shirt every week.
Trier is the oldest city in Germany.
Mary is Tom's daughter.
He still has no experience for this job.
Can you help us out?
Would you like to cool down?
Tom encouraged Mary to write about her experiences.
I could have gone, but I didn't want to.
I've changed my mind.
Based on the data I've given you, what story would you be dating with?
Who can not be proud of being a Serb, with their greatest achievements in history - the massacre of chiefs and genocide?
That makes it more uniform.
You know you're deactivating the bomb?
Will you invite her to the party?
Where did I leave my keys?
I'm a big fan of football.
She came alone.
I can't believe you didn't recognize your brother.
Tom has lost his senses.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
He's not missing anything.
Tom's gonna look.
I'm wondering if anyone could help me, I've got a cell phone that just shows a bug message.
I'm surprised.
They were all smiling.
I miss you.
You should spend more time outside and less inside.
Tom played on the strongest card.
He left his family and moved to Tahiti.
I've played golf with Tom a lot of times.
You underestimate me.
What is your favorite youtube video?
Millie's listening to music.
The sea is green.
I don't have a guitar.

We're close friends.
He canceled the last minute meeting.
We're just getting started.
My friend can speak Hindi fluently.
Yeah, isn't it great?
Please, get off the ground.
I like Tom, but I don't like him.
Where can I find a tourist office?
I'm comfortable.

I just finished it.
I'm going to knock on the door, and I'm going to knock on the door.
Don't stop.
Please come and see me tomorrow.
I have the impression that he knows the secret.
It was a little weird.
Tom's not going to pass the exam.
Will you do this to me?
I really enjoyed it.
Nobody's dead... yet.
In my beginning it's my end.

We have three dogs, one white and two black.
Tom, this is my brother, John.
Tom was writing on the ground with a stick.
Wouldn't you like another glass of milk?
Relax!
Who's she?
I bought this yesterday.
Chances are against me.
I'll fire you.
Kids are playing outside.
It's all right with you.
Do what you want, I don't care at all.
She expects us to help her.
Who are you?
Call me anytime, I always have shoulders to cry.
Did I get fired?
I'm afraid you misunderstood me.
That's good.
I don't want to bother you.
Tell me what's going to happen.
Tom's seen a lot.
Thank you for coming!
What's your blood group?
Are we leaving soon?
I found his book.
They're selling sugar in the store.
Tom and Mary watched the sunset together.
You did a great job.
Tom does that sometimes.

I think Tom's careful.
Oh, no!
I forgot about the baby's monitor.
Tom's upstairs.
He's kind.
Just relax.

This is the beginning of a new era.
Mary is so cute no matter what she wears.
Shit's happening.
Watch out!
Tom has not been able to provide any evidence to support his statement.
Why would Tom come now?
Are you sure this is safe?

You have a bad nature.
Is this your phone?
I'm just going.

Let's find out for sure.
I'm awkward.
Yesterday I was happy.
By the way Mary knocked on the door, Tom realized she was sad.
Husbands and wives should help each other as long as they live.
All we need is water.

You stole my idea.
Here we can be happy to be.
He's very educated.
Tom made it himself.
Do you agree with what Tom wrote in his report?
He's tightened up again.
Is that what you need?
Take it all.
You've tried.
Our yacht club has 10 members.
I wouldn't hurt him.
Would you be able to do that?
Mom, this aunt and man are holding hands, they're very good friends, aren't they?
Can I send you home?

- Be careful.
Maybe there's something wrong with you.
I'll drive.
Don't open it.
I had a problem when I solved this problem.
I don't want Tom to see me naked.
I have one brother.
You're the most accessible person I know.
Get in touch with Tom.
We've been here all day.
You know I can't give you that kind of information.
I didn't do that.
I have a few friends.
I have to look for her.
I can't wait.
I'll check.
Tom was shocked.
Just a moment, please.
We'll get you one.
Tom wants to know when you're done.
Call me.
Tom's still looking shocked.
That's what the doctor ordered.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Tom knows what's coming.
I'm impressed.
"If P, then Q" is logically equivalent to "(No P) and/or Q".
He speaks English.
I'm writing a message to Tom right now.
That's an exception.
Tom arrived a little earlier today than usual.
Do you believe in eternal life?

Actually, I never met Tom.
Which is easier?
Tom asked for an increase.
Fadil wasn't in the house.
I've never noticed that before.
This is supposed to work.
Where have you been all afternoon?
What do you have to do?
I always liked Tom more.
Where's Tom hiding?
What can't you tell me?
Tom bought the papers and read them in the train on his way to work.
I have house ghosts.
Look at that.
We'll keep this piece of cake for Tom.
You're funny.
Are Tom and Mary Really Married?
Horses sleep standing.
Let me try the other one.
You work slow.
I didn't do that either.
Snorri Sturluson's stories speak, among other things, of the spread of Christianity in Norway through violence.
Answer me right away.
Feel at home!
Students didn't know how to respond.
Did you know that before?
I'll try to convince Tom to do it.
Am I so different?
I've got my ass kicked out.
I assumed you were busy.
Who are you running from?
This stylish golden necklace with hearts is a necklace that will "smoke your world."
Your answer is correct.
I love Leanne.
It all happened at lightning speed.
Do we have to tell Tom?
It rained a lot.

Be careful with your wishes, maybe it will come true for you.
Tom is a 3rd year student.
Who's coming with us?
Sounds like you've learned an important lesson.

How many books do you have?
I'll do it myself.
You're sad.
All three of the boys laughed.
We're all tired of this.
I gotta drink something.

Don't thank me.
I assumed you were busy.

You have to control yourself.
What's the difference?
I recognized him at first glance.
The French are our friends.
That's very nice of you.

I saw a squirrel.
She doesn't speak English.
I saw the squirrel.
It's snowing in Paris.
I hope Tom will be back safely.
I have no idea what was going on in his head, so he refuses such a favorable proposal.
I just got up.
How's it feel?
Can you make Tom laugh?
I'd better clean it now.
You tried.
My dog is blind, but he likes to go out and walk.

Do you know how to cook?
Tom loves sports.
I've learned French.
I like to walk.
I think I'm a pretty good writer.
I asked Tom to wake me up at 2:30.
Tom thinks the same way.
That's his weakness.
You're one of us.
Faith can move mountains.
One foot is in the grave
Tom just told me the opposite.
It's louder!
He was two years younger than me.
I'm sorry.
Tom is dissatisfied.
That would be a pleasure.
It's crazy like electricity.
I'm sorry I didn't respond to your letter earlier.
Don't drink water from a dirty glass.
What do you know about me?
I'm reformed.
I wrote all the songs I sang to you today.
That doesn't scare me at all.
We didn't play well.
How old are you really?
Somebody's here.
Tom asked me if I slept at all last night.
Why is love so complicated?

Tom told me not to talk to Mary.
I love this song.
That's very rare.
What did I just do?
It's best to solve things on the go.
You work too much, sit down and rest a little.
This one's really cool.
Not a word.
I've been enjoying it.
It can be trusted to some extent.
You're a teacher.
I bought a lot of things.
Would you like another glass of water?
My wife's from Keda.
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.
That helps us a lot.
What do you believe in?
I'm sorry, I'm late for a meeting.
What we need is a responsible government, what we have is a circus.
I'm sorry I tried it at all.
That river's slippery, isn't it?
I can keep a secret.

Is this your phone?
I hate Tom.
This one's really cool.
Tom cut the tape.
Do you think the situation will improve?
Who's she?

Get out of there.
Fish can't live out of the water.
I have a book.
Is any of this true?
I had a vision.
Stop giving up! Stop giving up!
I'm cold.
I'm so busy I can't help you.
I have two colors.
Move! Move!

Can you make Tom smile?
Due to bad weather, the plane was late.

I was in a great mood.
I'm a professor.
There's nothing to do in this city.
Tom is a scoundrel.
Turn around for a moment, will you?
The book is on the shelf.
I often feel the heartbeat.

I don't blame you.
They wanted to punish me.
I'm afraid of snakes.
I know that girl from somewhere.
I calmed down once.
Show me the photos!
She dreamed of becoming a nurse.
I'm sorry to always bother you.
Tom's risking everything.
He's a man of power.
That's great!
I'm ugly.
Can you pick us up?
Can you make it on time?
It's strange that the postman hasn't arrived yet.
Try to do one thing at a time.
How can we prevent this from happening?
His novels are a favorite among young people.
There's a cat.
I hope Tom remembers this.
Have I really been so happy?
I'll be buying a boat soon. What kind of insurance should I choose?
Tom said he wouldn't be waiting for us.
Close your eyes, Tom.
She was surprised to hear the news.
He's not an American, he's an Englishman.
How do you say “thank you” in Japanese?
There were no injuries.
Have you ever been punished for fast driving?
I'll be upstairs.
We've got to go.
Tom is a mechanic.

Are we ready to go?
- Why?
The storm shouldn't affect our plans.

Tom looked very confused.
The results were unbelievable.
Choose one.
I'm sorry, I didn't remember your name.
Brakes are blurred.
Are you completely recovering?
He got what he wanted.
I'll listen.
The job was already done.
Tom spoke very loudly.
She drinks like a slug.
Don't move!
The incident was recorded by an observer.
Did I let that go?
Are you happy?
This is the dumbest thing I've ever said.
I wish I knew Tom couldn't speak French.
Tell them we're coming.
Their friendship has gradually turned into love.
There's a saying in China that you can't judge a man by appearance.

What the fuck is going on here?
There are indications that the reception, which is known for its luxurious dishes, will be a bit more modest this year.
Did you report it to the police?
He gave up.
Italy is a very beautiful country.
What's wrong with you?
You lied to me, didn't you?
I hope Tom does that.
Tom and I were friends.
I hope you and Tom have a good time.
Where are you going?
I'm sorry if I let you down.
Violent criminals were often rapists in childhood.

Look how big it is!
It's a living truth.
You're very unwashed.

Now is a great time to buy one.
You're absolutely right.
He knows the names of all his clients.
Tom got out of it.
Tom's been interfering with people he's never had to interfere with.
Tom visits us from time to time.
Tell me what to write and write.
Tom is ruthless.
Tom was half right.
Tom ran down the street.
That's the problem you have to solve yourself.
I was exaggerating.
The termites eat the tree.
I take vitamins every day.
Tom dropped the book.
This is supposed to work.
You've cheated on me.
You don't have to judge a man by his appearance.
It's unrelated.
Am I in love?
Do you think I missed something?
Thank you for the email!
I said I didn't know what was going on.
They're gonna hold the talks tomorrow.
What's this?
My hands are full.
Tom had no idea I was going to be there.
Tom told me he wouldn't tell Mary what happened.
Don't talk.
The team is as strong as its weakest member.
I've already been there.
And me, too.
It's different than I expected.
Don't lie.
What are your plans, then?
The kids are sleeping.
That was very good.
You need a temporary bridge.
I talked to Tom yesterday.
This city, like many other cities in England, has a fairly long history.
Tom closed the door.
It wasn't fun, so I went home early.
Now it's time for the kids to go to bed.
Where's your stuff?
Tom worked very hard and wasted a lot of money.
I don't like to socialize.
Tom is alone in the living room.
He lived a simple life.
We offered help.
It was a dark and stormy night.
It smells delicious.
The first phase is finished.
You'll be known.
He's got a lot of money, even a lot of money.
We're glad to have you here.
Can I have another glass of beer?
Tom was confident in himself.
Sit down for a moment, please.
It's Copacabana!
I wonder how Tom feels.
She takes care of her old mother.
You're the most accessible person I know.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
I have plants.
I bought dozens of pencils today.
I'm hurt.
Tom stayed with us for a few days.
Are you studying French at your school?
That can't be true.
Tom looked left and right before crossing the street.
Take a picture of this.
Who lives in the neighborhood?
Tom was in the audience.
Tom's gonna get better.
You're important to me.
I don't expect anything from you.
Go straight.
Tell her.
I volunteered.
I don't see the difference.
Don't worry about it.
I'm used to not being liked by anyone.
Brakes are squeezing.
Find Tom.
You really made me proud.
You can see everything in black.
Just like a bean.
Now I'm a little worried.
Do you have a stable relationship with your boyfriend?
Tom still knows how to quote a song he wrote when he was thirteen.
It's empty.
Did you see Tom's gone?
Be careful.
How would you translate that to you?
I'm willing to pay you well to do that.
Where did you get that idea?
What are you talking about?
That was a tough decision.
This is from Australia.
I thought you were gonna be busy.
A lot of people dive into it.
Hopefully tomorrow will be a good time.
Mary was whispering.
Sit down.
Come and check it out.
Tom really seems familiar.
Trier is the oldest city in Germany.
I'm giving up.
Do your kids have their own rooms?
Tom kept all the letters that Mary sent him.
Go swim a little with Tom.
It's safe.
Tom died in a dream.
A woman's chiffon is not complete without a small black dress.
I can't sit quietly.
Finish this.
We have no choice but to kill.
Where's the toilet here?
Happy Awakening!
Tom helped me save some dinar by telling me about a cheaper place to buy it.
I owe you an apology.
There's nothing else you can do but admire him with courage.
I don't have any songs you're talking about.
Tom's been working his whole life.
Knock!
Where are you going?
Maybe you shouldn't have told Tom that.
I need to fix my watch.
Tom will live.
Please read between the rows.
You've won!
That's a bad sign.
I misunderstood.
Tom had dinner with Mary.
Did you just meet her?
I'm nervous.
My mother died the same day I got married.
Isn't that what you wanted?
Am I really so happy?
I'm good with the kids.
I'll be late.
I had lunch at the speed.
You can't buy apples anymore!
There's a lot of traffic on the highway.
You should leave a message to Tom.
You always lie to me.
Just in time!
I want to want what you want.
Health is a wealth.
Tom now has a family.
That doesn't surprise me.
As far as I know, he never came in time.
Sweet dreams!
Someone needs to hire Tom.
Where did you find the keys?
You'll see her.
You're very disrespectful.
The boy throws a stone.
Can I call you in 20 minutes?
Wind is a cheap and clean source of energy.
As little as we know about her origins, at least we can be sure that she is the pilot of the Evangelion.
I'm a terrible writer.
Tom got on the bus.
Can you leave us alone?
I almost forgot my passport.
Why do you do that, if I can ask?
Yelen is faster than stronger.
People used to write books with hitting machines.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
I live in Sarajevo.
I reacted instinctively.
It's the toilet.
There's nothing wrong with letting Mary learn to drive.
Are you coming back now?
I want to fuck you.
I hope it's not.
Give me one example.
How could I hate Tom?
Wear this.
How barbaric!
What day is tomorrow?
That's what I've always known.
Tom thought I was you.
I'm looking forward to your letter.
When cats don't have water, the mice have a water cycle.
We need it from Tom.
Japan is ruled by the Emperor and the King of Spain.
It's Alina's book.
Will we see Tom again?
The world was on the verge of a nuclear war during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962.
Have fun while you can.
I'm sure I'll win that tennis game.
Are you dyslexic?
Melanie's drinking milk.
Where did you see Tom?
It's all quiet again.
I'm bleeding.
Can we order, please?
What's he doing?
Otherwise, what's your address?
What I saw was depressing.
They laughed at me.
I'm pissed.
Just slow down, Tom.
Can you give me an example?
I'm not going to bust with you this weekend.
He stole a very precious diamond ring.
That's my cat.
Tom drinks like a slug.
Like in the old good times.
Tom knew what he wanted.
Is that what you want?
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Don't overdo it.

I saw the bus.
She can't stop us.

Go talk to Tom.
It's your decision.
There's no use trying to convince him.
