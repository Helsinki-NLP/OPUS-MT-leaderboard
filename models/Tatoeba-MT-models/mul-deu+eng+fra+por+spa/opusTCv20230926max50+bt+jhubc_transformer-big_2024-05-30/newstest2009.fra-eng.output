At the end of the exchanges, the Prague Stock Exchange swings in the negative
After the fall on Tuesday morning, the Prague Stock Exchange rectified its losses.
Transactions with <0xC4><0x8C>EZ shares reached almost half of the usual daily exchanges.
On Tuesday, from the start of exchanges, the Prague Stock Exchange resumed with its early fall, when it lost almost six percent.
This time, the decline is due to the fall in Wall Street shares.
The market reaction to the outcome of the vote of the U.S. House of Representatives, which refused to adopt the U.S. financial sector stabilization plan, is also noticeable here.
Fall of shares in Asia
Asian stock exchanges on Tuesday experienced a dramatic drop, even though the indexes managed to erase some of the losses over the course of the day.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange’s Hang Seng index lost four percent during trades, but later wiped out some of the losses and reduced the decline to nearly 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index following the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange lost 3.8 percent, with markets closed in Shanghai.
Sydney’s stocks lost more than five percent, but eventually we managed to reduce the losses to 4.3 percent.
According to its index, the Taiwan Stock Exchange lost 3.6 percent.
“The hesitation about the U.S. bailout will affect financial markets around the world,” said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Monetary Office.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it establishes its own monetary policy, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates are at the same level in Hong Kong as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, U.S. lawmakers should quickly resume negotiations and adopt the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, other countries would be at risk of being affected.
The Bloodbath of U.S. Actions
On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the project to support the financial system, to which it should have allocated up to <0x24>700 billion (nearly <0x24>12 billion).
Legislators therefore denied the call for support for President George Bush’s draft.
According to Bush, the project should solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks on Monday experienced a bloodshed and major stock indexes experienced the biggest drop in the last 20 years.
The Dow Jones index lost nearly seven percent, having experienced a drop of such a magnitude for the last time in 1987.
The index was already losing during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it was in free fall.
Congress Cedes: U.S. Government May Inject <0x24>700 Billion in Banks
U.S. Congress leaders and President George W. Bush’s government have agreed on a broader form of the U.S. financial assistance agreement.
He will be put to the vote at the beginning of next week.
U.S. lawmakers played a decisive role in talks on the adoption of a bailout plan in the form of a <0x24>700 billion (approximately <0x24>12 trillion) financial assistance to the U.S. financial system.
However, success is not as certain.
In fact, before we can publish the final version of the law and put it to the vote, Congressmen must complete a number of details of the agreement.
The financial system support plan will be discussed Monday in the House of Representatives.
Barney Frank, chairman of the House’s Banking and Financial Regulations Committee, said on Sunday.
According to sources, on Wednesday as early as possible, the plan should be a priori subject to a vote in the Senate.
According to economists, the announcement that the rescue plan will be adopted should be a major psychological factor in the recovery of financial markets.
However, given the complexity of the mechanisms by which aid to markets can be effective, there will be a "disillusionment".
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have made great progress.
We have settled our divergent views on the form that the package of measures should have for stabilizing the market," Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, told Bloomberg.
She said the final vote could be held on Sunday.
On the night of Saturday to Sunday, lawmakers met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to give the bottom of the government a final form.
It is expected to redeem from financial companies the immovable real estate assets that cause financial enterprises to substantial losses and threaten the stability of the system as a whole.
"We are on the verge of agreeing on a plan that will work and that must be also effective in the market.
This market recovery plan still needs to be pursued, but I think we are there,” Paulson said.
A signal for Asian exchanges
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on the falling stock markets.
According to Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are ensuring that Congress reaches a final agreement on Sunday.
They want to calm investors before the start of trades on the Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where Congress’ decision could influence Monday’s trades.
At the moment, however, it is impossible to clarify with certainty when the two Houses of Congress will proceed to the vote, or whether the negotiations will not be blocked, at the last moment, by any problem.
Legislators hope that it will be adopted in the coming days.
Nonetheless, the law will be subject to many more amendments.
The total amount allocated to the system shall be divided into two parts.
The first <0x24>350 billion, as President George Bush wanted, must be available as soon as possible.
But if Congress feels that the program is not fulfilling its function, it has the possibility to block the allocation of the remaining amount, following two steps: first an additional <0x24>100 billion, and then, finally, <0x24>350 billion.
Mr. Bush welcomes progress in the negotiations
Although the President may veto this decision, Congress has the opportunity to make it a minority.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the program, which consisted of obtaining funds for the redemption of the wrong real estate securities, whose value fell, because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to pay their mortgages, was maintained.
"All the work is done.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," Republican Senator Judd Gregg said.
U.S. President George Bush himself is pleased with the progress made in the negotiations.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said Bush was pleased with Saturday’s progress and appreciated “the bilateral effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.”
Limitation of golden parachutes
The chairman of the Senate banking committee, Christopher Dodd, the chief negotiator, said the legislators agreed on the responsibility of the financial program, the protection of contributors against losses, the crash agreement, the development of the plan on the time axis.
The new law also provides for limiting these golden parachutes for the directors of the companies participating in the program and set up a committee, which will monitor the fund.
The latter should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We have worked very hard on the issue and have made significant progress towards an agreement that will work and be effective for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also provides assistance for real estate owners, who have problems to pay.
The government should negotiate new deposits in the case of mortgages it will buy, while reducing the monthly salary of the debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: A psychological aid
According to Patria Finance chief economist David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its implementation will be very difficult.
"And this is due to the fact that we don't know what the mechanism and the cost of buying back trouble assets will be.
This will be a decisive point for sharing losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week on the iHNed.cz server.
If the plan is to be adopted now, or at the beginning of next week, Marek says it is not so important.
“It is much more important that Congressmen agree, as of this week, that they support this plan and that they will dedicate it as soon as possible.
This psychological significance of the agreement, providing for the adoption of the plan, is the most important at the moment,” Marek said.
A fight pushed to the extreme: MP3 players against mobiles.
We will advise you, how to choose
While virtually all mobiles can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can phone.
It seems clear that it is better to buy only a phone.
Don’t let enough reasons exist to get an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the mode of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy for the home an expensive high-end phonograph to put on Maxim Turbulenc’s new album.
On the one hand, such musical products do not come out on vinyl disc, and, from a quality point of view, there is no objective reason for this to happen.
Now, if there’s in your shelves a lot of vinyl records, with rock art, jazz or blues, you’re probably dreaming of such a gramophone.
The same is true of music during travel, namely compressed music, to put it simply - from music to MP3.
There are also categories depending on the price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a reader, in the same way a Pink Floyd fan would have trouble with hearing aids purchased for twenty crowns in the market.
Here are two extremes, among which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
Battery life is also decisive
Some high-end music players are capable of much more than just playing music, but these are unknown features, of course, of most mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the first functions, phone calls and SMS sending, it is able to play music and movies, record the latter, it has a camera of varying quality and can, for example, be used for navigation.
And if you take into account smartphones and communicators, you will have a small computer in your pocket.
Since no refrigerator knows how to grill meat and no TV will take photographs, we are virtually witnessing a miracle.
However, the universal character of mobile is not without drawbacks.
The larger the number of functions you use, the smaller the interval between two recharges will be.
And playing music is one of the most important energy bubbles.
Rare are the mobiles that are able to play music for ten to twelve hours, in most cases, this figure is considerably lower.
In this regard, music players (especially the most rudimentary) are significantly more performers.
In the case of cheap mobiles, count on them to play music only for a few hours.
If, in addition, you can call from time to time, make sure, to be sure, a second charger for work - this is even valid for more expensive devices.
The problem will not arise for MP3 players, which are capable, following a recharge, of a continuous operation of at least 9 hours, including the least performing.
Another problem occurs when recording music on your mobile.
Unfortunately, a limited part of the devices have a universal USB connector, especially since not all can be directly connected to the computer, without special software.
Music can, of course, be recorded directly on the memory card, but few card readers know how to take it without reduction, given the small dimensions of the memory cards used in mobile devices.
As for the drives, you do not need any software, except for the exception (iPod).
Simply fill in, through the USB connector, the music device coming from the computer.
Most mobile phones and readers will create their own media library sorted by the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, the style, or at the discretion of the user.
Some devices display only an index with a tree structure, like Windows Explorer, others are capable of both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobiles have more know-how
In choosing a concrete device, you are especially interested in the life of the accumulator, the capacity of the memory, the quality and the type of sound output and, of course, the ease of control.
If the music is for you, essentially, a background noise and if in the day you are going to listen to it only for a limited time, for example by taking the tram, you just need any mobile playing the MP3s.
Almost all mobile devices are capable of doing so today.
You don’t even have to pay too much attention to the music formats that the mobile or the player is capable of playing.
Everyone can play MP3s and the vast majority of the music that will come to you will have just this format.
It is one of the most common formats and apart from it, the vast majority of devices can also play music in WMA format.
The AAC (format used by Apple and its iPods) is less common.
High-end mobiles also allow, for example, to buy music online.
Just visit, from the mobile phone, the corresponding operator’s (or other provider’s) web pages and buy the song or album in question.
This service alone should be a compelling reason to get a musical mobile.
The offer of the operators is unfortunately miserable and is, in most cases, limited to quick-made radio tubes.
The prices are also not the lowest.
However, it is generally considered that this way of buying music (whether through GSM, Internet, or even wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always wear their mobile phones on themselves.
Every time you want to listen to something, you just have to get the mobile out of your pocket, while you’ve forgotten your MP3 player at home.
However, it is also important if you still have headphones on or a handsfree with connection.
If this is not the case, you can use the built-in speakers, which have virtually all mobile phones, but a minimum of MP3 players.
For many, the main advantage of musical mobile is their price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than 3,000.
For a price of three or four thousand crowns, you can have a very convenient walkman already.
But in most cases, you will be limited by the lack of output for regular headphones.
The price of the best phones and the best tools, also provided with an input for ordinary headphones, does not exceed fifteen thousand.
Readers, on the other hand, have the advantage of having an easy command.
Indeed, anyone can ensure the order of the most rudimentary readers - which do not necessarily correspond to the least expensive (see our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the similarity of the command with that of a cassette station, commonly used in the past, or a gramophone, is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of a randomly connected mobile internet, followed by a huge data transmission bill.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g. the Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (type M2, microSD, and so on).
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
Basic models generally only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive ones come out even with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, a Emgeton, or an iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you should not spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you are one of the most demanding listeners, instead choose specialized walkman mobiles (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are equipped with independent control keys for MP3, and so the ease of the control approaches that of an independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles in the Walkman series have the same user menu as MP3 players sold separately, is the one that went the most far in this area.
The same service, in the same price category, but with a memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a longer battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours), is provided by an MP3 player produced by one of the above brands.
A first virtual operator will win the Czech Republic this year.
Possibly
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively advanced, with our operators offering virtually the same services as their Western European partners.
Despite this, we still lack something - a virtual operator, which would force the classic operators to lower prices.
It may not be missing for a long time.
We have already mentioned, on several occasions, on Mobil.cz the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
The <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> (Czech Telecommunications Office), which reported that the price of an SMS was higher in our country than in the rest of the Union, confirmed it.
Thus, following the European Commission's last steps in the field of the regulation of roaming fees, a paradoxical situation is likely to occur - SMS sent from abroad will be cheaper for some customers of Czech mobile operators than in the country.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high, compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that would really want to enter the fight.
This may seem paradoxical, since we still have three mobile networks and a penetration that far exceeds 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this case, Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99>ák, the Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>), who has repeatedly stated that in the Czech Republic there is no room for another operator, choruses with the operators.
It’s probably true that a classic operator with its own network apparently doesn’t have much luck anymore (by the way, now it’s hard to find frequencies).
But there is still a possibility - a virtual operator.
It is precisely the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that has led to a considerable drop in prices, to which they would subsequently have to react as well.
Yet even before disturbances such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the market, voices similar to those we hear today at home were heard in the UK.
But it turned out that there was still room for such operators and that they could have a real success.
We are not obliged to go too far to find examples.
In February we informed you about the launch of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just six months, this operator has managed to win more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth operator in the country.
Let’s add that behind Mobilking, there is the financial group Penta, which owns the U:fon in the Czech Republic, among others.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more concrete target group.
In order for their operation to be efficient, they need much less customers than a conventional operator.
They are, in fact, exempt from the relatively high costs of construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
This is how virtual operators around the world profile themselves as low-cost operators – they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often counterbalanced by a limited service offering.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers SMS in the UK at least twice as cheap as its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, betting on an unusual target group can also be a good advertising hit.
In fact, this operator is specifically aimed at men.
“Real men choose Mobilking – an operator they like and can trust,” says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, who operates this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say, if such a concept would be likely to work in our home as well.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> said: “The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
Especially since it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the service offering."
In the Czech Republic, no chance, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are discussing the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations are not very encouraging.
The launch of Mobilking will rather take place in other countries in our area," said Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ková, a spokeswoman for Penta Financial Group, in a telephone interview for Mobil.cz.
It thus indirectly confirmed that the operators in the Czech Republic were, at any rate, not in favour of this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do their best so that a potential competitor may not appear.
GTS Nowera Group, which would like to take a new step to become a real competitor of Telefónica in the corporate customer sector, has not hidden, for quite a long time, its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator.
“We want to be able to offer our customers not only fixed telecommunications services, but also mobile.
And the sooner it will be the best.
We have already negotiated this possibility on several occasions with all Czech mobile operators.
With some, we managed to move forward in the negotiations,” said Group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
Perhaps the future is promising.
According to non-official information, it seems that we might be able to host the first virtual operator by the end of the year.
But for the moment, his creation is accompanied by total silence.
“At the moment, we do not believe that there is room in the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is very specific compared to others.
So far, no subject with a complex and serious project in this area has contacted us," said Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88> of the Telefónica O2 press department, in his statement to Mobil.cz.
Other operators also refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová said in a rare agreement with O2's statement: "We have not recorded for the moment a viable and bilaterally advantageous project, which could serve as a basis."
She added: “It is virtually excluded that a virtual operator will appear in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
In order to operate in such a limited period of time, we should now have a concrete agreement."
Vodafone instead focuses on fulfilling requests to obtain its own 3G license.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> says: “We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, especially in the field of shared costs and infrastructure.
This is what we believe means the most input from the point of view of customers.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is the discovery of a partner to establish a common network for fast mobile internet.”
Responsible authorities: in phase with operators
The approach of mobile operators is easily understandable, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would have led to a decrease in prices and therefore to a decrease in their profit.
What good is it to facilitate the advent of such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests, the operators can hear each other like a fair. The chicane accompanying the creation of the U:fon also bears witness to it.
The largest apparent pressure on the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, when U:fon was created, was that exerted by T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by information accessible to the public from the <0xC4><0x8C>TU web pages.
Nowadays, U:fon is ready to serve as an argument to not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová commented: "Mobile market competition has also recently been amplified by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the nature of the mobile market in RT, it is obvious that the entry of an additional player would subject it, and especially its services, to high demands."
But given the attitude of the mobile operators, the indifference of the Czech regulatory bodies seems to be confounding.
However, this is not just the attitude of the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, which, unlike Britain and other developed countries, unfortunately, does not have the power to intervene in economic competition in the Czech Republic.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (OECD).
However, the latter adopted, in the face of this problem, its typical position.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible as a result of the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator concerned regarding the lease of the necessary infrastructure.
No such agreement has been concluded at the moment, as the offer of potential stakeholders has not a priori presented sufficient interest to the classic operators," said in response to our question Kristian Chalupa of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS Department of Foreign Relations.
A statement thus made would not be surprising on the part of operator representatives.
But on the part of an office, which must represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, take care to ensure that no one benefits from its position on the market, such a statement is more than disturbing.
As Kristián Chalupa adds, “Overall, where virtual operators are normally present, it can be seen that their entry into the market has contributed to a decrease in the prices of mobile phone services.”
However, pressuring for a fair functioning of the market and a price drop is apparently not part of the interests of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
What is really shocking is the almost touching concord of the three mobile operators, which results from their reactions.
The question, if this is really a coincidence, comes naturally.
Similarly, a price of gasoline strictly identical to all gas stations is probably due to chance and fierce competition.
"The agency has not detected any signs of anti-competitive behaviour in this regard, so it has no reason to intervene in one way or another.
None of the operators has a dominant position, and none therefore has an increased corresponding responsibility for their market behaviour.
The tools needed to open the mobile market to virtual operators are probably missing even the telecommunications regulator," Chaloupa said in a statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many points of disagreement.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, according to which telecommunications constitute, from the point of view of economic competition, a single market.
None of the Czech operators has a dominant position in such a market.
However, some legal experts propose a different view of things: for the creation of a virtual operator to be possible, it is necessary to obtain, each time, the consent of the network operator.
And the mobile operator logically has the monopoly on its network.
This is how it necessarily plays a dominant role in a certain segment of its activity.
However, even without admitting this argument, it should be at least troubling for the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS that three mobile operators are visibly acting in a similar manner.
However, the complaints of many interested parties (including GTS Novera, already mentioned) show that they face similar constraints in negotiations with all operators.
Taking responsibility back on the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> is a fairly common thread in communications, whereby the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS washes its hands of the case.
We have encountered this type of attitude in a number of similar cases.
Unfortunately, the recent renewal of the Telecommunications Act did not bring about an enlargement of the <0xC4><0x8C>TU's powers in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many specialists promised an improvement in the situation.
The representatives of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS must know this very well, but their interests are apparently elsewhere.
When no one looks, it can work.
That said, the operation of a kind of pseudo-virtual operator, several in Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These are companies that publish their own price lists for mobile phone services, but these are only partially public.
In most cases, it is a question of multi-level marketing companies.
For example, personalized mobile phone services are offered by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these firms usually only reach voters.
The magic tower consists in the fact that the company does in front of the operator figure of a classic business client, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, she gets special price (and other) offers.
The problem is that the trade conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such a resale.
"If what you are referring to happened, it could be a breach of the contractual terms that we would examine and which could result in a termination of the collaboration with the company in question," said Martina Kemrová.
However, it is quite unlikely that an echo of such an activity did not reach the responsible mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned, it can be thousands of customers.
None of the operators, however, is against such a procedure.
Indeed, the activities of these firms bring them non-negotiable profits, and at the same time, unlike real virtual operators, they do not threaten them at all with their own official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> points out the possible problems: "The law allows such speculation, however, the services of these companies are used only by a negligible percentage of customers.
In addition, they are forced to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not registered under their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it, in the manner of ordinary customers of mobile operators."
But that is exactly what should seem strange to the <0xC4><0x8C>TU.
In addition, another question is asked at the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes on such a procedure, why are they blocking the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS has relatively broad powers to be able to disclose such an activity, and if it does not wish to be content with the explanations of the operators, who claim to have no idea that this would happen, their contractual terms prohibit it.
When we will no longer be the most expensive country
As we have already mentioned on several occasions, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought about a considerable reduction in the price of services.
Now, in virtually all countries where virtual operators appeared, classic operators were trying, sometimes more, sometimes less, to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by the latter were virtually the same - a market too small, or even too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
It is precisely at this level that the regulatory bodies in the developed countries have intervened, which did not defend the interests of the mobile operators, but those of their customers.
Both by formal measures and by informal pressure, they eventually obtained the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are dealing with this issue in the same way as a hot potato, which can be disposed of by sending it to a nearby target.
Following the experiences we have, we can only get rid of the impression that the confusion in their skills is more than profitable in these cases.
But don't throw the handle after the cognac.
If the background information is true and a virtual operator will appear soon at us, the Czech mobile market may be back on the move.
If one of the operators has accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS will hardly be able to remain impatient in the face of the rejection (discrimination) of other stakeholders.
And perhaps we will stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to the four achievements of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, on the occasion of Czech National Day, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov m<0xC5><0xAF>j (Where is my country?).
The hymn was once again recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99>í B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek.
We have four versions - with a male or female solo song, a choir interpretation and an instrumental version.
The song is composed by Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>ínková and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremias and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek are the authors of the arrangements of the hymn.
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.cz server.
B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek considers the Czech national anthem as one of the most beautiful hymns.
As he had previously entrusted <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> rozhlas (the Czech public radio), he chose for the interpretation of the solo versions of singers with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
"From the beginning, I was trying to make sure that both singers, as well as the choir, have a good diction, so that the words are well understood, that they sing simultaneously," he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov m<0xC5><0xAF>j retents for the first time in 1834 on the boards of the Stavovské divadlo (the Theatre of the States) in Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka (Kermesse of the Savers), original Czech play by Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by music by Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>krup.
It has become popular and people have spontaneously appropriated it.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first couple naturally became an integral part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" anthem sounds
Prague public transport (MHD) will introduce the chip into their ticketing system on Wednesday
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, it will be inscribed in the history of the Pra<0xC5><0xBE>sk<0xC3><0xBD> Dopravní podnik (Pra<0xC5><0xBE>sk<0xC3><0xBD> Dopravní podnik) as the date on which the metro, trams and buses will be the first passengers, who, instead of having a paper ticket, will have an electronic coupon in their pocket.
At the moment, the latter is accessible to approximately one hundred thousand people, the owners of the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy a 30-day or 90-day coupon (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time make it registered on their chip card in the information points and offices of the Dopravní podrnik (the Transport Agency), located in the metro stations Muzeum, Luhj, M<0xC5><0xAF>st<0xC4><0x9B>ka, Kostek, Kayrada and Rozdra<0xC5><0xBE>erov.
As of yesterday, there is also the possibility to buy coupons online on the website of the Dopravní podnik: www.dpp.cz.
More than 400 people took advantage of the service in the morning.
Those who will begin to use the online store can permanently forget the stalls in the metro stations, where they had to walk impatiently in long queues in order to get paper tickets.
In fact, they will buy their coupon online and save it on their Opencard card in one of the thirteen M<0xC4><0x9B>stská knihovna (municipal libraries).
"At these points of contact, there is a ticket for passengers with trained staff, which will help those interested in online purchases and, in addition, save the coupon they bought on their card," said project spokesman Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>.
In addition to libraries, it will also be possible to save electronic coupons on the Opencard in automatic distributors installed in the lobby of several metro stations.
What do these distributors look like?
They are red, reminding the composing machines of the tickets and the passengers may have already noticed them in the subway stations Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Today, the city has five of them, but by the end of the year, there should be ninety of them," Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD> added.
A vending machine will control the coupon in place of the driver
The machines that will work from tomorrow are easy to use.
Simply enter the Opencard chip card and the previously purchased coupon will be saved on the card itself.
Electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the surroundings of the city.
In the periurban trains and bus lines 300 to 499, which are mainly used by the inhabitants of the municipalities of central Bohemia to access the capital.
"In the integrated trains in Pra<0xC5><0xBE>ská integravaná doprava (integrated transports from Prague), the controllers are equipped with card readers, with the help of which they establish the temporary and zone validity of coupons;" explained the control of the tickets of the communal drivers Filip Drápal, who in Ropiis's organization.
The periurban buses are equipped with card readers integrated into the driver’s box.
When boarding, it is therefore necessary not only to show the chip card to the driver, but it is also necessary to place the Opencard in the place indicated on the side of the box.
This is how the driver checks the validity of the registered coupons.
"In case the passenger would need to verify the validity of the registered coupons, there is nothing simpler than asking for this information from the driver," Drápal added.
Passengers who do not take suburban buses and will not remember the date on which their coupon expires, can rejoin the ATMs, originally used to save coupons on the map.
It is there, on the screen of the device, that information about the validity of their document will appear.
U.S. Suddens Call for Referendum
In 1945, the Germans of the Sudden demanded that <0xC5><0xA0>umava be integrated into the United States.
This stems from a letter deposited in the collections of the Jiho<0xC4><0x8D>eská v<0xC4><0x9B>decká knijovna (The Scientific Library of the South Bohemia).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to at least live under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, some groups of German Sudetens allegedly addressed the president of the United States with such a desire.
This is due, among other things, to a letter preserved in a private archive, which is now deposited in the collections of the Jiho<0xC4><0x8D>eská védecká knihovna.
The Germans of <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Krumlov pray in the letter to the US president not to allow "<0xC5><0xA1>umavská <0xC5><0xBE>upa" (forest region south of Bohemia) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich Agreement - to be returned to Czechoslovakia.
“We understand the situation well and we want to be sure that the words that proclaim that American troops come to German territory are not oppressors and enemies, but liberators,” the letter reads, “Persones, to whom the fate of the <0xC5><0xA0>umava belongs.”
Given that the rally in Czechoslovakia is supposedly promising - knowing the Czech national character - only of brutality, unbiased attitude, misunderstanding, oppression and servitude, now the authors of the letter ask the American president to always take in his hands for protection and <0xC5><0xA0>ora.
“We cannot believe that you would grant this territory to a foreign state to us, which oppresses and destroys minorities and has contributed nothing to the Allied victory without taking into account the opinion of a quarter of a million people,” the letter reads.
The alleged reason why the authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire for revenge of the "Czech oppressors".
If the President of the United States doubted the opinion of the Germans of <0xC5><0xA0>umava, he would only have to organize, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to establish whether his inhabitants wanted to be part of the United States, or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text contained in the letter may, given the current knowledge of post-war history, seem somewhat naive, according to some survivors, it well illustrates the expectations of the Germans of the Sudeten era.
While the Czech Germans had to at least see that the question of their expulsion from the republic would arise, very few of them supported such a possibility.
Some expected that the United States and Great Britain would obtain some kind of autonomy for the Sudetenlands.
Others believed that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice, confirms it.
During the war, he was, as a German of <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice, engaged in the navy in the Baltic countries.
When at the end of the war, he was captured by the English and placed in the Holstein area capture camp, dozens of Czech Germans came to see him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that once they returned home, the Czech would be profitable for them," says Chalupa.
None of the captured Germans living in Czechoslovakia before the war believed that he would be expelled from the republic following the Bene<0xC5><0xA1> Decrees.
You don't think - you pay!
An Emotional Campaign to Attack Drivers
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
A way to characterize the emotional media campaign with the intention of launching, Wednesday, the Ministry of Transport.
The office of Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>ebí<0xC4><0x8D>ek believes it will discourage drivers from dangerous driving behavior.
This <0x24>150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, on the internet, but also on tracts.
It should discourage drivers from fast driving and alcohol at the wheel.
But also remind them to take the belt before starting.
It wants above all to touch the awareness of young drivers, motorists, pedestrians, without forgetting professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially personal stories that are going to attack emotions.
It also bears witness to the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
You don't think - you pay!
The phrase "You don't think" is written in capital letters on the registration plate.
Then, in a cup of blood, there's the phrase "Tu pagaras".
This must symbolize that one can pay from life a moment of inattention.
The spots will "handle" viewers until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where images with drastic images of the victims of accidents can be seen in common.
It is estimated that this will lead to a decrease in the rate of accidents and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
The strategy of sugar and whistleblowers against drivers
"What works with the drivers is the sugar and whistle-blower system.
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by saving time, when grilling a red fire.
The strike is the threat of a fine or accident.
Risks should be reminded to drivers,” says Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99>án, transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
This is how we need information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertisements, the psychologist believes.
Panels signaling the danger to drivers are already less effective.
“When a static panel warning of danger is installed, it will probably quickly merge with the environment and drivers will not notice it anymore,” Ko<0xC5><0x99>án said.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace.
Ehud Olmert, the President of the Israeli Provisional Government, spoke in favour of the restitution of virtually all occupied territories in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made this statement in an interview published Monday by the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.
“We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, or even all,” Olmert said.
“We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to give the Palestinians an analogous percentage (of the Israeli territory), since without it, peace will not be done,” he added.
He admits that the possible restitution would include East Jerusalem.
"He who desires security in Jerusalem, and most of all does not want tractors and bulldozers to crush his feet, as it happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem," Olmert noted, referring to the two people in the city, who were attacked by several people, and who were killed by several bulldozers.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, the sacred and historic places" located inside the Old Town.
“Anyone who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will be forced to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won't work," he said later.
Retreat of the Golan Heights
Olmert also expressed his support for Israel's retreat from the Golan Heights, which he believes is an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
However, this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to conclude peace with Syria only on the basis of a Golan retirement," he said.
“The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up to get the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relations with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hezbollah (the Shia movement); they will have to give up the constant support they give to terrorism by Hamas (the Shia movement), al-Qaeda (the former terrorist network of the Islamic State), and the former leader of the Islamic State.
Questions that arise after the accident: Are the stewards in the car illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long distance is forbidden.
In the context of the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency company near Padua, Italy, the question arises whether the stewards and passengers can move within the bus during the journey.
“If we wanted to comply with the law in a strict and formal way, the activity of a steward is contrary to the Road Traffic Act,” said Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in question, during which a 22-year-old hostess died, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck that crossed the bus road.
The young girl was unfortunately sitting next to the driver, on the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she had two other seats at her disposal.
However, the bus may have an accident, or even a sudden braking, even when the steward serves the coffee or distributes the newspapers.
What matters is whether the bus is under its technical sheet equipped with standing seats or not.
If this standing-seat equipment is not approved, passengers must remain seated.
The long-distance Student Agency buses do not have standing seats; which was confirmed in Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz by the director of the company Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura.
“This is an issue that we have dealt with with with the ministry and, in the beginning, it banned any travel of passengers.
Then they canceled it and we got that passengers can go to the toilet during the trip provided they have their own seat," he said.
The law ignores the stewards.
"There is no unambiguous legal interpretation of the role of steward - no legal requirement is concerned with that role.
On the other hand, no legal requirement prohibits the carrier from offering services.
The Road Transport Act only knows the term of vehicle receiver; it does not define its rights and duties,” added the spokesman, Hanzelka.
Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, the Director of the Department of Road Vehicle Traffic, believes, on the contrary, that the law adequately addresses the issue.
“It all depends on whether the bus has permission to offer standing seats in its approval.
Everything is in there," he said.
Buses are divided into urban, where there are standing seats and a limited maximum speed, interurban with standing seats and a higher permissible speed, and long-distance buses without a standing position with the highest permissible speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
As in the plane, an expert said.
Jaroslav Ho<0xC5><0x99>ín, an expert at BESIP (Road Traffic Safety) in Transportation, does not see the movement of stewards on board as a major problem.
"With regular traffic, there is no danger. The situation can be compared to that of the service in aircraft.
There too, it is not certain when turbulence will occur and the hostess of the air may shake her head."
Or, in the event that the bus suddenly braked, the laws of physics would obviously be valid.
In the same way as in an urban bus or in a tram.
The carrier must manage the security of the stewards by internal regulations," he says and also believes that from the point of view of the law, the issue is not resolved.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is ready to remove these services
Student Agency is the only bus carrier to offer steward services.
He hired two hundred.
Even after this accident, the director does not consider their profession as a risky profession.
"However, as soon as I have the impression that this is a risky profession, I will delete it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and newspapers on board.
This would also reduce costs,” he said.
The safety concern is the reason given to the absence of stewards in his vehicles by the director of the Asiana Alexei Litvine, who ensures, in comparison with SA, a very small number of lines.
"We don't have hostesses, we've been opposed to this since the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in a deadly accident," he said, a year ago, at T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz.
A huge tragedy has come.
A young hostess from the Plze<0xC5><0x88> region, who had worked for the company for two years, died in the accident on the Naples line.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency stopping strip without using a flashlight and blocked the road to the bus.
The driver of the latter tried to avoid it by means of a sudden maneuver, but he rolled it on his right side.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura denied that the two seats reserved for the stewards were sold.
"In the case of long-distance lines, it is not possible to book these seats, they are blocked."
The company intends to file a complaint against the truck driver.
For the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the judgement of the court, but in terms of financial compensation, it also counts on the culprit.
An amendment to the law?
Not in view
An amendment to the law, which has been being drafted for more than a year by a group of thirty experts from the Ministry of Transport, could provide clarification on the movements of the stewards on board the bus.
"Or, she has not reached any conclusions on this point.
In fact, she is not too interested in buses, but rather in the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of the laptop at the steering wheel," says expert Ho<0xC5><0x99>ín.
"The Department of Transportation does not consider the activity of the stewards as something that would fundamentally jeopardize the safety of passengers," said Hanzelka, stating that the control of the safety of buses is under the control of the police and the Occupational Safety Office.
The hopes of Düsseldorf rest on Frankfurt.
The big words were not lacking in the letter from the WestLB Board of Directors to the House employees.
By joining the entities of the Düsseldorf financial institution with the Deka-Bank of Frankfurt, "the central financial market institution of the Sparkasse financial group" could constitute itself, according to the mail released on Monday.
The WestLB would bring a "competence block" doubled with sustainable productivity in such a case.
Overall, such a relationship could be a decisive move towards other concentrations in the Länder banking sector.
This is what it looks like when a steering committee wants to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
Because the WestLB, wounded, is always under strong pressure.
It is not only the European Commission, but also the Federal Financial Services Surveillance Authority that has, only recently, made it clear to the Government of the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia that time was counting in the search for a future solution.
However, it has been questioning for some time already - also on the Frankfurt side - a relationship of any form between the bank Deka, which knows the customers of the Sparkasse by their investment funds, and the WestLB.
It is certain that Deta-Bank chief Franz Waas announced during the presentation of the figures for the end of August that he saw no sense in the merger of the Mainzer Landstrasse house with a Land bank, whether it be the Helaba or the WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka, each half of which is supported by the banks of the Länder and by the savings box groups, commissioned the Steering Committee to conduct discussions with the WestLB for joint business activities.
It could then be the debt of the financial market, or parts of it.
The talks, however, have only just begun, it is said in the financial place.
This is not the first time that Deta-Bank, with its 3,000 employees, is one of the most important employers in Frankfurt’s financial place, and is at stake in the consolidation of the savings box sector.
In 2003, it was believed for a while that Deta-Bank could merge with Land Rhineland-Palatinate and Halbab Bank.
However, nothing has emerged from this ternary bouquet.
The plans had hardly been made public that the government of the Land of Hesse was against any Hellaba participation in them.
Later, the other two houses also did not join.
The Land Bank of Rhineland Palatinate was attached to the Land Bank of Baden-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been new treaties on the regrouping of the Deka-Bank with banks from Länder.
Lastly, however, Günther Merl, chairman of the Hellaba Board of Directors, had decided against any merger strategy with his bank.
In spite of this, there seems to be a widespread feeling that the grouping of the various public sector institutions is particularly urgent.
Now that the elections to the Land of Bavaria Parliament have passed, a union of BayernLB with the Land of Baden-Wuttenberg bank could be achieved first and foremost.
For Helaba, this is not particularly good news.
If the pressure for further mergers was to increase, potential partners would gradually escape it.
In the South, it would now be a junior partner, although it has so far resisted the crisis better than the banks of Munich and Stuttgart.
Hesse-Thuringe, which holds 85 percent of Helaba’s capital, has, on the other hand, closed its entire alliance with the WestLB at the beginning of the year.
The NordLB would remain strict.
Such geo-strategic reflections, however, reflect only one of the facets.
Another aspect raises the question of how the different business models of each of these banks can fit together.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question, namely, by which business model the future capacity of the Länder banks should be ensured, had not been resolved so far by the German grouping of savings and transfers.
In the end, a WestLb disembarkation could take place, disembarkation which is obviously not desired here.
This is also the case in the letter of the current Steering Committee: in any case, a 'global solution' for the establishment would be aimed at.
How all this will be put in the same basket with the union of certain entities with the Deta-Bank remains to be seen.
The second weekend of the beer festival is also known as the Italian weekend.
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena accompanies her as a girlfriend, and so nothing is the same, he says.
Behind them, near a five-litre barrel of Kaiser branded beer, stands a well-built beard that shows about 200 visitors to the beer party what deep sounds his gosier can produce.
Elena tapes Luca first, then kisses her.
From Bologna, they came to Verona.
From there, from the bus station near Puorta nova station, four buses take the departure tonight at 23:45, `destinazione Monaco, festa della berra', arrival scheduled at 6:30.
Three buses are reserved primarily for Italians, in one of the buses travel exclusively from Brazilians.
In a corner of the parking lot, South Americans sing bears and already next to their flag, they already celebrated last night.
And also noisy, explains Marco Guarda, it is not for Italians.
The buses belong to Marco, who wears a long coat with fake fur and glasses with wide silver mounts.
For five years, they have been going to the beer party, already three turned nothing but this year.
They go there at night, stay the day at the party, and come home at 10:30 p.m.
Spending the night there would involve unnecessary expenses, explains Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome pot with a Kaiser beer, brewed in accordance with Bavarian purity law, health insurance and a German-speaking group manager - Marco has taken a language course in Frankfurt.
And already the buses run at night on the Autostrada direction `Brennero'.
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly, everything becomes calm in the bus, the passengers sleep.
Better yet, they will still need their strength.
Breaks will be made in Bressanone, and in Holzkirchen, while a large number of other buses with Italian registration plates make once again a break just before Munich, on Highway 8.
When early in the morning, Marco’s group finally arrives at six o’clock thirty as planned on the parking lot near Thérèse Square, nearly 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco holds a final speech, explains the attack plan.
First of all: hair from the little yellow hat.
On it is written on the left `Beer Festival', in Gothic, and next to the internet address of the travel agency of Marco `conoscersiviaggiando.it".
“When the doors of the beer chapel open, you run,” says Marco in the early morning.
`Run!' Run and reserve seats at the bottom of the tent.
‘Not in front, otherwise you block, and not all the yellow hats on the same benches, you have to distribute them in the room!’
The cup, says Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the record!
`Show the security officers that we behave well!
As soon as you leave your seats, they’re gone!”
Thirdly, 'Tonight, to be back here at ten and a half hours!' Understood?
And that's it, it went to the beer party.
On the way, someone knots from the yellow hats to the trees to find the way back, to the signs and even to an electoral poster of a large Bavarian popular party.
We want to be ready for the return.
This is the second weekend of the beer festival, known as the ‘weekend of the Italians’.
There are no precise figures; 50,000 are said to be embarking on a journey through the Alps and crashing into the beer kiosk, 10 percent of visitors would have come directly from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police are reinforced by seven South Tyrol police officers, by Italian volunteer rescuers who support the Bavarian Red Cross, which compiles statistics on the countries where Italians rank first in front of British (60 interventions) and Austrians (about 80) with nearly 200 medical interventions.
The one that is particularly appreciated by Italians is the tent of the Hofbräu brewery.
Nights of Insomnia for Hypo Real Estate Shareholders
The German banking system is relatively stable, the Federal Finance Minister insisted just a few weeks ago.
What a chance the politician used the word 'relatively' and slipped that the German banking sector would not be spared by the crisis movements.
This has actually happened this weekend.
Bavaria real estate financer Hypo Real Estate (HRE), alongside the DAX, gets a <0x24>1 billion loan from a consortium of German banks to protect itself from market turbulence.
A person in confidence of the situation told Reuters on Monday that aid credits were issued up to a sum of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>35 billion.
The Hipo Real Estate is now expected to pay interest on the fraction to which it would thus be entitled.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
In the background, it is the Deffa subsidiary that bears the losses.
According to a newspaper article, the state financer had refinanced himself in the very short term for long-term projects for which he had borrowed money - which is no longer possible since mistrust of markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's liquidity reserve had been reduced from 95 per cent to EUR 2.37 million, and the equity rate had also slightly decreased from 1.6 per cent to 1.45 per cent.
The current and net profits from financial transactions fell to zero compared with the same period the previous year, the profits from the allocation of fixed liabilities and securities as well as the termination of provisions in credit transactions had dropped from more than 5 million to 70 million.
And it is only thanks to the significant profits derived from the reimbursement of downstream accounting costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group, as well as the reimbursement of interest according to the book of tax procedures and commercial purchases for Konzern companies that the deficit of earnings is about 16 percent.
After its privatization in 1990, the former state financer had initially misspent on industrial real estate credits, which had then been affiliated with Aareal Bank.
Due to the insufficient profitability of conventional state funding, Depfa has subsequently been more involved in infrastructure projects and in joint projects between private and state investors (Privat-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
On the value of the subsidiary, the Hypo Real Estate must make amortizations that should have on the calculation of the group's gains and losses an essential material effect that remains quite blurred nonetheless.
The fact is that the dividends were amputated.
As of 2007, they had been reduced to two-thirds.
Since the acquisition of Depfa, Hypo Real Estate has been a very important state and infrastructure investor.
It is more robust than other institutions dependent on refinancing in the interbank market since it does not have any customer deposits.
With the bankruptcy of investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the allocation of loans between banks has risen again considerably, with banks accumulating their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs an annual share of Depfa’s total credits of a short-term refinancing medium – about 50 billion euros.
According to a statement from the Hypo Real Estate, the group’s financing needs are covered with medium-term credit and the company protected from the influence of international financial markets largely out of the current state of play.
Other sources say that refinancing would be provided through the funds until the end of 2009.
On the other hand, HRE’s chairman, Georg Funke, explained that the Hypo Real Estate group should no longer have recourse to medium-term financial markets.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Financial Services Surveillance Institute (Bafin) are based on the principle that the capacity of the Hypo Real Group in the market is now secured.
The bank’s shareholders and creditors have nothing to do with it.
However, given the dynamics and impossibility of the crisis, there is no certainty.
Moreover, it is not unthinkable that funding should not be used in its entirety.
But the opposite cannot also be discarded.
After the bank is, according to the latest reports, still on the doorstep of insolvency on Sunday evening, this at least temporary rescue will not be able to reassure the spirits either.
The price of the share fell from 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
Bond prices, on the other hand, are particularly good.
While the debts to the first boss have barely moved, the prices of the second-floor loans are floating.
The most affected are the investment funds of the former Württemberg Hypo subsidiary and of course those that have a lifespan beyond 2009.
Hypo Real Estate bonds used to appear to be an alternative speculation investment, but now their value has to be seen as dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net hardening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institution itself that brought the crisis into the establishment by the buyout bank.
As long as issuing institutions, governments and less affected commercial banks are still ready to support the system, it can be assumed to re-absorb downturns over time.
Or it will happen what no one dares hope at this time - that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months.
But in the face of the renewed noises of partial nationalization, the probability that security was approaching has now become a mere grounded hope.
This should reserve nights of insomnia first and foremost to long-term creditors on the decision of whether they should separate from their commitments.
Short-term investors can still use what they have drawn on to constitute a loss postponement for the upcoming years on the upcoming capital gains tax automatically collected.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Box in Bento
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is scheduled to show up for the first day at Tachibana Highschool, the girls start laughing: the German is so "kawaii"!
What's that supposed to mean?
Sylvana already knew this word thanks to the Mangas - in her new exchange log, she talks about Japan.
"The first day of class in Japan.
What was it that I was excited about?
Already the way to go to school scared me.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and take the train 40 minutes to Tachibana High School.
I had to find my way alone, fortunately I didn’t get lost.
The beginning of the courses does not seem to be as strict as ours in Lower Saxony.
Students show up one after the other from eight hours, until nine less twenty hours, a table tour starts with the teacher, the "home room".
But before the class started, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I don’t like talking in front of people at all, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
As I didn’t have the school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt from my host mother, as well as a shirt, blue socks and black leather shoes.
So in this outfit, I presented myself to the pupil, and tried to say everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that time, I was very happy to have started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class all made low masses, laughed and made signs, and I constantly heard the word "Kawaii."
I already knew him thanks to my manga.
It belongs to the vocabulary indispensable for the survival of Japanese teens and means "mignon, chou".
Then I quickly slipped into my place.
The girl next to me made me a big ironic smile, she felt it was an honor that the correspondent should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was pretty calm, but when the gong resonated, I was assaulted in the rules.
Everyone was talking to someone better, laughing and asking me a lot of questions – in this case, it’s quite difficult to understand Japanese English.
During the break, they all took out their Bento.
My host mother had also made me this kind of Lunchbox - it's really something different than the miserable Germans.
I had rice with aromatic herbs, small sausages, a salad of cucumbers and algae, fruits and a kind of meat surrounded by tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea exactly what I eat here in Japan.
Things have a strange appearance and a completely new taste.
What is certain is that everything is really good.
Well, except maybe the salted prunes, brrrrr!
The Bentos are not just lunches in Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl offers a boy a Bento that she prepared herself, and that is then prepared especially carefully - in the hope of being able to get to know the boy a little better during the break.
I read this in my manga.
I'm curious to know if I could watch it here too.
"Why Japan in particular?" my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo.
Then I always replied:
"Because it fascinates me, what"
After all, reading manga is what I’ve preferred for years.
And in order to better understand the manga and the culture that is in it, at some point, I also started learning Japanese.
For me, it was really clear that I had to travel there one day.
Because I also have a low for traditions, US and customs.
And here, they are given a lot of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is harsh, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I have never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen.”
Rats also have sensations.
A rat or a coward flees from danger, does that mean that he is also afraid?
The neurophysicist Joseph LeDoux is convinced of this: many animals also have sensations.
But how can we verify that he feels the same when he behaves the same way we do?
In the online magazine "Edge", contributions have been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of articles the answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else having been able to prove it so far just as one cannot prove that other human beings have consciousness.
But in that case, we can at least hope that all human brains have the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and address the issues of feeling or consciousness in general, we penetrate hard-to-practice terrain because the Hardware does not match.
When a rat is in front of a danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it kills, escapes or attacks.
Humans behave the same way, which is why some scientists deduce a comparable subjective life.
However, I don't believe it.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make it difficult to transpose our subjective life into that of animals.
One aspect is that circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the prefrontal lateral cortex (due to its participation in short-term memory and management and execution functions).
This vast region is much more developed in humans than in other primates and appears to be completely absent in other beings.
Therefore, at least for these aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the consciousness of who we are, and the ability to predict and decide, it is reasonable to assume that human beings differ even from other primates.
Another significant peculiarity could reside in the linguistic nature of man: much of his existence being linked to language, this often means that his consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness should not depend on language, it would certainly influence it, so that animal consciousness, no matter how it is produced, would probably differ greatly from most of our states of consciousness.
This is why it is so difficult to determine what consciousness can look like in other animals.
If this, internally and subjectively, is neither measured nor, because of this particular Hardware, analyzed on the basis of our own experience, then its observation poses great problems to us.
Most of my developments refer to the content of conscious living, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more readily accessible scientifically.
Animal consciousness processes could be examined without taking into account their contents, and this is exactly what happened during studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially with the example of visualization.
But in this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, we focus more on the nervous correlations of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: both can be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also highlights the weight of the prefrontal cortex in the realization of visualization.
But what does it mean for the emotions?
I conclude that an emotional system such as the fear system is activated in a brain that is aware of its own activity.
What we call “fear” is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as the body’s reactions) captures living memory.
Thus observed, emotions are closely related to the regions of the cortex that characterize primates and especially humans.
Subtle degrees of feeling, associated with our voluminous nature, are released, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiate and categorize states to imput them to others than ourselves.
On the contrary, Antonio Damasio, for example, thinks that sensations from primitive activities are born in the areas of the body sensation of the cortex and brain trunk, as well as Jaak Pankseep who, however, focuses more on the brain trunk.
Since this network has not changed much over the course of human evolution, it could fully participate in transversal sensations of all kinds.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I cannot contradict it, but I believe it is indescribable.
Pankseep argues that what appears as fear in both men and rats is probably as felt as such in both cases: how could one check whether rats and men feel the same when they behave similarly?
A coward runs away from danger, but what if he feels afraid?
In my view, similar behaviors are not enough to prove identical experiences.
Of course, the nervous comparison helps: rats and humans have similar brain trunks, but cats don’t even have a brain.
But is the brain trunk the cause of the sensations?
And even if we could prove this to man, how could we prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have sensations.
But I wouldn't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are probably completely different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore the emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, progress is made on the nerve level as the same is measured in rats and in humans.
Since I don’t explore language and consciousness in rats, nor sensations, I don’t know if they exist.
It could be judged as short-term, but I prefer to move forward rather than constantly crawling against a wall.
I am a pragmatic emotional.
Platini, UEFA president: a time of grace for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik explained that the preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government considers the decision of UEFA in Bordeaux as evidence of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize, in collaboration with Poland, the European Championships," Wasjunik said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
Work has just begun, and there is still a lot to be done in both countries.”
In the schedule of the construction or destruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts run after the deadlines.
The number of stadiums for the European Championship could possibly be reduced from eight to six.
“We can no longer waste time.
We have to work at the maximum speed,” said Ukrainian League President Grigori Surkis.
"The Uefa keeps an eye on us all the time."
An even more radical measure has been decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish football league PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after many scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, an independent administrator.
The committee met at the request of Sports Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be “a real danger that the PZPN would not be able to act in the rules,” Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"We assured in a letter to the UEFA President that the preparations for the 2012 European Championship would not suffer."
Several Premier League members have already been convicted in the previous season for manipulation of mandatory relegation; in the end, the start of the League has even been declining to the last minute.
Dennis Quaid unworthy of counter-attack
She wanted to make a promotion for a new film, talked about her privacy in an interview — and now has trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan raised the veil on her former adulterer Dennis Quaid.
It foams - and counter-attack.
A Late War of the Roses for the former couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors engage in an unpleasant battle - at the sight and to the knowledge of everyone.
Last week, Meg Ryan spoke in an interview for the American newspaper InStyle about the causes of the marriage’s failure: “Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful.”
She would have known the extent of the deception only after the divorce.
The motif of this thought striptease lies in Ryan's press relations for his new film "The Women" - it tells the story of an adulterer.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to his qualification as an unfaithful husband was clear: it would be “Monstrueux,” he told the 54-year-old New York Daily News that “Meg once again retracts the history of our relationship and manipulates it.”
It would be more "repentant" than "the punishment and disturbances that involve a divorce for each child be revived in public" for their common 16-year-old son Jack.
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid has remarried and will soon become the father of twins.
This was his response to the claw blow: “In any case, my life continues.
I’m happy to have a wonderful family that’s all right.”
Prices of airline tickets and hotels are falling
In the first half of 2008, hotel flights and nights were less expensive than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would even be reduced by up to 50 percent.
Hotel flights and nights would have become advantageous again - this is the result of a study by the financial and travel provider American Express.
The company analyzed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and established, after a price increase in the first quarter, a sharp decrease in profits in the second quarter.
After hotel prices have increased over the years, hotel nights have already been reduced in many places.
From January to March, prices increased in 41 of the 48 European cities examined by an average of 6.9 per cent, compared to 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities examined.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than the previous year.
The trend was clear especially in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The causes of all of this resided for American Express in the low price of the dollar that led to a “decreasing travel enthusiasm for American tourists.”
Financial squares such as Frankfurt or London would also be more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotel prices keep up with a 26.3 percent increase, the record in Europe.
Also in terms of flight prices, the trend was up in the first quarter:
Due to the increase in the price of kerosene, passengers in the economy class have an average payout of 7.1 per cent higher than in 2007, long-haul flights, very fuel-consuming, have even increased to 29.2 per cent.
From April to June, the price of economy-class tickets fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, in business-class and first-class, however, price fluctuations were much less pronounced.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had increased by 11.9 percent, in the second quarter, they fell by 23.6 percent.
German domestic flights were even divided by two according to this study.
The reasons for this price drop would be, on the one hand, a slippery economic growth, the firm explains.
Demand would yield ground in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, there would be an increased pressure from competition by the "open sky" treaty that liberalizes air traffic between the United States and Europe.
Sign of the tense situation is the abolition by airlines of non-profitable routes, as well as the high number of airlines that had filed the balance sheet during the first half of 2008 - they were 24 airlines only in Europe.
HSV beat Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods, the SV Hamburg becomes the first in the ranking.
In the Borussia, Luhukay still failed to find an eleven functional.
Kristoffer Klein. Enlarge. Disaster landing for international player Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player only returned late in the game and his shot failed against the goal frame.
His message was precisely formulated, he had come out of his lips persuasively.
He just knew he was right.
"We need this second goal," said Hermann Rieger in the hallway of the vestibules of the Hamburg Arena.
There was not much going on in the locker room, the half-time was over, and most of them were racist in their place.
Rieger has been the HSV physiotherapist for nearly three decades, he enjoys a great reputation as well as many former protagonists.
And that is why his request was received in the strategic places.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol calmed down and raised the thumb to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of head coach of Hamburg Martin Jol.
So the orders seem to have been similar: and it jumps with this second goal!
Implementation was lacking.
"It wasn't all very nice to see today," confessed Marcel Jansen.
Bastian Reinhard would have “should have been more relaxed too.”
This 1:0 (1:0 in the middle time), the Hamburg team owes it to a headshot succeeded by Mladen Petric (at the 11th minute); and the fact that very weak players of Gladbach could not hurt the weak players of Hamburg.
"It was a dirty victory," summarized Marin Jol.
The SV Hamburg is celebrating its 121th anniversary this Monday.
Already Saturday afternoon, the fans celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the provisional rankings on the giant screen that indicated their club as the first of the class.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to take a step back," said Marcell Jansen.
It is doubtful that the interim result of the table reflects more the unpredictable character of the first league than the dominance of its HSV.
The team with its late arrivals - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petric as well as detached Jansen from FC Bayern - is certainly forming gently, but it still does not shine.
“We need more charm and more dribbles,” Jol demanded.
After the Failure of Voting
At Wall Street, fear is circulating.
The initial news of the failure of the rescue plan temporarily dropped the Dow Jones by 700 points.
This was the biggest loss of points in the space of one day in history.
Later, the Dow Jones got a little stuck.
Around 8:30 p.m., the world’s largest stock index was 10.579 points, with a decline of five percent.
The Nasdaq Technology Exchange Index was 1548 points with a drop of more than seven points.
The most losers of the Dow Jones were at that date American Express losing almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
None of the securities could return any more profits.
The shares of Bank Goldman Sachs accounted for a nearly 10 percent decline.
Just a few days ago, the great investor Warren Buffet had partnered with the company.
As part of the bailout plan, funds must be mobilized for the purchase of what is called spoiled mortgage securities.
However, the sum should not be paid at once, but gradually.
In return, the State should recover options on the shares of the financial company that can be exchanged in relation to the evolution of the price in order to reduce the burden on the Public Treasury.
Stock prices in Europe and the United States of America
The billions of aid for banks in Europe and the United States do not address investors’ concerns.
The stock price of the major German bank Hypo Real Estate collapses and pulls the Dax to the bottom.
The US Dow Jones index collapses despite the state’s planned financial market rescue.
A dramatic drop in the prices of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank led the German index (Dax) to a deep deficit.
The Bavarian real estate finance company's share has lost three-quarters of its value despite the federal government and private banks' rescue operation, Commerzbank accused a decline of more than 20 percent.
The Dax clearly slipped below the important psychological bar of 6,000 points and slipped to 5,839 points with a deficit of 3.7 percent.
Across the world, stock markets have fallen to their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the U.S. government’s <0x24>700 Billion Heavy Rescue Plan could not be enough to restart financial markets.
The Dow Jones at 10.809.25 points lost in the first opening hour 334 points or 3.3 percent.
The U.S. House of Representatives intended to vote on the bailout plan, the vote in the Senate is expected to follow on October 1.
The other European stock exchanges also knew only one direction: in London, the FTSE 100 index accused a drop of 3.2 per cent at the moment, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 per cent.
In Asia, the main Japanese Nikkei index fell to 11,743.61 points after a rise of 1.26 percent.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index dropped from 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the main Sensex index lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12.595.75 points.
In the MDAX, Arcandor’s shares fell after the announcement of a capital increase.
Private bank Sal. Oppenheim has subscribed to the 23 million new shares.
The commercial and tourism multinational has also announced that the shares will not be sold to Thomas Cook.
Dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has left researchers in perplexity: dark matter influences the speed of space probes while so-called gravitational support maneuvers.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not entirely correct.
For almost 18 years, the Ulysses space probe has been flying in space.
Because of soon frozen fuel lines, cryogenic death threatens it.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon is a cause of unfolding among researchers - the anomaly of gravitational support.
Gravitational support is a maneuvering of space probes, by which they obtain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example the Earth.
Thus, probes can save a lot of fuel.
The American-European Cassini-Huygens research probe used this physics trick, as did the Ulysses solar probe.
This is surprising to researchers for years: flying objects do not always behave 100 percent of the way they are expected to according to the venerable laws of gravity.
In addition, irregularities occur at the speed level.
The probes unexpectedly become faster or slower.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They christened him the anomaly of gravitational support.
Some experts feared that Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, which describes the force of attraction of matter due to the curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study still hard to believe that Einstein was not mistaken and tries to explain the anomaly of gravitational support using what is called black matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
“Black matter could be responsible for this anomaly, which is also close to Earth,” he writes.
Space researchers have only known the existence of black matter for about a decade.
It apparently emanates from it a force of attraction whose effect is observable on other celestial bodies.
It, on the other hand, is completely invisible, i.e. it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, particularly no visible light.
According to scientists' calculations, black matter would still represent a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists abducted in Egypt are free
After ten days at the hands of their kidnappers, tourists kidnapped in Egypt should be released, as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The Sudanese kidnappers had demanded a ransom of several million euros.
During the shooting prior to the release, six hostage takers were killed.
In southern Egypt, five Germans were abducted.
Negotiations for the ransom would already be undertaken.
The Germans are constantly in the kidnappers’ collimator.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are clearly free.
This is what Egyptian state television, the Arabic television channel Al-Arabija and the Italian media have jointly reported.
Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the bulletins of the Italian television channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been released.
We are checking their health,” Frattini said.
The five Germans, the five Italians and the Romanians, as well as their eight Egyptian escorts, are well and safe, Egyptian national television reported.
The 19 participants of the desert excursion are expected to be on their way to Cairo.
The circumstances surrounding a shooting prior to the release of the hostages remain vague: so the kidnappers would have been close to putting an end to the kidnapping, according to an Egyptian security officer, before the Sudanese army kills six of the kidnappers without screaming at the station.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom,” the agent said.
There was nothing left but to gather the hostages," when suddenly, "this surprise" occurred.
Sudanese soldiers shot down six of the kidnappers on Sunday in the border zone between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and arrested two of them.
The hostages had demanded from Germany a ransom of six million euros; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" stated that, according to a German mediator, the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the article, the kidnappers wanted to release the female hostages after paying the ransom.
The men had to be held until the kidnappers found a safe way to escape.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to comment on this story.
Abuse of a father-in-law who led to suicide
A court was informed that years of abuse by his father-in-law led a woman to commit suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, was imprisoned for six years after admitting eight chiefs of indictment for inappropriate conduct.
Truro’s court of law ruled that he regularly tied his granddaughter, Stéphanie Randle, during his childhood, from 5 to 7 years old.
Trerise wrote in a letter of confession: “I feel responsible for his death.”
The court was informed that Melle Randle, 34, committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007.
As a child when she lived in Coventry, Trerise had tied her up and banned her before forcing her to have sex while her mother was working in the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in the Cornwalls.
His granddaughter went to Plymouth.
But the court was informed that Melle Randle, a volunteer assistant at the National Trust, was haunted by abuses she had been inflicted twice a week.
Attorney General Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends had told Melle Randle, who was a good surfer and cyclist, since 2006 seemed "emotionally dead" and "had lost any hope for life."
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is believed that she committed suicide by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's beautiful father, who had written a confession letter ending in this way: "I tied her and bandaged her regularly."
“I didn’t sexually abuse her.
"I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You're really weird as a fetishist, your victim was certainly supposed to be terrorized, especially at the age of seven.
“This unpleasant saga ended with the victim’s suicide.
And what’s even more surprising is the fact that if she hadn’t done this gesture, her story would certainly never end in court.”
He added: “I emphasize in particular, as described by his father and mother, the effects of your crime committed over the years on Stephanie.
“Without them, she would probably be a happy, promising, and successful young woman today.”
Condemnation for loss of official data.
The Office Cabinet official who had forgotten top secret documents, in June on a train, will be convicted by the Official Secrets Act, the BBC said.
The man from the Department of Defense was on the move when he forgot two high-ranking documents on a train heading for Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
This is the least serious conviction of this act, without any indication of criminal intent.
BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said the episode had a lot of Whitehall people.
"They would have thought that this case would have stayed between the walls of the Department of Defense and the Office of the Cabinet," he said.
The employee who cannot be appointed is accused of violating Section 8.1 of the Act, i.e. the clause dealing with the safeguarding of information.
.The Crown Prosecution Service suggested that the ministerial officer be placed under the auspices of the Metropolitan Police, given the very sensitive nature of his work related to the Associated Secret Service Committee
The documents he lost contained assessments of al-Qaeda as well as the resources of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was then transported from his home to a secret place.
Building companies facing the B&B invoice.
British companies in the building may have to pay an invoice of more than <0xC2><0xA3>80 million to cover the rescue of the Bradford & Bingley bank.
The Government has provided <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion to protect the deposits of 2.6 million Bradford & Bingleys savers.
The interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that collect savings funds, including 59 companies in the building.
The CEO of the Building Societies Association (BSA), Adrian Coles, said it’s “irritating” to know that companies and their members will have to pay for broken pots.
The <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion loan will be repaid when Bradford & Bingleys mortgage is released.
But interest that will increase at the same time will be debited, every year, to the 700 financial companies that collect the deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 companies in the building are included in this list.
It's annoying to see that institutions that have been cautious now have to pay some of the bills of institutions that were far less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is stated that each company must pay a sum proportionate to the deposits it holds, and that intermediate companies must pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will rise to <0xC2><0xA3>450million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find <0xC2><0xA3>81 million to pay interest for the first year.
Adrian Coles, CEO of the building’s trade committee, told the BBC that the decision was unfair to him.
It is "irritating" to see that institutions that have behaved prudently during the recovery of the real estate market now have to pay for much less prudent institutions.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since 1945, the date of the first annals.
“We have to examine all aspects of this case over the coming weeks, to assess the options to be adopted to prevent building companies and their members from paying this salt bill,” Cole said.
Interests for 2009 cover seven months, from the end of September of this year until the end of March.
In 2010, interest will have to be paid for the whole year, which could also double.
Since building companies are non-stakeholder organizations, their members end up paying the bill either at higher charges, or at lower interest rates for savings accounts.
Milk increases up to five penny per liter
People in Jersey have to pay more for their milk
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will increase the wholesale price of its milk by five penny per liter starting Monday.
This is the second price increase that follows a two-penny increase in February, following a research conducted by a consulting company.
Retailers must decide whether they will in turn increase the price to consumers.
. Before the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk had been varied for the last time, in 2002.
A former Bangladeshi PM has been denied bail.
A court in Bangladesh rejected a bail application to former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who could be arrested on his return to the country.
His lawyers said the court refused to give him his bail over his trial for extorting a businessman, 50 million Taka (<0x24>729,000) when she was PM.
This case is one of the many allegations that have been made against him.
Khaleda Zia, Sheikh Hasina’s always rival, was bailed out earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh in a few weeks, but his party, the Awani League, has demanded that the country’s provisional military government give him first his full freedom.
Correspondents pointed out that the terms of her release were contradictory because if she was allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, they could not see why she could not remain free upon her return to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers have announced that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
“The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina’s request saying she does not require bail since she was allowed to go abroad for medical reasons,” said her lawyer Rafiq-ul Huq.
"We will appeal against the order of the Supreme Court"
Her lawyers argued that she needed this bail to return to the country to prepare for the elections in December
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return after October 17, a former Awami party leader said.
She was detained last year after the military interim government took power, but was released in June to take care abroad.
Sheikh Hasina as Zhaleda Zia, denies the allegations they make.
Concerns about the Afghan antipolio campaign.
In Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have missed the recent polio vaccination campaign, due to Taliban-related violence, the UN said.
The United Nations last week carried out a vaccination campaign in the six provinces.
But she said she failed to contact children from the dangerous areas of Helmand and Kandahar, located south.
A U.N. spokesman said this happened despite Taliban promises not to attack or obstruct thousands of nurses during vaccinations.
BSkyB loses ITV judiciary battle
BSkyB lost its trial following the Competition Commission ruling, which would force it to reduce its participation in its rival ITV broadcaster.
The Competition Court ordered BSkyB to reduce its ITV shares from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The Commission stated that, in the past, the participation of MSkyB had prevented competition and allowed it to unfairly influence ITV.
BSkyB bought its shares in 2006 following an agreement to actually prevent NTL, now known as Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Bureau reported that the acquisition by BSkyB of ITV shares raised doubts about the effective independence of ITV, prompting the Competition Commission to investigate
Virgin’s boss Richard Branson, a consumer group, and the Ofcom regulator were all opposed to this purchase.
BSkyB commented that forcing it to reduce its ITV shares would be unreasonable and on the contrary excessive – especially since BSkyB has just waived its voting rights.
New investigation into the U.S. prosecutor's case.
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to verify the question of the dismissal of nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
The whole was born from the report of the case of the Inspector General of the Department of Justice, who criticized the actions of some ministerial officers.
The report was critical of White House officers, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the thesis of lawyers who argue that their dismissal is due to political causes.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate to see if the officers questioned during the investigation have lied to the investigators, thus obstructing justice.
"Severe accusations of potentially criminal conduct, unfounded, have not been fully confirmed or resolved," Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The appointment of a special prosecutor capable of forcing witnesses to file was one of his greatest recommendations.
The dispute began with the radiation in December 2006 of nine U.S. prosecutors filed by the U.S. Department of Justice.
At the time, the Department had stated that prosecutors were fired due to poor benefits.
But then it emerged that the fired prosecutors were not more critical than their other colleagues, which prompted some observers to give these fires a political connotation.
Some of the prosecutors have been accused of being close to Congressional Republicans, while others have refused to investigate allegations of fraudulent voting against Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors are investigating and prosecuting the courts for the government.
It is certain that they can be fired at any time, but they cannot be fired for political reasons.
The head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, ended up accused of being involved in this dismissal case, and eventually resigned.
A number of ministerial officers in the Department of Justice also resigned.
The Inspector General's report was very critical of Mr. Gonzales' role in this case, declaring that he considered him "first responsible" for these dismissals, and ended up "abdicating" his leadership role," notably succeeding in not being involved in this case.
Other ministerial officers, including former Bush collaborator Karl Rove, were criticized for failing to cooperate during the investigation.
The Epic of Meat Loaf will be honored.
Rock star Meat Loaf, is due to be honored at the Q Awards for her epic song Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive an Oscar at the ceremony in London next week, said he was "honored" to receive this recognition.
The song of nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the hit of the 1977 Meat Loaf album.
The awards evening is presented by Coldplay, with this year’s selection limited to four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: “There are songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is definitely going away.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a big voice like Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental section that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released in the UK as a single in 1979, ranked 15th.
In addition, his album Bat Out of Hell remained in English rankings for nine years, and was sold to more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf- or Marvin Lee Aday, his real name, has suffered from health problems in recent years, even undergoing surgery to heal his heartbeat becoming irregular, after it collapsed on stage, in 2003.
In 2007, a strong laryngitis forced her to cancel concerts.
Then a cyst was found in the vocal cords.
A Dark Street in the City, Often Forgotten, and May Be Soon For Sale.
New York has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets and other parallel roads, some famous, others only functional.
And even some veteran taxi drivers as well as long-time local residents don't know how to get to Extra Place, because they've never heard of it.
The street is located in the East Village and runs north of First Street- not to be confused with Second Street- between Bowery and Second Avenue.
Approximately 30 feet wide by 120 feet long, it resembles a dusty avenue rather than an active artery.
. No signs indicate the street.
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
This street, however, has fans.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the builder of the recent luxury buildings on First Street.
He would like to renovate Extra Place, and create a more fluid transition to shops and stores, which should open in new buildings.
Other admirers, including long-time neighbors, said they were charmed by this shortcut simply because it remains one of the last and oldest streets of the pasta of houses.
But the Department of Preservation and Real Estate Development of the city that manages the street, has no interest in keeping it.
This month, at a meeting of the neighborhood owners’ committees, representatives of city agency and Avalon Bay drafted a proposal authorizing the real estate developer to buy the street.
But the committee prefers the street to remain in the hands of the city, and asked for a new proposal to be submitted next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of the Committee No. 3.
“There are few spaces left in the city, and we would like the city to retain Extra Place,” she said.
“They could propose to put it back in place and manage it, which Avalon might do, but we want to keep it public.”
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that it wanted to renovate the small street and install seats there, some of which would be used by a coffee shop to which the manufacturer would grant space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public at this month’s meeting.
Michele de Milly, spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that while the company wants to exploit the street, it doesn’t necessarily mean that it wants to be its owner.
"Avalon Bay's main interest is to relocate this abandoned alley, and make it public," she said, pointing out that it was the city that suggested the sale."
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Preservation of Real Estate, confirmed that the city wanted to sell the street well, stressing that the agency’s mission was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a slight historical footprint.
Some believe that Extra Place bears this name since 1802, when the legacy of Philip Minthorne's large farm of many children was divided, leaving aside this small piece of land, which has since been abandoned.
The CBGB's rear entrance, a punk rock monument closed in 2006, opened at Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the cover photo of Ramones' album Rocket to Russia.
"This place was beautiful," said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
It was full of irons, hailstones, barricades, posters, leaves and strings."
Some residents, including bloggers who had already talked about the evolution to the luxury of the East Village, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this humble little property should remain public.
Others have proclaimed Extra Place as a true rarity—a fragment virtually identical to the city that should be laid in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled "The Book of Contests: A Deeply Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Extinction") tells the story of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The New Yorker.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a small, narrow, dark day as night, and delimited by the doors of a rusted iron warehouse and Persians, full of last week's newspapers flying along the droplets."
With few exceptions nearby, the street always has the same charm.
A rat runs smoothly at the bottom of the street, near a door that once led to the CBGB, and which has now become the seat of a chic clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls, a 22-ounce empty beer bottle, rests next to newspapers that have just been thrown away.
Some passers-by have stated that they rarely think of Extra Place, and suggested its highlighting.
Field, for his part, said he thought that some underestimated the attraction of the street in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "are taking place in dark, wet and disgusting places."
The Bilingual Debate: Immersion in the English Language
In this part of the Education Supervision program, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidates’ position on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a former member of California’s studies, and former director of the education department at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book “not as Good as You Think. Why middle classes should be able to choose their school.”
Attracting Hispanic voters’ favors is a complicated business.
Barack Obama’s proposals on education are an interesting example of this.
Obama’s campaign stresses that “Afro-American and Latino students are less likely to graduate than white students.”
To combat these differences, Mr. Obama's education program supports particularly among so many other topics, "transitional bilingual education" for those who learn English.
However, the question for Obama is whether his desire to pursue a bilingual education that defends classroom instruction in languages other than English goes beyond his interest in eliminating differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles county.
The students of this school are largely Hispanic, and low-income.
More than a third of the students, consisting of many new arrivals, study English.
Among CM1 students, 100% passed the 2008 State Maths Exam, expert level.
Similarly, almost 93% of students have passed the English-language arts exam
This incredible success was achieved thanks to a different ingredient than that advanced by Mr. Obama.
Sixth Street puts on analysis, practice, constant assessment of capacities as well as exemplary attitude.
In addition, and here’s an example that Mr. Obama could copy, reports Linda Mikels, head of Sixth Street, this school has instituted the instruction of the English language “full immersion.”
The total immersion in the English language focuses on the almost constant use of English in the instruction.
Mlle Mikels, contrary to bilingual education, told me "we had a huge success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months later, if you went without her class, you wouldn't have had a chance to identify her."
"It works," she observes, "it worked for us"
Mr. Obama should not take the Sixth Street Prep as an example and replicate it in other schools composed mostly of Hispanic students learning English.
The excellent results obtained by this school speak of themselves; but the policies on education within its party (the Associations for National Education have long supported bilingual education) and its enormous support for bilingual education, the Mcuris response.
Although he is in favour of the fact that immigrants learn English, Mr. Obama recently considered this issue insignificant, when he proclaimed that we should all stop controversy over the wording of English-language laws.
"On the contrary," he stated, "you have to make sure that your child speaks Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to eliminate the differences, then he should carefully consider the models of education that work, rather than delineate them or consider them insignificant.
Net Oil Fall Following New Concerns of the World Economy
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday, as people fear that the rescue plan in favor of financial moves will not bring the economy back to life.
The final crude oil operations, fell by 7 percent to <0x24>99.80 a barrel. The New York Mercantile Stock Exchange, at sales this morning.
Prices have fallen by more than <0x24>20 a barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by Wall Street’s financial turmoil, as well as by two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After experiencing an increase of <0x24>145.29 per barrel in July, prices fell to almost <0x24>90 per barrel this month, before rebounding again in the face of deep uncertainty in the financial markets.
This Monday, investors are again concerned despite the deal on the rescue plan, the largest in history, concluded this weekend by Congress leaders.
The news has been mitigated by recent concerns that the crisis would be lasting.
In the very last episode of this financial disaster," Citygroup will purchase the banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation, the government said on Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments nationalized the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said that this weekend’s frivolous negotiations, concluded with the rescue deal, “seem to have failed to revive the market.”
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to slow.
"The prospect of global equity, interest rates and market exchange has become uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a letter to their investors.
"We think that raw materials will not be able to escape this contagion.
“As far as raw materials are concerned, our most pressing concern is to understand how far the American virus would spread globally and especially in China.”
The bank’s analysts lowered their expectations for next year, given the drops in oil consumption due to slowing economic growth, and were therefore forced to drop by 20 percent, the forecasts for oil and gas prices for 2009.
The Day of the Second Decisive Time for Team Record Improvement.
After spending the last eight seasons, more time than anyone in the Shaun Ellis Jets uniform, the defender thought he had seen everything.
He watched the second time, when the Jets turned a 0 to 0 into an explosion.
"I've never seen anything like that," Ellis said.
The second time began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals played salty under dark clouds.
Then quarterback Brett Favre made a pass to Laveranues Coles allowing a touchdown of 12 yards, a precursor sign of one after noon during which their relationship made a bond ahead.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns, the first when a corner back fell and the second, 10 seconds from the half-time.
"I'm not out of my zone" Favre said about all his passes to Coles.
"He's a poor player"
"We communicate extremely well, despite what people think."
While Favre and Coles played catch, the defense beat Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, corner back, intercepted a lost shot and made 32 yards to the touchdown.
Eric Smith took another pass and intercepted her.
Linebacker, David Bowens let the ball escape because of Warner.
At the last change, the loss of the Bowens ball, might well be the most charming event
The Cardinals took control of this possession for the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets regained the ball, Jay Feely made a 20-yard goal taking an advantage of 34 to 0.
It was the best the Jets could score in a while.
“Jets coach Eric Mangini, who was asked to describe this madness, said the second time or the third?”
When the two Jets were told to pass 21 undisputed points in the third time, Mangini said, "I can tell you that I enjoyed the second time more than the third.
." A lot of points have been marked in a short time."
Gebrselassie rested, exceeding his world record.
Haile Gebrselassie, Ethiopia, has once again proved worthy of his title as the best runner of the century, after breaking his own world record at the Berlin marathon on Sunday, becoming the first to race 26.2 miles in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a win at 2:03:59 from an accommodating race on the plate, Gebrselassie beat his record of 2:04:26 in 27 seconds, scoring last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie won the 26th world record of his superb career during which he won the world championship or the world record for any distance, from the 1600m marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed Beijing’s Olympic marathon, fearing—maybe exaggerated in today’s eyes—that air pollution does not increase its asthma problems.
On the contrary, he promised to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions- sunny weather, 48 degrees from the start, 55 at the arrival- Gebrselassie won Sunday, now an impressive average of a thousand in 4 minutes 43 seconds
Track runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyans, converted into runners-up, have contributed to the downturn of the marathon record by more than two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin at 2:06:05 .
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that he had suffered from cramps two weeks earlier, and had missed training for a week.
It is obvious that the rest allowed him to remain bright, but not rusty.
"I'm so happy," he told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I went back to it last week, and today I had doubts; but in the end, everything went for the better."
He was blamed--especially in Kenya, the rival is African of Ethiopia--to have too orchestrated his races, avoiding the world stars of the marathon, actually counting on the lads as if they were in a track competition, and considering the world records more than the sense of the world.
But this criticism does not diminish the size of Gebrselassie’s abilities as a background runner.
Sunday Gebrselassie, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the headlines disappeared.
A little more than three miles away, Gebrselassie made his final ascent to break away from Kwambai, who finished second at 2:05:36, improving his best personal record of five minutes.
Kamathis came third at 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now a German citizen, finished a remarkable year getting the seventh time of 2:19:19.
The Englishman Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprised everyone who won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She was unable to participate in the Beijing Games because of a hypothetical back injury, but promised to win in Berlin, improving her third marathon, her personal record of almost five minutes.
She ran using a skilled strategy, leaving the group of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners to take advantage, then surpassing them about 18 miles 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 later.
Askale Tafa Margasa from Ethiopia came second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop, Kenya, finished third in 2:25:01.
In a City in Part, the Pride and the Trials of Black Life
Hidden in the development of its immense park, a few miles from the sunny, bright and giant Orlando, lies a quiet small town where pride and complications of the African-American experience are born.
"Eatonville, the first entirely black city to integrate, Zora Neale Hurston's childhood home, this description she made in 1935, is no longer so simple to make these days." The city at five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 dark skins, 300 good swimmers taken, and full of squirrels.
It has now become a city of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the Zora Festival in Eatonville every year to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And in various ways, the city it describes has become a tourist thanks to its inclusion in the Florida tourist guide published by The Depression-era Federal Writers' Project- remains a separate place.
She is as independent, dignified, and private as she was in the 1930s, when Hurston told us that the black rural population of Florida was often reluctant to share her true thoughts with the white man, who "knowing so little, does not know what he loses."
Even though this is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has also called for an open dialogue on the topic of race, many here remain cautious from the gaze of the outside world.
"We are very cautious about how to tell the story," said Hortense Jones, 59, who has always been a resident and the oldest parishioner in the city.
"It must be in conformity with reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It represents both a historical model of the black takeover as well as a community of nearly 2,400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
This is a central point, but also an example of southern black rural culture—sometimes disdained, others acclaimed— which reminds us of the birth of American slavery.
That would explain why residents are both proud and protective.
The interest in the image of Eatonville was born with Zora, whom everyone here calls Hurston.
She presented her hometown to the world through sincere, dialect-filled books, such as Mules and Men (1935) and Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937).
Five paragraphs in Florida's guide transformed this city, located just outside Route 17, a road that crosses the center of Florida, often forgotten, which leads to chapters of black history and human drama.
Audacious such a big cashier in life as in literature, Hurston led the readers to the store owned by the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, who was then divided into several private parts.
“You’ll find the modern brown and white public school, with its well-preserved gardens and playgrounds that Howard Miller has always taken care of, though he barely knows how to read and write.
She also mentioned Widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn" sells drinks of all kinds as well as anything that can serve passers-by.
So, in barely a hundred words, Hurston associates Eatonville with a self-government but also with illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
Of course, Fodor wasn’t like that.
It wasn’t a portrait that everyone liked.
Zora described the reality well," said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of Johnson's young girls who Hurston immortalized, citing the colorless songs performed by men who praised their beauty.
She added: “Some people didn’t like it.”
Hurston is always remembered as a lively and eccentric person, who returned frequently after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that Hurston usually came to town without warning, aboard a large Chevrolet, a cigarette in his mouth and wore pants here, where even today, we are proud of traditional clothes.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many laughed at her.
"People were always happy to see Zora," he said.
But he also adds, swinging in his backyard chair overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly baptized, that "she never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten it.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in a grave in any part of Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived.
In Eatonville, no great commemoration, no plaque for the general public.
I don’t think they understood the contribution or legacy she offered to the world,” said Valérie Boyd, author of “Wrapped in Rainbows,” a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
A crucial moment occurred in the 1980s.
Public officials from Orange County wanted to make a five-way highway in town, to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the community’s two-way main street.
Orlando’s development has already pushed Interstate 4 to the western corner of the city.
The proposal was made as Eatonville recovered from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among many other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the dispute over the mix of races led hatred to the doors of the community.
“At that time, a gang of white youths were coming to launch oranges or objects against people sitting on the side,” Franklin said.
"A lady is even dead."
They threw a pasta out of their car.”
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's request for forced integration, defining his decision in Brown v. Board of Education "insulting rather than glorious of my race".
Residents now proclaim that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, although positive in some respects, has diluted Eatonville's cohesion and weakened youth confidence.
"The black children used to be kissed--I remember well--they kissed our master in the morning, and also in the evening," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins as well as chief executive of the Eatonville Community, a non-profit group.
This lasted, she added, until the teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
“You don’t kiss your white teacher because he’s white—I mean there’s a cultural demarcation line here,” said Melle Nathiri.
Civil rights, on the other hand, have created space for many other Zora Neale Hurston- black writers, actors and artists who have gone beyond the harm, as she, armed with a joyful self-confidence and lines of conduct such as: "How can they pray for my compassion?"
It surpasses me."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to the anonymous tomb of Houston and began to struggle to revive her reputation.
Five years later, a highly acclaimed biography of Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway, a real bestseller, reintroduced it to American cannons.
The highway project arrived just at the time when Eatonville’s most famous girl had regained her appeal.
And this time, Hurston’s old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The community began organizing a Hurston festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences of this highway.
Hundreds of fans came to the opening of the festival two years later, and many come back in January to commemorate it.
After many years, the county rejected the proposal for the highway.
"The fiasco of the five-way highway, extremely fast, is a real civic pride," said Melle. Nathiri.
Melle Boyd summed up the whole statement that "Zora saved Eatonville".
The victory against the highway project allowed him to change his own image.
Non-residents, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been attending our church since 1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents began to reconsider the past.
Eatonville has been a historic city since 1998.
A single theme library (obviously renamed Hurston) will open in 2006, on a magnificent Kennedy Boulevard, rebuilt.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: six miles from Orlando, it can at any time be considered a back street on a summer rainy day, as small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90 percent of the population is black.)
Foreigners who come to discover the history of Eatonville, its reason for being, are still treated with caution.
You have to ask permission for most interviews, and some things – like the walls of the old Eatonville church, painted by the white man, illustrating black men in the fields – should not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Melle Jones, a brave teacher who has a weak for the bright red, are still afraid that their island community will be well understood.
However, given the expansion of the Hurston Festival, a certain level of local pride emerged.
Young people in particular, tend to consider Eatonville as Hurston considered his entire race: beautiful, problematic and everything, neither better nor worse, but also proud, creative, bossy, crazy and mixed than other ethnic and racial groups in America.
It is a sincere civic affection that is heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin’s nephew Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or for the police forces, who need additional strength.
And even for the younger ones, such as 11-year-old Alondra and Alexia Kenon, twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned the Eatonville description correctly.
“Most people who pass through this area will think, ‘Oh, this city has nothing compared to others,’” Alondra Kenon said after Mass last Sunday.
But if you stop and take the time to look at history, it’s a very beautiful city.”
Here in New York, everyone talks about finance.
In spite of everything, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from the kiosk and giant TV screens at Times Square, they wouldn’t realize they’re in the eye of the cyclone.
Never could they think that in the glass and bee nest offices above their heads, bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York spend the worst "working day at the office" since the crack of 1929.
Deliveries continue to crawl on the sidewalks, with their carts and muffins plates for morning meetings.
Latinos always pull between residential buildings carrying, like mules, about fifty luxurious shirts hung on a yoke placed on his shoulders.
Office employees continue to make the queue to buy their morning sandwich from street vendors, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. every week.
I had not felt the crisis despite the completely pessimistic stories until this afternoon when I decided to open a new savings account.
Fortunately, I had planned to work in the late afternoon, as I would find out at my local JP Morgan Chase branch, about twenty people making the tail.
Not in front of the cashier’s stores, or to withdraw cash or make a payment, but in front of the customer service store, where regular customers ordered their cheques, tourists asked for direction for the Macy store, and new customers opened accounts.
Most of those in front of me, I would later learn from Starr, my "authorized personal banker", were all tailing for the same reason as me.
Not in the same way, because they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, such as those in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They have withdrawn their money from savings accounts called thrifts (such as a building company), credit associations, and the type of local savings boxes and their subsidiaries that only operate in a state, and that say treat customers as their family.
In a recent past, 15 of these banks went bankrupt.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with a capital of <0x24>327, has used the bankruptcy syndicate, and while New Yorkers were coming home for the weekend this Friday evening, another bank, Wachovia, was desperately looking for a <0x24>440 million savings account to buy it.
The office and the store employees in front of me, frightened by another potential downturn, transferred their money to a bank that seems to be the most reliable, the one that does the most rescue on Wall Street.
Some New Yorkers have become very familiar with the world of finance in recent weeks.
“I heard a lady at my local Chinese supermarket, talking on the phone of Lehman Brothers, the bank that went bankrupt, and her lean CEO Dick Fuld, with the same familiarity she might have had to criticize a colleague.
And Lyn, the uniform concierge in my building, changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or deliveries from my fruit and vegetable dealer.
She told me, following my visit to the bank. "I put all my savings in the monetary fund market.
“I’ve changed, I don’t want to take risks.”
Muslim tombs are profaned as Austria oscillates to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who abandoned the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party and , Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration to present the organization of the "cities against Islamization" in Antwerp, January 17, 2008.
They carry road signs illustrating red-rayed mosques.
Police accuse far-right extremists of defaming an Austrian Muslim cemetery on the weekend of the victory of the far-right political parties in the country’s general election.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at the Traun Cemetery near Linz, between Friday night and this morning; this is according to police, an organized action.
The criminals have painted on several tombs, Jewish symbols such as the Star of David; however, detectives think that this could have been done to disguise extremists’ feelings of hatred towards Muslim immigrants.
This accident could be in some way related to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic Community said it was “deeply shocked” by the announcement of this profanation, which occurs just during the religious month of Ramadan that touches to its end.
Austria is seriously considering recovering its courage following its right-wing oscillation in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, led an anti-immigration campaign, some of which were even considered xenophobic by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party, who won more than 18 percent of the vote, ran his campaign against wearing the skirt and the burkas, and even expressed opposition to the Alaha food.
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of a “European Brotherhood” to avoid the rise of Islam.
Both parties are trying to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, claiming that they would constitute a political symbol of the Islamization of Austria and Europe.
The polls and analyses carried out just after the elections have defined the far right as the country’s strongest political bloc, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who have made a difference because they are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter has been banned from travelling abroad.
The courts have banned the rock star glamour, Gary Glitter, accused of sexual abuse of children, expatriation to France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter, after he expressed to the authorities that controlled it, his intention to travel to Spain through France.
Police in Kent granted the travel ban last Thursday after proving Glitter’s guilt for child sexual abuse to the judges.
Glitter, or his real name, Paul Gadd, was not present at the hearing in Ashford’s limited jurisdiction courts, but was still represented by his lawyer Corker Binning.
A court spokesman said " Thursday, September 25, at Ashford court, Kent police requested an application to prevent Paul Gadd from travelling to France and Spain until March 25.
"Paul Gadd was not present at the time."
Glitter, 64, informed the authorities that he wanted to go abroad, leaving to be listed on the list of accused of sexual abuse.
He must mandatoryly inform the authorities if he wishes to go abroad for more than three days.
He must also inform the police, 7 days before his scheduled departure date.
If he does not communicate his movements to the authorities, he could purge a sentence of up to five years of imprisonment.
Kent police said they would not discuss any particular cases or potential Glitter displacement in the county.
A Kent Police spokesman said: "The Kent Police will do everything necessary to protect our children as foreigners.
"In our view, it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the UK because we have devices capable of managing any potential risks, in a much more efficient way.
“Protection of the residents of Kent is the most expensive intention for the Kent Police, and we are closely monitoring the behavior of those accused of sexual abuse in the region, in order to minimize potential risks to the public.”
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after purging 27 months in a Vietnam prison for abusing two girls, 10 and 11 years old, respectively.
When he was released, Glitter took the plane to Bangkok from where he would have boarded for a flight to London.
But he said he didn’t feel well, and refused to leave for London.
The Thai authorities blocked him from controlling his passports, and eventually he left for Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities denied him entry into their territory, and he was therefore forced to leave Bangkok; the Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Terminal 3 of Heathrow Airport on August 22 and stayed there while his lawyer, David Corker, went to the Uxbridge Court of Limited Jurisdiction, West London, for the record of persons charged with sexual abuse, such as Scotland Yard's claim.
In the past, Glitter had already been sentenced to four months in the UK for detention of images of child abuse.
A Interior Ministry source said Jacqui Smith, the interior minister, was reassured and pleased to know that Glitter had been banned from travelling to France and Spain.
"I photograph the master outside the stage to capture elements of his character" Günther Bauer - Photographer
No heels, no stretching clothes.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, freed from all tensions to obtain the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, in these unknown moments of the general public, where you discover intimate gestures and stolen glances of artists who do not care to get on stage.
German Günther Bauer in "Flamenco - people" blends the theatricality of a few stages with singers, dancers and guitarists with this less known side of artists.
In this project, the photographer takes the particular iconography of flamenco from different angles.
Included in the Flamenco Photography Month programme, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, greater every day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco - people" "can be anyone but, after seeing the photos, the observer realizes that these are not typical images.
These people photographed "in the street" are artists capable of conveying on stage passion, sadness, joy... by captivating the audience.
To capture moments of personality of these artists you do not need to take pictures on stage.
They have a personality and a clean character.
What I was interested in was creating an intimate atmosphere that allows me to capture with the camera moments of personality of the flamenco stars."
With the festival "Popular Song of Mines", Bauer embarked on a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a record camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of the camera and the equipment, remember classical photography.
The implementation of different stylistic means breaks with the classical side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of flamenco according to Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and that surprises every day".
It is not about dancing or singing in itself, but about the personality and character of the artist who captures the audience with his art.
The search for the essence and magic has been the constant of this work that we present these days at the gallery El Fotómata.
Flamenco stars such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from about seventy photographed artists.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a collection book of portraits exhibited at the gallery.
The passion for Bauer's portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "Portraits of Old Sportsmen" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he loves photographing people's portraits, getting to know them and being able to enter their lives for a moment more or less.
I think in photography the portrait is the most difficult kind.
You find yourself in front of people, characters you sometimes don’t know or who just leave you a few minutes to be able to take a picture of them.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I’m always trying to make my ideas come true.”
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco, titled "Flamenco - people", is exhibited at the Galerie El Fotómata, located at the 20th of the Rue de la Mata (parallel to the Hercule people) which will be opened until October 16th.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "true daring"
The novel takes place in places no one knows and deals with unknown subjects, but once again, Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to advance the new project on which he is working, a novel that has as the main character Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who has lived for twenty years in the Congo and who is pazoa.
The Nobel Prize laureate confessed yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia, that the novel that currently occupies it "is a real audacity" and that "everything proves that he shouldn't write it".
"If I were reasonable, I wouldn't, but I'm going to do it and hopefully finish it," he concluded in his speech at the exchange of ideas and thoughts festival, which for four days saw a hundred people, writers, and historians roam the city of the aqueduct.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was the most anticipated character of the third edition of this festival and fulfilled his contract.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award by a majority of the votes of the participants, made room for the Juan Bravo theatre.
The presenter of the Festival, Félix Romeo, found himself face to face with a fascinated audience who did not see the time spent in which documentary in which Peru, with a wonderful memory and with a great dose of humour, has traced the birth of his new literary vocation; he has an experience, which is due to "his thirst for reading and living text."
The Hispano-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and to know if books change lives. "But I refuse to believe that literature is a pure amusement, an ephemeral experience," said Vargas Llosa, who said "not to go" and called "their people to be less of a kind" and said that it "has no effects."
Bad weather ruins the Pozoblanco fair
The flag party that concluded the bull races at the Pozoblanco Fair was suspended yesterday morning, after the horse toreators checked that the arena was unpracticable.
In this way, the organizing committee, in agreement with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonard Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the bull race.
The bad weather has hardened on this fair, as in the end two out of three parties could not take place.
Saturday was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second planned bull race.
On the poster, there were José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz y Juan Bautista, who should have fought in the arena of Castilblanco.
So only the Friday's party took place
On Friday, the winner was Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and was brought in triumph, after making arms moves in front of the bull with taste and aesthetics.
In the afternoon, Alejandro Talavante concluded on two banners planted on the back of the bull and a cut ear that the steps discovered applauded more than his struggle in himself with the bull.
Worse still for El Juli, who has entered the arenas of Los Llanos with no pain or glory.
During his fight with the second bull, after a much better fight, he was whispered by most of the audience.
Police check of a van in the province of Alava: two thousand kilograms of hachisch found
Five hours less than ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the police of Euskadi (Ertzaintza) at the border of the Municipality of Arminón (Alava).
Police arrest two occupants of a van and the latter two run away.
Its load, more than two tons of hachisch, from which to stop them.
The police were prosecuted and arrested by one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man identified as A. A. J., according to information released by the Basque Government Department of the Interior.
The detainee was charged with drug trafficking and falsification of documents.
The incident occurred when several officials of the Alava Traffic Unit were conducting a vehicle inspection on the N-1, at the border of the Municipality of Arminón.
They were preparing to stop a van to inspect it when the driver disobeyed the orders, suddenly accelerated and the control began.
Police began their prosecution until the vehicle stopped two kilometres further on the lower side, where the two occupants descended to flee into a wooded area.
Basque police finally arrested one of the two occupants and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hachisch they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear of the vehicle was loaded with hachisch ballots, and then they transferred it to a police station for a thorough inspection and to weigh the drug.
In addition, officials found that the registration plate had been "falsified" as it did not coincide with that written on the grey card of the van, which is also why they charged the detainee with a document counterfeiting offence.
The Ertzaintza continues its investigation to arrest the other suspect, who managed to escape and to determine the origin of the drug seized.
The detainee, A.A.J., 28, has been placed on custody to carry out the various procedures and will be tried in the hours that follow.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of a drug
Actress Heather Locklear, the famous Amanda from the TV series Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Bárbara, California, for driving under the influence of a drug.
A witness saw her do strange maneuvers while trying to get out of her garage in Montecito, according to a spokesman for the California police patrol told People magazine.
The witness said that around 4:30 p.m., Locklear “should have been deeply pushing the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the garage, and going back and forth several times, she was riding on her sunglasses.”
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who initially did not recognize the actress, saw Locklear stopping in the middle of the highway and exiting his vehicle.
This person, at the time, called the emergency services because "she was worried about Locklear's life".
When the police patrol arrived she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"She looked disoriented," that's why the agents drove her to the drug and alcohol center to conduct a test.
According to a police spokeswoman, the actress was cooperative and alcohol abuse was eliminated from the start, although "according to police officers at first sight, we thought Locklear was under the influence of a drug".
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of a substance that had not been specified and was imprisoned around 7 p.m. and released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left the Arizona clinic where she was incarcerated to treat a nervous depression.
Callazares asked the Andalusian Federation of the Left Union to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The general coordinator and deputy of the Left Union, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it is the regional federation to make a decision on the case of the former advisor to the Youth and Sports of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned family last week after being accused of treating members of his own.
"In those cases, I am very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its responsibilities," said Llamazares with regard to the behavior of the political party that he will have to adopt within the municipal council of Seville.
However, the leader of the Left Union demanded that investigations prove "transparency" for irregularities that Silva could have committed: "The Left Union has always defended this kind of business so that they have a maximum degree of transparency."
He also stressed that the political party has "very strict ethical codes for all officials".
"Blood of Mayo" by Garci
Inspired by the stories of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreated the famous battle of the Spanish against the French in "Blood of Mayo", which is the most ambitious film of his filmography with almost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 million in budget.
The filmmaker has tried to "play the many characters and illustrate social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of the long list.
The more than two-and-a-half-hour film, Blood of May, will be released in theaters next Friday, which will then become a TV series for Telemadrid for more than four hours.
A great admirer of Galdós’ literature, José Luis Garci assures that with this filming he has realized "a dream of a child" thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him, three years ago, to make a commemorative film for the two hundred years of the 2nd of May in Madrid, something that he always accepted when he made history.
The <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 million provided by the Municipality of Madrid constitutes a "unique opportunity" for Garci to reproduce with the appropriate decor and clothing the atmosphere of "a Spain that was mistaken for the fight, since the struggle for independence led the people to under-rebellion.
But the filmmaker regrets not getting funding for the films "Capitaine Alatriste" or "The Ghosts of Goya" - more than twice that obtained for "Blood of Mayo" - because he couldn't make a few scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he collaborated.
The filmmaker of "Return to Start" influenced his usual way of working, the setting of the actors, with whom he has the habit of repeating before he starts the filming and to whom he does not cast, since it seems "humiliating" and considers that "the role of the filmmaker to be informed and the filmmaker is to be the subject of the filmmaker.
Many actors in "Sangre de Mayo" repeat in front of the camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Four times Oscar-candidate (he won one), Garci considers that the three films that represent Spain this year at the Academy of Hollywood, "Blood of May" "," "Sept tables de billiards français" and finally the winner," would have said, "The blind suns are not a mere "representation of the squirrel, they are not a squirrel.
With this film Garci is not expected to have a price.
“At first you think you’re working for posterity, then you realize that you’re only working for prosperity, and now you’re just making another movie,” Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabelle Bayón gets into the skin of sevillan dancer Tórtola Valencia
A Sevillan dancer will pay tribute to a Sevillan dancer as well.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana neighborhood and will live in London with her family at the age of three.
She was a free dancer and a specialist in oriental dance.
She had an exciting life, pioneering the liberation of women, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated for the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked the history of dance in Europe between the two wars, fascinated Isabelle Bayón.
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she offered me to play Sevillan dancer Tórtola Valencia and it seemed incredible to me.”
According to the dancer, "we are not trying to tell her life but to translate her way of thinking.
The titles of his dances made me think of flamenco.
Thus, "The Dance of the Butterfly" made me think of a Cuban folk dance and "The Dance of the Serpent" to some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my way of dancing was the same as hers,” she says.
The performance was made thanks to two remarkable contributions: that of Miguel Poveda who will again sing Isabela in one of his shows, as he had done in "La puerta abierta"; and that of Professor Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to collaborate with the one who was his pupil.
"Matilde turns Tórtola into a mature character.
I am happy because she has agreed to play a role in my work and it honors me.”
The performance was also made thanks to the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres y Paco Arriaga, the popular song of Michel Ortega, el Pulga y Moi de Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the violin of Rafa El Viola, and the collaboration of actors such as Juanfra le Juárez.
This work also tells, in a way, the life of this woman who exhibited herself in such remote places, especially for the time, as in India, the United States, or Russia, but also throughout Europe, as she usually lived in London.
“I wanted to remember it because I think it’s these women who have a huge influence in their time and now no one knows and appreciates their work,” Bayón said.
The show starts at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega Theatre
The publication of the "Journal of a Recently Married Poet" concludes the Triennial
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Journal d'un Poet récemment marié" in the church Saint Stephen's in New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Norabia, so that the "Journal d'un Poet recently married" of the "Journal d'un Poet" and the "Journal de l'Andalouez" are included in the activities provided by the Ministry of the "Norabia".
In this way, the "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the reissue of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the itinerary exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: This people of light" which was inaugurated in New York, in different times of the last May and after having had the will.
Similarly, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia purchased eight hundred copies of the "Journal of a Recently Married Poet", published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to perpetuate the work of one of the best-known Andalusian poets.
America Likes Less Without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was part of it."
This phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Absent Evil," and well illustrates the despair of American cinema, and all of America, facing the striking idea that Newman is no longer of this world.
It was hard to get an Oscar.
He hasn’t been running since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
It was a hard blow for everyone.
“Sometimes what one feels is beyond all expression, and now I have lost a great friend,” said Robert Redford, “my life and my country were better because of his existence.”
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
One of the fathers of cinema and homeland died during a particularly obscure period, when terrorists and stock markets were frightened, Americans’ esteem fell far down, desperately seeking reasons for dignity.
When times are so hard and without reason to live, it is only for human beings to be admired and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He embodied for everyone an ideal of beauty and truth.
He was Richard Nixon's enemy and advocate of lost and defeated causes, as the foundation for the fight against drugs created in honor of his deceased elder after an overdose and the creation of his own organic food brand.
This was a victory for a country that had a hard time imposing itself against a suicidal food culture.
This expansive wave of admiration swept Hollywood without paying attention to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, found that no James Bond died before him.
Another Englishman, the oscarist Sam Mendes, said working with Newman marked the summit of his career.
The bad boy who arrived from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to name Newman as his greatest inspiration.
“He put the high bar on us,” said George Clooney, who is perhaps the only one today who tries to pierce the screen like Paul Newman did: being very honest and having a serious privacy and away from the targets.
It is still not easy or possible in today’s media jungle.
But there is one who tries, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was loyal even though he did not miss opportunities to not be.
"But why should I eat a hamburger outside of my house, if I have a bifteck in my fridge?" he used to joke.
In heaven, he proudly attends the meeting of his daughters with his fans on earth, something that is not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles he played, he has never been as proud as the devoted husband, the loving father, the caring grandfather and the philanthropist," he said.
Madrid in the race at the 2016 Olympics
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can organize the Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, it could happen in 2016.
But I wonder if we're ready.
If we take the example of yesterday’s race: we are not!
They call it the perfect race, but I think it was the worst race I’ve ever been in.
If they had taken into account all the errors that occurred during the race, they would be the subject of an eliminatory note.
But let’s look at it in detail and from the beginning.
Mistakes start with the removal of the dossards, which forces you to go ahead.
It’s not bad, but if they move you it would be better if they gave you everything (including the electronic chip for the races).
Well, no.
They made you go there just to take the backsard (first mistake, move just for that) and (after a long waiting row) surprise!, there was only size 'S ' for the shirt (second mistake, because I need a size XL)
In what world do we live?
Is it because of the crisis that they have decided to buy only small size shirts with less fabric and therefore less expensive?
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened on the day of the race.
Apart from the fact that you have to go there very early to remove the electronic chip, the waiting time is 15 minutes and, moreover, you have to leave your backpack at the entrance.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible given that 11,000 people are expected for these races.
Since there was a long line of wait, the competitions started and we had not yet left our backpack at the entrance, although once done, the withdrawal was worse.
In addition, the rain accompanied the wait of more than 40 minutes during which riots and raids took place at the barracks.
I think about 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me won’t even be in the classification with the exact time, because of the chip they gave me that I don’t think marked the start correctly.
Of course, if they asked me to cite a perfect race example, this would not come to my mind.
So I think we can always dream of becoming the host city for the 2016 Olympics.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT Emerging Technologies Conference, Microsoft presented a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of Artificial Intelligence with little intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks when talking, such as calling a taxi (or, in the case of, in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle service).
Thanks to a camera and a facial recognition system, this “receptionist” can know how many people there are in the place, who they are – including remembering what positions they occupy – and listen and hear the keywords of their conversations.
But also group them according to conversation groups
In the presentation video, the receptionist detects a third person but understands that she does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that she is not part of the company.
She asks her if she's here to visit someone and she tells her that she'll answer her in a few moments.
All of this without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But of course that represents the future.
Now the company has other things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we talked about a change of strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and it will no longer have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers were sold with the indispensable instead of unnecessary apps, they would go five times faster.
This is a discovery since Microsoft, version after version, has not stopped adding features and "extras" to Windows.
Change of strategy is welcome.
Microsoft is right, its operating system is losing importance, but also its software.
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those who adhered to the theory that Google Chrome is the first step on the part of Google to compete with Windows.
Many people rightly pointed out that an Internet browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary as it is the essential basis for computer hardware and software to understand each other.
It serves the same function as your wife or husband when you have to say something to your stepmother.
It's true.
It will never disappear, but the “death” of the operating system must be seen not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system but more and more to the Internet browser.
The computer is turned on only to run Firefox, Explorer or Chrome, and every day people spend more time browsing the Internet than browsing through windows.
To whom do half of the applications provided with the system serve?
Who can the most can the least.
And Windows 7 will have to contain fewer applications, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, messy, less complex.
At the moment, Microsoft is more interested in launching its own online services so that they finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need this, indeed, and I will show you an example.
The photo in this article was taken earlier this month in one of Microsoft’s employee-reserved restrooms in Redmond.
On the beverage distributor, a poster requests them to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, a study found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week a delay occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not be released in early 2009 but towards the end of 2009 or see in 2010.
Microsoft will probably try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 at the same time.
After all, the phone is more and more like a computer.
But since the launch of Android is late and the iPhone is already on the market, it will cost them expensive.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso was endorsing him on the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio was wearing one in Edward Zwick's " Blood Diamond", as was Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's "The Parent" and is part of the dress of the Muscled Gays Association.
And if we set out to list all its appearances, we could also cite this moustachu coastal that raised weights in a walking circus.
It’s not just a simple male body shirt made of cotton, moulded and sleeveless.
The English call it 'tank' but the Fabulous Marcel of Brussels stands out among all others.
First of all, by his flamboyant name - although it is known as 'Marcel' - which has to do with the sport since it takes the name, according to legend, of boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of singer Edith Piaf.
The ' Marcel ' is distinguished from others by its excellent cotton, its unisex cut, its distinctive logo and the small ( barely recognizable) Belgian flag that the most famous body shirts have in the neck.
But be careful, because the Belgian brand does not only produce tank tops.
But it also produces sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, babies, mini-shorts...
Clothes designed for the comfort of underwear.
Even though it is a shame to wear them only as underwear.
They have too much charm.
“I want to be a young mother; the candidate doesn’t bother me.”
His enormous resemblance to his sister did not prevent him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently, the Cruz sisters are taking their new fashion activity very seriously.
According to Monica, they are not just beautiful and famous girls who lend their name.
She was present at the promotion that the Mango brand made in Paris to its new headquarters but also at the presentation of the most important fashion awards sponsored by the Spanish house.
Monica is warm and shy.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that my sister Penélope and I have created for Mango for the new autumn-winter season, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the Mango Fashion Awards and the Dinner of the Opera in honor of Valentino.
A very intense but at the same time exciting day awaits us.
What is your new collection for Mango for this fourth season based on?
The cinema of the 1950s and 60s enchants us and we are very inspired by it for our collections.
I like to walk around town and watch women to see how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I do it often.
Dancing, acting and drawing, you’re a very versatile woman, aren’t you?
I think yes, but in the end everything comes together and these activities have a lot in common.
Since I was a little girl, I used to enjoy my clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother’s house to look in my aunt’s closet and see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, when I became a dancer, I was always trying to take care of my way of dressing.
Dancers like to dress very well for classes and tests, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of an actress, when you put on the clothes, that’s when you really put yourself in the character’s skin.
All of a sudden, everything is connected.
You had it not long ago 30 years ago: has it been hard for you?
Not at all.
I feel better than ever, my 30s are cheering me up.
I find that the woman is more mature, has more experience and tastes life with less problems.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I’ve done all the things I wanted to do since I was little and it gave me a lot of inner happiness.
So, you think you're gonna be a mom?
Of course, I want to be a mom because my body asks me for it and, moreover, I want to be a young mom; I don’t want to lose that.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I am not concerned.
What I will do is give a lot of happiness to my son and raise him with a lot of love.
Let’s go to the cinema, you’re waiting for the different movies you made last year to come out.
That's right, I'm looking forward to them coming out.
I'm a woman from the theater, I'm very impatient and worried, I'd like to have everything now but of course it's not possible.
I am looking forward to the release of the films 'The Last Hour' and 'In Search of the Tomb of Christ'.
Let's see what you think...
A few days ago you started on the gateway with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Don't say that!
I didn't go up the gate to be a model.
Simply put, Naomi Campbell called me, I've known her a long time ago, to invite me to participate in London at a charity parade for her association for women's support and the clothes we exhibit - I exhibited two clothes from our collection created for Mango - Naomi's money was sold back to stocks.
The people that Naomi is a tender hearted person.
They say so many things about her, I know her, many things are not true.
Besides, Naomi's good side fascinates me.
She asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if she had to ask me to make the scissors, I would have done it anyway.
The important thing is to make life better for women in the third world.
Alcohol-drivers will have to install the ‘alcolock’ system
The Minister of the Interior wants the driver who has had more than three administrative penalties for alcoholism to install a system in his vehicle that prevents the vehicle from starting intoxicated, or if he does not breathe.
The initiative was already announced in June last year and now appears in the State Minister's report in which this initiative is considered as a one-year pilot project.
Its goal is the reintegration of the driver by offering road rehabilitation courses.
The Minister of State in charge of road safety, but also the Directorate-General for Road Safety and the Institute of Technology for Automotive Safety Foundation will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of drivers arrested for driving more than once in a state of drunkenness, the car resumes.
Alcohollock would avoid this as it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in the haleine and prevents the vehicle from starting if the driver does not breathe ahead; or when the driver's alcohol level is higher than the permissible.
Its cost is more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,000 and is at the expense of the driver.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device reduced offences by up to 65% during the first year of installation.
And in Spain, it is estimated that this could save the lives of 115 people every year.
This measure applies only to administrative penalties for two reasons: dealing with such behaviors before they become criminal offences.
And to facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be done by ordinary means but, however, reform by criminal means requires an organic law reform.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although some industrial and functional vehicles already have an experimental one.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of MEPs will vote on an initiative of the Spanish Socialist Party which proposes to install this system in school buses as it has been done in France.
In Mexico without 'peep-toes'
At 5:40 p.m., the plane of the Spanish Air Force, in which the Princes of Asturias were flying, landed in the Presidential Hangar of the Benito Juárez Airport of Mexico DF.
The sun was on the eve of sunset, but its rays still forced him to put his hand as a visor so that he could see the royal couple descending from the plane.
At the foot of the staircase, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours earlier I had asked the taxi driver in the street if he knew that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to finish their official trip.
- Oh, well, we're not gonna be able to go to the airport to pick up customers at this time... are you from here or then...?
- No, no, sir, I'm Spanish, but I've lived here thinking for two years.
- Oh, very well...
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and knows the importance of the journey.
There are several waiting in the airport hangar near the red carpet and a military row consisting of 27 Marines.
The Prince is smiling and dressed in marine blue, and the Princess, when she has her hair in the wind, is very overly dressed and does not wear her usual 'peep-toes'; perhaps they had told her that a storm was threatening.
They make a brief stop with the photographers before passing into the room where the official courtroom awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they stay, one of the city’s four largest hotels, a rigolo journalist from Mexican television awaits them.
The most prestigious price of fashion
There is certainly no more suitable place in the world to present a fashion prize than Paris and there is certainly no more extraordinary living and good living cartoonist than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Butón-Mango Fashion Awards, in order to strengthen the international image of new fashion talents.
The winner will be rewarded with a prize of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300,000.
Yesterday, the Belgian winner of the first edition, Sandrina Fasoli, was looking at her models in Mango’s showcase at 54 Haussmann Boulevard in Paris and she was almost crying with emotion.
This is certainly the second largest store in Europe, which has just been inaugurated with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first store is in London.
The events, as well as the desire to thank the stylist Valentino, president of the jury of the competition, made us meet in a luxurious dinner at the Garnier Opera House in Paris.
With a table next to that of the extraordinary Chagals family, the presidential table prepared by Mango, seemed even more spectacular.
Having grown up on the heart and doing against bad fortune good heart, due to the recent death of her brother, Nati put on a mango dress and a few ELAH parures, which cut off the breath, and arms on top, arm down with her son Luis - a beautiful man from two feet tall with her hand.
Andik, the owner of Mango, a gallant man, and the Baron of Rotchil ended the evening without a coat because they had lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who came to the store with a pants and a shirt – from her own collection – and who for dinner metamorphosed herself wearing a long sexy and black dress, was shocked when during the night tour of the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, she had a great balloon, she had a good time, and she showed us her red dress.
Inés Sastre did not stay for the visit of the palace dependencies, but she showed us before on her cell phone photos of her son.
The next morning we had the pleasure of seeing Olivier Martínez – another beautiful man traveling by motorcycle – and John Travolta, who arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, with his linens, his towels and having asked in advance that there were no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh there, that's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are not only 1000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and frenzy of everyday life.
And to crown it all, they are all listed in a book that will bring relaxation to librarians on September 30.
The wake-up call almost saddens us when it rings every morning at 7 a.m., but it’s even worse when we think about the agitated pace that current life imposes on us.
The office is synonymous with tension and the computer with back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there is neither one nor two methods to combat daily fatigue and problems related to the world of work.
But 1001, not one more or one less.
Apart from yoga positions, classic massages or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together in the pages of a book a whole menu of methods adapted to everyone’s taste and time.
The anti-stress work is entitled "1001 Ways to Relax" and will arrive at the bookstores directly from publishers Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to get peace of mind in places like work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' denies such a belief.
In addition, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that help you relax.
If adrenaline does not run into your veins to restore your body’s balance and if stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, disconnect your mind and focus on reading.
Talking and Sleeping
Some children talk during the night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very awake by telling us something that happened the day before, but to the children who speak during their sleep.
The first time it happens it may surprise you, but in reality it doesn’t matter.
It is a benign alteration of sleep that is called somnolence.
This is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure there's more than one who talks during the night.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (once in life, for example, associated with an episode of severe fever), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month...), the day after the child remembers nothing.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance.
They are often associated with other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night terrors, night drowsiness (picking in bed) or sleep apnea, but this is not always the case.
As we have already said before, they can also be associated with very strong fevers, stress or overexcitation situations.
Either way, it is a phenomenon that has not been studied.
The intensity with which it occurs is also very variable.
It may be that he speaks with a quiet little voice, with isolated words, murmurs or on the contrary with screams, tears, long speeches...
In the case of somnolence becoming very common, it would be wise to observe the child and consult a specialist, to check if there is a problem that causes a lot of anxiety and in order to get an explanation for this problem.
We said it is a benign alteration, which is why there is no treatment, unless it is related to another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it is related to sleep apnea or stress).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child before going to bed.
Therefore, look for quiet games and avoid programs or TV series that are more or less violent.
With children who are very nervous and hard to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm down internally.
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
As soon as the dreams appear, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will no longer remember what happened.
Useful Tips
Don't wake him up.
It's useless because he's unconscious and you'll wake him up.
Even if he talks, he sleeps and rests.
Remember that if he is very anxious several times, it is advisable to consult a doctor or check what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not usual), don’t be tempted to question him for information.
You won't get anything, because sleeping, he's not conscious to be able to organize his thought.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you will not know what he is dreaming about, so pay attention to how you interpret the information and the conclusions you draw.
Never tell the child that you can question him during the night to know his secrets.
Not even jokingly.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion, don’t worry, it’s not a good thing, it’s an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Isle of Man... Finally
Illhaeusern finally found the path to victory on his field after a long period of dissatisfaction.
Without making a big match, the Yellows and Blacks have created the greatest number of occasions and have managed to transform one for the win of the match.
The rhythm was not very sustained during this meeting where the attackers had difficulty in expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by the visitor captain Kauffmann who was rolling the sparkle on a shot from a distance, Illhaeusern was going to take the ascent slightly and turn Fonderflick from a distance, then with Hirn above, Roman from the end of the foot or even Diebold came to chase the defense of Danne.
In front, we were blocking in the middle of the field and we were just leaving the Riahi Removal at the top of the attack.
The beginning of the second half would be decisive with first two times signed Riahi and Temporal for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illhousians by Marais, well positioned to resume a ball postponed on a first attempt by Diebold (53rd').
But the Illhousians will not be able to taste his happiness for a long time and will be forced to return to the wardrobes a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates in digital inferiority.
But Dannemarie won’t be able to take advantage of it and won’t be a big problem for an Eleven Illhousian who just got a little backwards to “compact” his defense, except in the last few seconds of the game where, after a big knockout, the ball passed very close to the crossing.
Sarkozy to meet with angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a tour of Britain.
Faced with the demonstration of strength of fishermen who severely disrupted access to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the President of the Republic decided to visit the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère, on Tuesday morning, to meet their representatives there.
The latter promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hope that he would "come with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that falls at the same time as a general assembly of the "crisis committee" set up by the Breton fishermen to get measures against the flight of gasoline prices, which has reached an average record of more than 1.14 euros per litre.
According to Elysée spokesman David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their businesses regain competitiveness and to secure conditions of employment and remuneration for seafarers."
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected on a firm foot by fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted escargot operations in Morbihan and Calvados, causing stoppages of nearly 10 km.
The marina of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-Ile were not stopped.
A filter dam has been put in place on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors already showed their determination on Monday by burning, early in the morning, tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports of the Atlantic façade and the Manche, such as the Sands of Olonne, in Vendée, where the chalutiers remained at the quay, or the Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the movements of merchant ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantique, stopped the blockade of the important Total de Donges refinery in the evening.
The people of Boulogne-sur-Mer have decided to wait for Wednesday's meeting to decide on possible actions.
At Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" must decide on Tuesday the follow-up to the movement and its participation in the planned slow-down at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the National Fisheries Committee, which did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not let go of anything" and "do not want to move to Paris," for example, announced Liliane Cariou, chair of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay gasoline taxes, currently pay about 50 cents per litre, but they estimate that a boat’s profitability threshold is only reached with a gasoline less than 0.30 euros per litre.
Paul Newman the Magnificent
The unforgettable interpreter of "Butch Cassidy and the Kid" died of cancer at the age of 83 in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford or Sam Mendes have praised film legend and engaged actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecast in 2008
The Brazilian airliner tabled on 215 aircraft delivered this year despite threats of recession that are planning on the world economy.
The world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, maintains its delivery forecast for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, Fredrico Fleury Curado, its president, reaffirmed.
In the first half of the year, the airline delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects a lot from the Chinese market, especially for its range of aircraft ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG plans to assign more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group, which the U.S. monetary authorities have inflated, plans to hand over more than 15% of its assets to reimburse the <0x24>85 billion that has been forwarded to it, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to study the sale of most of its activities beyond its international life insurance and retired business in the United States, the newspaper cited sources close to the file.
AIG’s board of directors met on Sunday evening to consider possible assignments, according to the FT.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets AIG plans to secede include its International Lease Financial Corp. subsidiary, its 59% stake in Transatlantic Holdings, its real estate portfolio and private equity investments.
No final decision has been taken on these assignments, the FT continues.
AIG must quickly make liquidities to repay the <0x24>85 billion loan granted to it by the Federal Reserve at the risk of seeing U.S. authorities take 80% of its capital, duely diluting current shareholders.
Analysis Paris Historique de la séance Morning Meeting Historique Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported a historic fall on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson’s plan to save banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a never-before-seen loss of nearly 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) plunged from 777.68 points to 1O.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the strongest drop in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, the day after the 11 September terrorist attacks.
The Nasdaq, a technologically dominant index, dropped 199.61 points to 1,983.73 and the Standard & Poor's 500 expanded index to 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points), to 1,106.55 points, according to the final closing figures.
Already depressed at the start of the session, Wall Street pushed back after an unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the Banks Rescue Plan, which was supposed to allow for some stability in the markets.
By 228 votes against and 205 in favour, the representatives refused the resources he requested from Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson.
Almost two out of three Republicans rejected the plan.
“It’s a bad signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"This shows how much the market relied on this plan," she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days will not arrive "too late".
“If the project is indeed morbid (...) then the relay will be quickly passed to the Fed (the U.S. central bank, NDLR) and other central banks to manage the crisis, which would further tighten credit conditions,” warned Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
And further accentuating the sense of urgency, "every day that passes brings the fall of a financial institution" to the United States, Ms. Piegza stressed.
Following the Washington Mutual bankruptcy on Friday, the authorities arranged for the re-purchase of Wachovia’s banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated abruptly, prompting emergency interventions for banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets are facing “not only an American crisis, but a global crisis.”
The bond market has risen sharply.
The return on the 10-year Treasury bond fell to 3.632%, compared to 3.827% on Friday night, and that on the 30-year bond to 4.161%, compared to 4.357% on the eve.
Obama, winner of the first television duel
In the first debate on Friday between the two White House candidates succeeded another to find out who, from John McCain or Barack Obama, won it.
Unsurprisingly, Republican and Democratic campaign QGs proclaimed their own victory in this television duel that would have been followed by one-third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, though honorable, has not been "brilliant" enough to allow him to squeeze his fall in the five-week presidential polls.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion poll released on Saturday gives Obama a five-point lead (49% vs. 44% McCain), believes it was the Democrat who pulled his pin out of the game.
Among the undecided voters, who are the ones who count, Obama was the winner for 39% of the polls, while 25% of them concede the victory to McCain, according to a CBS poll.
Obama should be able to confirm his advance on Thursday with the expected good performance of his colleague, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
“It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
She has good instincts,” Clinton warned this weekend.
The Septuagint McCain did not cease to highlight his undisputed foreign policy experience, while highlighting his opponent’s “naïveness” on these issues that were at the heart of this first-hand.
“Senator Obama doesn’t seem to understand that...” he accused several times.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge needed to be president,” he said.
An angle of attack hammered since yesterday in Republican television advertisements.
Obama, he said, was the future.
Without dismantling, it proved concise and precise.
He highlighted his ability to make the right decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
“McCain still didn’t understand, while Obama, yes,” a democrat spotted this weekend accusing the Republican of not taking the full measure of the crisis’s impact on the “American of the Street.”
“During the ninety minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama said yesterday before 20,000 people gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina under heavy rain.
He didn't even pronounce the words "middle class" or "workers." The financial slump clearly benefits Obama, which is considered by the Americans as the most capable of saving the economy on the brink of precipitate.
"The coming week could be a decisive turning point," influential Democratic senator Charles Schumer said yesterday.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton administration, compared Obama’s “good economic instincts” to Bill Clinton’s during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current debacle “is the final eight-year verdict of a poor economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.”
Reaffirming that it would still manage to reduce taxes by 95% of Americans despite Wall Street's surpluses, the Illinois senator also noted that achieving possible energy independence by promoting renewable energy was his first priority, with a system of priority.
McCain said he wanted to build 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Crucially, the two candidates avoided questions about the <0x24>700 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>470 billion) financial bailout plan adopted by Congress last night and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "have you noticed that there was an election, you?"
Young people and opposition protested on Sunday evening on the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the legislative process in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening as polling stations closed down on Minsk’s central square to protest the fraudulent nature of the legislatures.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexander Loukachenko: "the dictator, resign".
Some admit not even having voted, "What good, as they will do what they want from my voice," says a young man.
They do not believe that the regime that has made good appear to foreign observers in order to resume language with the European Union is ready to take a democratic turn.
Sanctions, including the visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered clean by observers.
They did not, according to the opposition.
"We have been kept away from the electoral commissions and our observers have not been able to participate in the countdown," said Yuri Potemkine, a spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties.
"This is a cosmetic change," says Alexander Milinkievitch, former presidential opposition candidate in 2006 and leader of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is the votes, and for us it is the executive power.
If members of the opposition enter the parliament, they will be nominated, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean space on television, meetings in the regions, and bills.”
The opposition must therefore enter into the political game because "the dialogue with the European Union must begin.
For if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, goes into crisis, and we do not reform ourselves, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which followed the electoral process, will not recognize the validity of the election.
She stressed that participation figures seem too high, and that the generalization of the early vote (26% of the voters in Minsk) opened the vote to all manipulations.
"You have noticed that there was an election, you?" asked Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be no more than five opposition MPs in parliament, the ones that are best suited to power."
The silence of the night falls back on the square in October.
On television, President Loukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
The Interview - From the Blood Became Safe
Hema-Québec celebrated the 10th anniversary of its founding yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, was right to be glad, as Hema-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, he regained public confidence, which had been severely shaken by the blood-contaminated scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is well known, national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were contaminated with the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In February 1994, the Government of Canada instituted a public investigation, chaired by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations to prevent such a disaster from occurring.
While Judge Krever was delayed in filing his report, some provinces then set up a committee aimed at planning a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee has fulfilled this mandate.
Following the Gelineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were established in Canada: Hema-Québec to serve Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and both territories.
“In 1998, when Hema-Québec began its operations, only 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec,” recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
As a result of efforts to improve the safety of blood products and work on the ground over the following years, we regained public confidence,” she said before proudly affirming that by the beginning of 2008, nearly 94 percent of the Québec population now had confidence in Héma-Québec.
However, Dr. Décary keeps in mind that “trust is something extremely fragile.”
Since its inception on 28 September 1998, Hema-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, Europe witnessed the eclosion of many cases of the human form of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob’s disease, which has been strong since its foundation in 1998.
"And we didn't know at all if this disease could be transmitted through blood.
We then relied on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gelineau reports, according to which when it is not known and a serious disease can result from it, in the case of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain, which leads to the inevitability of the dead.
In April 1999, therefore, the blood of people who had been in the UK for more than a month since 1980 was refused.
Now, a few years ago, it has been demonstrated undoubtedly that this disease is transmitted through the blood.
This episode thus showed us that the precautionary principle that was applied made sense."
In 1999, a much more sensitive HIV screening technique appeared on the market: nucleic acid tests (TANs) that allow donors to detect directly in the blood the presence of the virus itself and not the presence of antibodies against the virus, on which the tests used so far relied.
TANs have shortened the silent period, which extends between the time the person was infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, the specialist explains.
This period could be reduced to a duration of less than one week.
This significantly reduced the risk that some donors would be infected without knowing it and could not be detected.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS by blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-contaminated blood.
In other words, it means that 12 million blood products will need to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
As Hema-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission occurs with a blood product.
I believe that today one can feel comfortable receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover health,” says the chief executive of Hema-Québec.
“Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
It is never known which pathogen will emerge in the system.
Not later than last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Reunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We need to be constantly vigilant," continues Dr. Décary, stressing that in addition to a secure supply, Hema-Québec must also provide for adequate supply.
“Needs are increasing because the population is getting older.
As anticancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need red blood cell or platelet recharge.
The ageing of the population also has consequences for the blood donor network, which averages only 3% of Quebecers eligible for blood donation."
Any healthy person aged 18 and over who meets the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who offer their blood are not accepted because they are infected with AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where malaria is severe, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
“With these 3%, we are able to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Deficiencies are very rare.
But members of this donor network need to be renewed as they age and can no longer donate their blood.
But it is difficult to convince people to donate their blood, but above all to hold them back and encourage them to become a regular donor.
Because today’s life is so scary, we rarely find time to spend an hour donating her blood,” said Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of <0x24>297 million, Hema-Québec provides not only blood products, but also human tissue, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is used almost exclusively for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québec, which also manages the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was once considered a biomedical waste is full of blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
“We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the banking of our thousandth sample of cord blood and we plan to collect more than a thousand of it every year.
We should start proposing it for transplants at the beginning of next year,” says Dr. Décary, describing this cord blood sampling program as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that there is no access to it," because Hema-Québec does not have the means to offer this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Soccer - The Impact in the semi-finals
The Impact of Montreal qualified for the semi-final round of the USL first division eliminatory series, thanks to a 3-1 (4-3 in total goals) victory at the expense of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, in the second and decisive match of the series, in the final quarter-finals of the Stapu.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After a goalless first half on one side and on the other, midfielders David Testo and Rocco Plancentino scored the other nets of Montreal.
Roger Levesque was the only one to play Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
In the first round of the series, on Friday, Impact suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, suburb of Seattle.
The impact will be measured at the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semi-finals.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder filled a 3-1 deficit in the return game to win it 4-3, but the Whitecaps still reached the 5-4 semi-final round in total goals.
The Impact is expected to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In short - Kovalev's Victorious Goal
The Canadian’s number one trio is ready to start the season.
The team composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostisyn animated the attack in a 3-2 win for the Canadian in the dam shots against the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Centre.
Kostisyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec amassed two assists, and Kovalev collected a pass in this win, the fourth of the Tricolore in six preliminary matches.
Kovalev gave the victory by marking the only goal of the shooting.
"I'm not ready yet," the Russians warned.
I need another game to feel comfortable.”
“He tried to do too much in the first half,” said Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He had a good ovation.”
Charest set in the North
The Prime Minister does not rule out opening elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the general council of the Liberal Party was finished, Jean Charest went yesterday to Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new health minister, Yves Bolduc (left), tries to get elected on the occasion of today’s partial election.
"Delaying the limits of our last great northern border": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual strength while remaining on the big lines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, was projected some kind of Moulin to images.
They were shooting in loop, on three huge screens, spectacular shots of hydroelectric dams, mining, Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great means, as in the election period.
In a press release, the prime minister declined to exclude that he would trigger the elections this fall, even though he noted that his schedule was very busy.
The “Plan Nord” is the fourth pan of a “vision” that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a “new economic space”, which includes an agreement on labour with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory at 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the prime minister has only explained why the North was "a jewel with immense potential", but has not given a deadline, investment amounts, or specific priority in future projects.
At the very least a few avenues of what could be further developed: including hydroelectricity, forestry, but above all the mining sector, dominated by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamond," according to Mr. Charest's list.
This “territory is twice the size of France”, “it’s at home, it’s in Quebec.
Not only is it at home, but it’s in us,” he insisted, as well as to show that he was sparking a national founding myth.
Quebec has built itself a lot in its relationship with the North, he stressed: the gold rush in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added, after taking a theatrical break to contemplate the huge map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec’s territory, comprises a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the prime minister said at a press conference.
“This is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a very long time, and when the opportunity arises, I repeat that position on behalf of the government," he said.
“With climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North,” he said, speaking of the passage of the northwest, which will open all year round due to the melting of ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pequist MP of Ungava), have already started consultations with some thirty communities.
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important place has begun work.
The prime minister does not exclude a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when "we will give ourselves a common vision".
The development of the North would also be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be “concerned, orderly and environmentally friendly,” he said.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as being in continuity with that of Liberal Prime Ministers who preceded it.
“Like the liberals who preceded us, we have thought differently to turn the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was also one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which started on Friday with a big cocktail to mark the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s arrival at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions proposed to rename the Beauharnois Central in Adélard-Godbout Barrage.
“De Godbout, who created Hydro-Québec, to Lesage, who made the Revolution quiet and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, who made the James Bay, our party has been able to forge the future,” said Jean Charest.
In a press point, he invoked another reference, the conservative one, the "Roads to the North" program by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
In addressing the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Mr. Charest stressed that its commissioning was planned for 2012.
“It’s still between us, but I plan to be there,” he told his activists, sparking nourishing applause at home.
Indeed, the prime minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of triggering an election this fall, which the law allows.
He pointed out that his schedule was filled, notably by a mission of the Federation Council in China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The General Council at the end of the week provided the Liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including "constitutional aspirations" that have been passed as a letter to the post: the PLQ in particular calls for recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and to have a veto on decisions taken in Quebec.
On the opposition side, the main lines of the North Plan were welcomed with skepticism.
The head of Pekistan, Pauline Marois, highlighted the Northern Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government launched in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, refused to apply it.
If he had done so, "we would have been more advanced today", commented Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (scrutiny that takes place today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ said it supports the adoption of a North Plan by the government.
"But what we want is that it's not just a show," said leader Sébastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who comes on holiday today.
Letters - A Dishonored Country
It was Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (or irony) at Harper's office, who last summer allowed herself to say of Louise Arbour that she was a "host" for Canada.
To throw the blame on this woman who has led an unceasing struggle for justice and who deserves all our admiration says so much about the Prime Minister's surroundings as on Stephen Harper himself.
We are here before a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, not to have repatriated its citizen imprisoned in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager at the time of the facts that he was accused of.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, refuses to speak and lets a child-soldier crumble under inhumane conditions.
The only one who turns to a court parody to assess the guilt of the accused.
As a reminder, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, are advocating for the repatriation of Omar Khadr so that he can enjoy a fair trial in Canada.
It is the same government that closes its eyes on torture: it doesn’t matter if a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, probably never after so many years of execution.
We do not realize it yet, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedoms and our "democracy", a word that Harper does not stop blaming and that sounds so hollow in his mouth.
This is the time when no morality exists: one can harass, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen at the right will of a so-called minority head of government (so what will happen after October 14...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that advocates Virtue, Law, and Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what made our country’s reputation and dignity.
The shame, Mr. Toews, is there, in this resignation, and nowhere else.
Free opinion - The Orwellian Speech by Barrick Gold
In its September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice President Director of Canadian Mine Barrick Gold.
According to Orwellian logic, the largest gold company in the world has filed a six-million-dollar lawsuit against three authors and a small publishing house with no hesitation in launching a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of defamation prosecutions, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
Because, for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to ruin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his own?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and publishers of the Black Canada book will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defense and fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless pockets of the mine.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a friendly settlement that will stifle the opposition in addition to frightening anyone who dares to look at the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was in front of the public that she should have presented her vision of the facts.
Unlike in some of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are usually conducted through exchange of ideas and not by a mattress.
It was therefore sufficient for the mining to open its books, records and establish a real debate, through newspapers, media, publications and the funding of independent research teams that could have made light of the issue.
But Barrick Gold doesn’t seem to trust public opinion and rejects petitions and letters of support to Black Canada’s authors.
Perhaps Mr. Garver could explain how he can ask for a "public" debate at the same time while disdaining the opinions of that same public?
In the Vice-President's world, it seems that this word refers only to fatly paid lawyers and not to all Canadians; this is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In democracy, even detractors have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - is that the public that supports Black Canada's authors and publishers does so primarily because it rejects the brutal mining way.
This audience is ready to hear Barrick and to judge, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of arguments, and not in the context of what many perceive as a prosecution (encouraging the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just filed a deposition in this place of the use of Canada's authors.
Beyond Garver’s surreal speech, Barrick Gold’s prosecution is a direct attack on academic research freedom and the quest for truth, essential to any democratic society.
It denies the right to cite credible sources and debate on facts and interpretations, which are the very basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss topics that displease the rich businesses of this world in a country like Canada, under repeated prosecution, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Black Canada.
She has a right to replicate.
The academic environment we belong to has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's over-the-counter prosecution clearly shows that, contrary to her claim, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the academic world, as well as for public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place measures limiting this type of abusive prosecution.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans Agree
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest economic bailout plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the <0x24>700 billion plan aimed at curbing the financial crisis that has shaken Wall Street for months is yet to be endorsed by both houses of Congress.
It provides, inter alia, for better control by elected officials of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of the public money committed, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized for non-payment, and a right to look at the salaries paid to the managers of the assisted enterprises.
US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, and Republican Representative at the negotiating table Senator Judd Gregg announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, at the end of a two-day marathon of negotiating.
“We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets,” said Bush administration spokesman Henry Paulson.
“Everything has been done to protect the real economy and the ordinary Americans from the ongoing crisis in Wall Street,” she said.
“This is the fundamental point: if we don’t do this, trauma, chaos and disturbances about Americans’ daily lives will be immense,” Republican Judd Gregg said.
Negotiations had turned to the sprint in recent hours for fear of the effect that would cause a new failure on the mood of investors.
The time limit we had agreed was the opening of the markets this morning.
Lately associated with the negotiations, the two candidates in the U.S. presidential election proved rather favourable to the agreement, but did not hesitate to express their dissatisfaction with the fact that they were forced to reach that end.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has attributed the addition of certain provisions to the agreement, including the one aimed at allowing owners to keep their homes and the one on the salary of state-rescued business executives.
“When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is nothing to congratulate.
But these measures are necessary,” he commented on U.S. television.
Asked on another channel if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: “I’d like to see the details, but I hope so.”
“The big lines I’ve read [show] that it’s something we’re all going to have to digest and with which we’re going to be able to move forward.
The option of not doing anything is simply unacceptable,” he said.
The <0x24>700 billion plan aims to redeem the dubious, risky and unsold assets of U.S. financial institutions with taxpayer money.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the explosion of a real estate bubble that first led to the collapse of risky mortgage credits (subprimes) before extending to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAAs) and liquidity banking and bank debits.
It was a group of Republicans who had the first draft of the deal, last week.
It is believed to have emerged from this impasse since Democrats have accepted that certain “toxic” assets of companies in difficulty are only secured by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to round the corners for everyone in Congress, a provision was also added that if the government had to take on losses for five years with this program, it could set up new taxes to help it recover its implementation.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first tranche of 250 billion, to which another 100 billion will be added if the president deems it necessary.
Another <0x24>350 billion is expected to be repaid by another Congressional vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will get shares in the rescued companies that will be worth him dividends in case of profit and that he will be able to resell when the turmoil has passed.
The federal government will have the opportunity to delay the seizure proceedings regarding housing related to the real estate loans covered by the plan, as well as to set limits on the remuneration and start-up allowances paid to the managers of the affected companies.
The architects of the plan would like to see it submitted to the House of Representatives vote today, and to the Senate vote on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will have the green light.
Yesterday, votes continued to rise against this project, both in the Republican and Democrats camps.
"Obviously, Washington doesn't hear you," Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House's Finance Commission, told voters.
“Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that is to benefit the taxpayers.”
An animator of a small group in Congress called "the caucus of skeptics", Democratic representative Brad Sherman presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred prominent professors of economics, including three Nobel laureates, wrote to us to tell us: Congress is being asked not to rush and carefully examine the way forward,” he said.
At the same time, in Europe, there was once again evidence of the global nature of the crisis.
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three countries of Benelux announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.2 billion (<0x24>16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was renouncing to acquire its competitor in full shipwreck since it lost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2 billion (US<0x24>2.9 billion) in the loan crisis.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the 20 largest European banks and 10 largest insurers.
"It's not the money lost," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
In exchange, the right to vote in the bank and the influence is regained.
It’s just something that savers and households appreciate now that times are uncertain.”
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Channel, the British government seemed to be about to nationalize another bank undermined by the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over all current loans from Bradford and Bringley Bank, including more than 41 billion (US<0x24>75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to be nationalized by the British government since the start of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a Committed Icon
Its beauty in the eyes of azure has long been its asset card, some will say its weakness.
Had he been released from the narcissistic mirror, the American actor with a charming smile?
Yes and no.
His pussy, sensitivity, and a talent that flowed from source have also removed him from the registry of power that gives birth to the true sacred monsters.
What a great runner!
Paul Newman, who disappeared on Friday at the age of 83, after a lung cancer in his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the fast years.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and of whom he had long been a sort of screen rival, more cautious in his play, certainly more fragile, but also apostle of freedom and the breakup of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 to a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without measurable ego, ultimate quality brand.
For he projected a whole country full of self-made man, from the Pacific War fighter wounded to the battle, who in the early 1950s studied dramatic art in Yale and then attended New York's Actor's Studio, before triumphing in theatre, television, soon in cinema.
The same man who campaigned for civil rights was also the car driver who ranked second in the 24 Hours of Mans in 1979, doubled with a sex symbol, although he was a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
Also with him disappear the shadow areas of this secret, discreet, engaged star, allergic to the bursts of the show-business, of which one will not have completely pierced the enigma.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
The disappearance of Paul Newman has been a source of dizziness for cinematographers this weekend, as his big roles swirl on the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of a seventh American art in perpetual mutation parades through it.
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in La Chatte on a burning roof adapted by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we mention his sensitive Mr. Bridge, troubled in his old age by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
So many others Paul Newman have gone to history.
This Rocky Graziano, criminal, tortured, violent, unforgettable boxer in Somebody Up There Likes Me, by Robert Wise, a role destined for James Dean, reprised after his death, who really launched Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic mischief in the brilliant The Sting (The Arnaque), Oscar for best film in 1973.
A bitter and vengeful billiard player in Robert Rossen's magnificent The Hustler (1961), he will take the character on the return in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which rated him in 1987 his only Oscar out of nine nominations.
That face across the ages, it was him.
It's him again.
Epochs are buzzing through its course.
The young people know him especially through George Roy Hill's cultist Slap Shot (1977), Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans met him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy by the Coen brothers.
With a last role as a sponsor of the Irish mafia in Sam Mendes's 2003 Road to Perdition, the loop was closed.
In the face of several film legends who left the job early enough, Newman will remain in a chair for a long time, while denouncing Hollywood, its bears, fasts and concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, not without humour, "as a living challenge to "underplaying" judging its overly supportive performances.
The profession has not always been tender for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom roles fell for a long time all cooked in the beak.
However, he played less often the first young than the marginal: neurotic, alcoholic, dirty or desperate, whose perfect traits reflected the drifts and revolts.
As a director, Newman reveals little-known facets of his true pudic sensitivity.
His Rachel Rachel, in 1968 (after the novel by Canadiana Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew an endless female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott by overdose dedicated to him his 1984 film Harry and Son, a work of chagrin and sadness.
Among the rain of tribute yesterday on Newman, his great friend and former gun companion Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very sadly: "His presence has made my life and this country better."
Generosity, love of existence are vibrant features of the missing actor.
Beyond his legendary career, there is also a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a contestant of the Hollywood derives.
You will have seen a lot of her binet crowned on pots of vinegar, sauces, cookies and other foods, judging the process of quite bad taste, though gag at first.
Nonetheless, the profits from these sales were paid to his Foundation for Children in Difficulty.
Newman, instead of sitting on his myth, will be engaged to the end.
He left to his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be here.”
And it is a privilege for us to have followed the path of such a lucid and generous American artist.
Citizen model, in summary and above.
What could Zuschlag & amp; Company well manufacture in their invoice factory?
Next, on October 8, the hearings relating to the ongoing criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his accomplices will begin.
The politician and his accomplices are charged with fraud, in the form of a criminal organization, permanently and on a regular basis, which has caused particularly significant damage. Other prosecutors have been detained against them, such as false and false use.
According to the prosecution, money from subsidies was spent for personal purposes, while benefits were justified by fake invoices.
The money from the state and municipalities, about HUF 65 million in total, went on the one hand into the boxes of the Fiatal Balloldal movement and on the other, into the pockets of some people.
Their method, also made public by the investigating authorities, was to touch on the money of the grants obtained by issuing cost invoices, behind which no actual benefit was provided and thus the associations never complied with their commitments.
According to the indictment, much of the bills were fake.
For the latter, they procured invoices in the market of Józsefváros, while they manufactured the stamps in Kiskunhalas.
For the names of companies that were to appear on the invoices, it was decided, among other things, during the tours in the northern province of Lake Balaton, carried out by István Lados, at the request of János Zuschlag.
According to the latter's statement, he was to find pensions and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, he asked for an invoice, the model of which they would make the other invoices they would introduce, among other things, to the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the Municipality of the Capital to access subsidies.
The majority of the invoices were created by István Lados and his accomplice András <0xC5><0x90>ri, who, according to our information, was primarily concerned with the preparation of the records necessary for obtaining the grants.
During a "tracking circuit", one of Lados' choices was a bistro.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlag in 2003, this place has ensured the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
However, according to the manager, it would have been impossible for so many people to occupy this place at the same time.
In the same way, in the summer of 2002, the invoice established on behalf of the Jobb Jö<0xC5><0x91>étr<0xC3><0xA6>rt foundation, which would subsequently bear the name of Együtt a Third <0xC3><0x88>vesredért, was filled with defects in shape and background.
A guest house, located in Badacsonytomaj, actually had only three rooms, and a maximum of ten people could spend the night there. Yet, the invoice mentioned one hundred and thirty customers.
The issuers of overwhelmingly imaginative invoices also fell into excess when they mentioned the company Pigal Kft, which also belongs to the Horeca sector. In their accounting, neither the name of Jobb Jö<0xC5><0x91><0xC3><0xA5>rt nor the name of the Hoppá appeared, according to the information in the park.
Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas, the company’s manager, told the website hvg.hu that when the prosecutor called him and showed him the invoices, he immediately knew that it was fake documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were placed in a wrong place on the seal."
He added: "Beyond form, the fact that according to the invoice, a hundred people lived there, also did not collate, since this establishment has only eleven rooms, which do not have as much space.
In addition, the invoice also mentions meals, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time."
The invoices issuers have also not been informed about the travel agencies in Budapest, being part of their choice, but organising only travel abroad. Thus, they naively indicated stays in Hungary on invoices to be paid in cash, which also applies to the practice of the travel agencies.
In addition, as shown in the investigation, they also added VAT on these documents, while the benefits relating to travel activities, which are located outside the European Union, are billed without VAT.
Similarly, the VAT rate of the four invoices established on behalf of the Hotel Révfülöp on the order of Jobb Jö<0xC5><0x91><0xC3><0xBD><0xC3><0xA5>rt was incorrect, since the company's benefits do not support a VAT of 25% as indicated, but a VAT of 15%.
The prosecution's investigation reveals that the "emitters" also made mistakes in mentioning as provision the transport of goods by road, which the invoicing company could not exercise, as its profile was the investment advice.
In addition, it is also for vices of forms, such as inadequate invoices and false stamps, that the invoices issued in the order of Egjutt a Third millerét Alapítvány, of XXI. Századi Kulturáls Egyesület and of Biztos Pont have proved to be false.
As in the case of the company Ravenna Bt. or the sports internship in Kunfehértó, both of which deny to be the authors of the invoices issued on their behalf.
The counterfeiters also did not pay attention to the fact that the company HIB Kft., established in Nyíregyháza, was in liquidation at the time when (in 2001) the Fiatal Városért Egyesület group was supposed to take a meal at their home.
Invoices deliberately established
Another category of invoice issuers is that of those who were fully aware that they were being asked to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation, at the request of the Young Baloldal Group - Ifjú Szocialisták, established an invoice to the order of the foundation Egyjütt a Third <0xC3><0x88>vezrét, for a sum of HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the manager of the company Collab Kft. was led to issue fake invoices by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi.
It also cooperated with the Zuschlags, the company Biogate Kft., which is currently in liquidation and which in 2003 issued invoices on behalf of the foundation Jobb Jö<0xC5><0x91><0xC3><0xA5>rt Alapítvány, the association Atlasz Egyesület and the association Vörösfeny<0xC5><0x91> Egyesület.
There was no financial movement, either, since the invoices issued were subsequently cancelled, but the agencies did not mention it in their accounts.
The following category of invoicing companies is that of companies directly related to the accused.
Thus, the Administrative Delegate of the General Manager of the company Delta Trió Kft., dealing with the trade of fuel and motor vehicles, whose headquarters was in Budapest, but where it was not found, was Iván Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices relating to the sale of IT equipment, for an amount of approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the investigation, these equipments were purchased by Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which had been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The director of the company was a man of Romanian origin, to whom Ivan Kubatov had also submitted documents related to the company, between 2002 and 2005.
According to what we know, Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued invoices on behalf of Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt to the Third Évezredért Alapítvány companies, and that he impounded their counter-value.
It was precisely at the request of Iván Kubatov that Romanian masons created the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, none of these companies were operating, which is what the defendant explains by the fact that they were not receiving work.
However, he used these companies, since at the request of Master Zsolt Szente, co-accused and editor of the founding acts of the companies, he established invoices on their behalf, in the order of associations related to Zuschlag, such as the associations Atlasz and Y-Generation.
Kubatov has given 15 invoices to organizations, issued by the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, for a value of HUF 14.2 million.
The prosecutor thought that 10% of the sums indicated on the invoices and the VAT went into Kubatov’s pocket.
The man even used the company Szi-Beri Bt. to establish fictitious invoices that were used as part of the Biztos Pont grant application.
In January 2006, the Association Y-Generação et Szövetség a Modern Hungary submitted a grant application to the public utility agency of the socialist party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They received this subsidy for HUF 500,000 twice, but these amounts were not used for the purposes indicated in the application.
To prevent this from happening, five fictitious invoices received from the company Works Team Kft. were presented to the TMA.
Moreover, it is these invoices that were found during the search carried out in the office of <0xC3><0x81>rpád Kemecsei, at the Ministry of Education.
During the hearing, some of the defendants will report on the method of making the invoices, as they had already done before the prosecutor’s office.
What might be really interesting would be that the main accused, János Zuschlag himself, decides to lift the veil over the whole story.
So far, his confessions are not very detailed, and although he has promised several times to tell the smallest details, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest, or perhaps the socialists would have concluded an agreement that in exchange for the reimbursement of a large part of the fifty million HUF, Zusi would wear the hat alone.
Today, the latter is likely to be vexed, as applications for his placement in a monitored residence, based on an alleviation of his detention conditions, are continuously falling into the ear of a deaf person.
While those who have caused much more serious damage, and the perpetrators of irreparable economic offences, freely or at least, wait at their own home for the end of the procedure. He does not have this possibility.
The Psychology of Oversight: Why Do We Spend More Money?
When auctioning, buyers tend to spend more, and overestimate the merchandise.
Researchers in neurology and economics at the University of New York managed to update the neurological and economic bases of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to their study published in the journal Science, humans don’t want to be distanced during this type of competition, such as an auction on eBay, and that’s why they even prefer to pay too high a price.
These researches have attempted to draw up a neurological scheme of this kind of "game" using experimental auction sales.
One group of volunteers played the lottery, while the other group participated in a game auction, while using a functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) method, the researchers analyzed the active brain areas of the experimental subjects.
In both games, participants could earn money, but during the auction of which an essential element is the overspending of a third, the set under the brain trunk, called the striatum, was put in intensive motion during the loss of the game.
This part of the brain, along with several other functions, plays a role in the mechanism of "self-stimulation" of the nervous system.
This is why, according to the researchers, the price rise is explained by the leak from the violent reaction of the striatum.
In support of their theories, the economists of this group of researchers pursued financial surveillance analyses.
During these, three groups overlisted in front of a partner, in various circumstances.
They simply informed the control group of the actual value of the product in question, and thus they made their bet.
To another group, they promised that if, in addition, they came out winning the game, then they would receive an additional <0x24>15, a reward.
While the third group received these <0x24>15 before the auction, the group members also lost that money, in case they lost the auction.
The difference between these two groups is in fact that the emphasis was placed in one on victory, while in the other, on failure.
By proving the neurologists' hypothesis, the players' team members were willing to make higher bets than those made by the control group and the victory group.
“These results cannot be demonstrated by any existing economic theory.
In fact, each of them explained the phenomena found during auctions only by the pleasure of winning and the parade in front of the risk.
Only neurological imaging methods have helped to eliminate the contradiction between the two theories by now leading to a third explanation." - Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When Should We Consult a Doctor?
Worldwide, about half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary, chronic liver disease is mentioned among the leading causes of death.
It is estimated that there are 100 miles of hepatitis virus patients in Hungary, but only seven miles follow treatment, which is because patients often do not know that they are infected.
The name hepatitis is a generic name given to infections affecting the liver and caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. Inflammation of the liver and jaundice are characteristic, but pathogens and diseases generated differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses, according to the pathogenic genes, spread mainly in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example: contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses by blood and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal secretion, saliva).
For travelers, it is recommended to get vaccinated against viruses A and B. There is no vaccine against C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after consuming contaminated foods, usually accompanied by a poor general condition, weakness, stomach aches and nausea.
Then a visible yellowing develops on the skin and on the white of the eye, the stools become clearer and the urine takes a darker color.
Worldwide, every year, one million people die from the most serious form of this disease, such as liver cancer or cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main cause of this is that, according to estimates, only one in ten patients receive medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if not treated, it can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most patients do not know that they are infected with the virus, because the pathogenic gene sullenly destroys liver cells. In many cases, the first symptoms appear only after 20-30 years.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, as well as regular screening tests.
Contamination is much higher than average among a population of three: people who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and tattoos.
Currently, there are 200 million patients with chronic hepatitis C in the world.
Since the disease can be detected by a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult your doctor treating as soon as symptoms of unknown origin are observed.
The disease can be cured, if detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, in this way the risk of infection disappears and the development of cancer is prevented.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, organized for the first time in 2004 by organizations representing patients from all over the world.
Its goal is to draw attention to the chronic cirrhosis of the liver, caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Does anyone who believes in God feel less pain?
According to the results of a recent research, religious belief would function as a kind of analgesic, which would have already helped make the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
The British daily Telegraph published an article according to which researchers at the University of Oxford made an interesting experiment by analyzing how much faith in God can influence human pain tolerance.
As part of this experiment for the least bizarre, 12 Catholic believers and as many atheists were subjected to electroshocks, while each of them was observing a painting representing the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholics were able to exclude much of the suffering.
Thanks to a human brain palpation technique, it was also found that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for the regulation of pain.
This analysis is the first of a series of experiments, in which academics, scholars, philosophers and theologians participate from different sectors of the university.
Specifically, the experiment takes place as follows: an instrument emitting flashes and diffusing electroshocks is fixed on the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to look sustainedly at two paintings, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady in the Hermine painted by Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century.
The researchers at the origin of this experience hoped that the vision of the Virgin Mary evokes some kind of state of faith among believers, while the choice of Da Vinci’s painting, not very different from the first, was about its calming effect.
The experimental subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during this time, received 20 electrochoques in four parts successively, while looking at either religious-themed or more general-themed painting.
Catholics said that in the sight of the Virgin Mary, they felt like "safe", like someone "cared for" and they "relaxed, and peace invaded them."
In view of the painting of religious themes, they saw 12% less pain than when they looked at Leonard’s work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself took part in the experiment, thinks that the same effects can be achieved with any other strong image, in atheists, provided they find the appropriate photo.
“We should find an image that they react very positively, such as a mother or a father,” the psychologist said.
Tom Wright, an Anglican bishop, welcomed the results of this research.
“The practice of faith should change and in many cases it actually changes our personality,” Wright added.
After these excellent results, the question remains of what would be the effect on the regulation of the pain of the subjects if the believers were shown a Madonna painted by Leonardo or by a painter of the same caliber?
Would the view of a better-quality Virgin Mary produce better results?
You are what you reveal about yourself.
On the occasion of its tenth anniversary, Google claims that it can be found at the bottom of people's pockets just as the sky above their heads. He knows where they spent their holidays, what specialists they consult and what their centres of interest are.
However, this is not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the most influential people in society.
While in terms of skeptics establishing a parallel with Orwell’s horrific vision, they just don’t see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s main ambition is to gather even more information about its users. This is necessary so that the founders of Google can meet their initial goal, which sounded as follows: “Let’s gather all the information in one system!”
According to the Google manager, after ten years of global smuggling, they are still only at the beginning of their goals of being able to process all the information.
To the question: what will be there in five years? Schmidt answered that he would like Google to be able to answer questions like "What could I do tomorrow?" or "What work would be best for me?". However, software will not be able to answer this kind of question, just on the first day of the user's call, where it will only be able to answer the questions.
It is not perfectly clear to all Internet users that the words used during internet searches, the IP address of the computer that launches the search, and the pages then viewed by the interested parties are precisely listed.
Through the Personalized Search program launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own search history and can view what they have searched for, what they have clicked on. Thanks to this, in the long term, Recommendations, program based on the same logic, will be able to give products based on our own and more personalized responses, and will be able to provide our products based on our own and more personalized services.
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if they look at what my job is? ask users, who are worried about seeing Google’s information monopoly.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by society that can stir up fear, and it is not the murder, the fear of punishment, the desire for freedom, or possibly the revolt against power that can stir up a counter-reaction among Internet users.
However, it is a confirmed fact that the requested terms are not only recorded, but in justified cases, they are passed on to a third party, and in such legal case, nothing protects the personal rights of Internet users.
The most reluctant example of recent times is probably the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google transmitted to the Brazilian government the information it had collected on the public page called Orkut, thus allowing identification.
Internet users concerned about human rights were able to push a whirlwind of relief last May, when Google, arm-bearing with the EFF legal protection agency, proved its right to the court in front of the FBI. According to the judgement, in the future, Google will not be able to say that any information on the nature of the information will always be required by the law enforcement agency.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms that it had won in relation to the strengthening of the Child Protection Act, voted several years earlier. But in the end, it was unable to obtain the last two search lists of these websites and the private user lists.
Google’s judgment is therefore quite contradictory: it is stifled by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their intimate sphere and their private domain suffer from it when they begin to use Google services. As a result, they manifest themselves in their multi-images in the spirit of society that keeps them from stealing.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its "wilds" bringing together the passionate, activists and enthusiastic computer users who appear in many countries see in Google the next generation of big companies, the "branched corporation", as opposed to its same rival, Microsoft, and all of them as cataloged in the same way.
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for ID code, does not ask for money for its applications. The documentary code and the program package, continuously refreshed, has a much more accessible, younger and cooler effect, in the face of the official software giant's practice.
The reason may also be that geeks see very precisely the problematic relationship between human rights and the internet, and what Web 2.0, the most proclaimed keyword of recent years, draws right behind it.
In fact, Web 2.0 is nothing but collaboration, but the fact that we intentionally leave traces behind us, and that we use communication channels at our disposal, and while the dimension of these changes one by one, the main thing remains the same: we are exposed.
A young person, in general, can keep a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and he can even link them to other services, such as Twinter, or last.fm, listing his musical habits. Then he can link them to a system of prosecution, which can also be linked to them, such as FriendFeed or Flipfs.
While we can get acquainted with many examples of terms, such as that of the girlfriend who easily understands in view of the morning photos, taken by the circle of common friends, with whom her unfaithful friend spent the evening, or the thing of the company that has fired one of our employees, we can acknowledge that on the whole thing, it's only from the blog to the opinions that it's private.
The person who lives an online life is made up of what he shows himself, and this is how one can define the principle behind the behavior of today’s youth.
He wants to hide something, or at least wants to try to circumvent Google’s monopoly, can do so (starting, for example, with Scroogle, using the Google search engine, but at the same time leaving no trace intentionally).
The number of people who, deliberately, do not register on public pages so that it is not possible to find them, is not the least. The services of Google online, from text processing to image processing, to reading information can be replaced by our day-to-day information, which is better served, which are not standardized, and which are not standardized.
Public opinion awaits, without really hiding, the moment when Google will unveil its true nature.
The company, with its current value of <0x24>156 billion, is worth more than IBM (<0x24>140 billion), Intel (<0x24>124 billion) or Coca-Cola (<0x24>110 billion). AdWords/AdSense advertising domains only threaten the turnover of AdWords/AdSense advertisers, not the number of other advertisers, but the rate of reporting more rapidly.
However, critical observers find, aside from all of this, contradictions that have disturbing effects: for example, the top management of the company has already rejected, in its entirety, the protests of the employees, after it has doubled the price of the parent company, and after that the company has decided that they are all too interested in the restoration of the company.
According to one of the company's internal rules, the benefits of the new services are not announced only when they can be used from system analysis. What's on is that in the next few months and years, they're going to make the world move on a few new points. While some people think that we're going to go into a complex of ours, we're going to go back to Google're going to another of ours, we're going to archiving of our books.
The fact that Google builds a genetic database can give a good raw material to the next generation of science-fiction authors. The novel by the famous Cory Doctorow, written with half-tone Orwellian, describes the future in which a man could be approached in a scary way only through Google data.
Two minors helped make traces of <0xC3><0x93>zd’s double murder disappear
"The police have summoned two minors to interrogate them in the case of the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd. Based on reasonable suspicions, they have helped make the traces of the crime disappear," - said the spokesman for the Borsod department's office.
The young people have acknowledged the facts that have been blamed on them, and so far they are accused of complicity.
The two minors, who, according to information from MTI (Hungarian Telegraph Agency) are young girls, defend themselves freely.
Complicity in murder can result in a detention period of up to 5 years.
The suspect of the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd, a 23-year-old young man in the corner, was placed in interim detention on Sunday.
The chiefs of charges held against him are multiple homicide, committed with premeditation and interest.
During the investigation, it was found that the 23-year-old owed a large sum of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to pay his debt and that's why he pulled his creditor, Wednesday, to a site in <0xC3><0x93>zd where he killed him, as well as the 9-year-old's daughter.
According to MTI's information, the young man prevented his crime, and the weapon with which he was going to commit his hidden crimes at the scene of the crime is proof of this.
The police examine the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists.
Warsaw Stock Exchange Makes Proposal for Purchase of Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros, about five billion Czech crowns, for the resale of 100% of the Prague Stock Exchange’s stock market.
Ludwik Sobolewski, the president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed this proposal that the Poles made despite the fact that the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wants to separate more than 60% of its shares in a few months of activity.
According to the Czech economic daily E15, the Polish proposal represents the highest offer ever made for the re-purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have made an offer to date.
Petr Koblic, the director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among the interested parties, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the best new owner, and did not exclude the fact that this could lead to the disappearance of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated to be between 5 and 10 billion Czech kroner by market experts.
Based on an agreement between shareholders, some 90% of the papers would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance, with approximately 25 percent of the shares, followed by 14.7 percent of the bank Ceská Sporitelna and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
In their comments on Tuesday on the international financial crisis, which are getting worse from day to day, European press leaders already mention a "second September 11".
"The global financial disaster is owed to the American president," accuses the newspaper La Repubblica of Rome. "The president has not even been able to block with his own party behind a bill, improvised on the go, aimed at bringing relief to a desperate situation."
Instead of a new Pearl Harbour, as billionaire Warren Buffett mentioned, it is more appropriate to talk about a second September 11th.
Part of the Madrid press also sees the emissary goat in Washington.
According to the newspaper El Mundo, it is the failures of the political leadership there that have brought the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the U.S. financial system is increasing every day, and then the whole world will pay the high price.
Bush’s plan was far from perfect, however, according to the congressional vote, a real threat, that Washington does not propose a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the void, just at the moment when in the history of capitalism, one of the greatest transformations takes place.
The threat can’t be ignored any longer,” the Geneva Days-Anzeiger said.
Some states may still lend a lifeboat to their holding financial institutions, and thanks to the money of their taxpayers, they can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if even more banks collapse like dominoes, then neither financial means nor new improvisations will be enough.
In the long run, we need that the states of the European Union make little sense of their national selfishness, and that they centralize control over divided financial markets.
Only on Monday, weakened financial institutions received more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion - recalled the Vienna daily Der Standard, which adds that the fears that European taxpayers will also have to put their hands on the pocket, very deep, in a similar way to Americans in order to more realistic, to remedy the problem.
So far, the EU has not really taken care of the crisis, which, like a tsunami, traverses partly the old continent.
The "savers" should not immediately burn 100 billion euros, on the other hand, it would be wise if they noted in what case it would be rational to touch taxpayers' money, with the aim of preventing further damage.
The smart car mimics the burgundy’s flight
What method would be better to develop technologies capable of avoiding an obstacle, if it is not the imitation of an existing obstacle detector in nature?
Like the bees, for example.
In the amazing project presented at CEATEC, which took place in Japan, the donor bees gave Nissan engineers the strategic idea of starting to inspire them on how to design the next generation of obstacle detectors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built a mini robot car, a bio-inspired self-roboting system, type BR23C, which it has equipped with bees qualities, the ultimate goal being to encourage the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
During its flights, each bee forms its own, oval-shaped space, which in reality looks a lot like our secure protective shell - explained, during the exhibition, Kazuhhiro Doi, the head of the brand's research and development department and technology public relations.
The bee’s faceted eye plays a key role, since it is able to see in all directions, at an angle of 300 degrees.
To mimic the functions of the eye with facets, engineers approached the idea of the laser telemeter.
It identifies the obstacles at an angle of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 meters in front of the BR23C, it evaluates the distances and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately turns it into a avoidance maneuver.
The perception of the obstacle takes place in a fraction of a second. Then, the mini auto robot, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes the direction of its wheels by turning it at an angle sufficient to avoid collision.
Unlike any current system, this avoidance maneuver takes place entirely instinctively.
“If it weren’t, the mini auto robot wouldn’t be able to react quickly enough to avoid the obstacle,” said Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotic car project.
It must react instinctively and instantly, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and innermost layer of the protective envelope, a layer where the collision is currently considered inevitable.
All this process should reflect what the bee does to avoid the other bees.
The process must take place at a glance.
Unlike bees, the difference cannot go upwards, downwards or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction in which the wheels can rotate.
In this way, instead of the infinite combinations that bees possess to avoid other bees, in our case, we could only use rotary motion, acceleration as well as slowdown as maneuvers at the disposal of the mini auto robot.
The BR23C uses Lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and have a higher energy concentration, which makes their lifespan longer than in the Lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, it’s the instinctive intelligent reaction that’s essential, not the processing of data, and even less the ability to store.
This mechanism should only process a few incoming signals per second, and react to them.
It is not necessary to store them and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers. In this way, it uses only a few dozen kilobytes of memory continuously.
There is no need for memory with a capacity of giga-bytes, or even mega-bytes.
This is the first step towards designing an instantaneous avoidance technology, according to Nissan’s estimates, this system will make its entry into mass-produced cars in the next ten years.
Another application could be its incorporation into the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to its destination by avoiding obstacles on its way.
We even gave the baby a name out of price
The written version of the <0x24>700 billion economic rescue plan, aimed at rescuing banks’ dubious credits, and to be used several times, is ready.
In the first round, half of that amount will be spent.
Reuters has announced that in the course of new debates extending until midnight, Saturday, the local time of the east coast, Congress leaders have agreed on the controversy that has existed for days and days, around the <0x24>700 billion bailout plan.
"We've made a serious step forward," Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic president of the U.S. House of Representatives, said, according to which there is nothing left but to put the agreements on paper.
The compromise, born from the plan, is supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said commenting on the results of the compromise that the program will work and be effective, but other measures still need to be implemented. According to Pelosi, it is not a question here of rescuing Wall Street, but of turning the wheels in the direction of the wheel.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of Asian markets, Sunday evening at 8:00 p.m., local time of Washington (i.e. Monday at 2:00 a.m., according to the local time of Central Europe), but did not cause a spectacular rise in the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote on the bill responding to the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, and then its fate will be in the hands of the Senate.
On Saturday evening, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, and then the White House also welcomed the news of the deal.
"We are pleased with the progress made tonight, and we strongly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and to protect our economy," said White House spokesman Tony Fratto.
In addition, the program differs from the initial proposal made by the Bush administration, which stated that the <0x24>700 billion should be spent at once, for the re-purchase of dubious credits.
From now on, a maximum of half of the sum of 700 billion can be spent. The first 250 billion will be issued immediately after the adoption of the law by Congress, probably on Monday. This first sum will be used by the Secretary of the Treasury to buy additional <0x24>100 credits from the dubious discarded banks.
The program will be supervised by an independent body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also take part.
The expenditure of the second half of the 700 billion depends on a new Congressional decree.
Under the law, the Treasury Secretariat will be able to put in place a combined strategy: at the same time, it will be able to purchase dubious claims, securities on dubious mortgages and mortgages, as well as other types of "toxic" claims.
The department’s competent people have stated that purchases can take place as part of an auction, but also directly.
The rule gives the companies concerned the opportunity to take part in an insurance scheme, where the Treasury Secretariat guarantees the tools that cause concern, for which companies will have paid a premium equivalent to the foreseeable damages.
Henry Paulson said that the law provides the necessary tools to devote <0x24>700 billion to the urgent needs of the financial system, whether it is the vast re-purchase of dubious receivables, their insurance, or to avoid the risk of the system leading to the collapse of a major financial institution.
"We will take the necessary provisions, to be ready for the law, as soon as it is signed," he added.
On the other hand, bank managers who are in bad posture and awaiting state aid can expect their starting allowances, simply called the gold outer-Atlantic parachute, to be ceilingd by the government.
Salary ceilings are mentioned only in very specific cases, and the limitations depend on how the Treasury Secretariat offers its assistance to the company.
The principle of ceilinging means that if the Treasury secretariat buys back as part of an auction, they will collect a surplus tax on the golden parachute unless the discredited bank president retires.
Immediately after the repurchase of doubtful claims, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to the leaders is not exaggerated.
In order for the image to be complete, however, it is necessary to add that the existing golden parachutes are not modified. The ceiling concerns only new contracts, thus motivating participation in the plan.
This is the first time in U.S. history that legal ceilings will be in place regarding the appointments of CEOs, said Barney Frank, the chairman of the House of Representatives' financial services committee.
In addition, the State grants a right to acquire shares in banks taking part in the plan, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, since they may even be winning in the case as soon as the economy and with it the banks saved fall back on their legs.
The bill states that within the next five years, the President must submit to Congress a proposal that will determine how the losses will be reimbursed to taxpayers, from the financial sector.
On both sides, of course, there were those who expressed their doubts about this plan.
That’s not why American citizens mandated us, this doesn’t protect taxpayer dollars,” California Republican MP Darrell Issa said.
His Ohio Democrat colleague, Mary Kaptur, thinks they are the same ones who are pressing for action, as those responsible for the Wall Street collapse.
Industrial Prices Continued to Rise
In August 2008, domestic industrial sales prices increased by 0.1 per cent from the previous month, and by 12.9 per cent from August 2007, the Central Statistical Office of Hungary reported.
Industrial export sales prices increased by 1.1 per cent compared with those of July 2008, while compared to those of a year earlier, they decreased by 3.9 per cent.
As a result of fluctuations in domestic and export prices, industrial production prices increased by 0.7 per cent compared to the previous month, and by 3.2 per cent compared to the previous year.
Domestic industrial sales prices have only increased to a lesser extent: 0.1 per cent compared to the previous month.
Domestic sales prices in the manufacturing industry have only experienced a slight increase of 0.1 per cent compared to July.
In August 2008, the most significant price increase was observed in the leather and footwear manufacturing sector (2.8 per cent), with first the manufacture of bags and belts with a monthly increase of 4.6 per cent, then the production of footwear with a 2.5 per cent increase.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical raw materials has resulted in a significant monthly increase in prices in the manufacturing sector of chemicals and products (1.6 per cent).
This resulted in deflation in the oil processing sectors (1.4 per cent), the manufacture of electrical machinery and appliances (0.9 per cent), as well as a minimal increase in the wood processing sector (0.1 per cent).
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing activities have not changed.
The other sectors of the processing industry saw an increase of between 0.2 per cent and 0.9 per cent.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors, representing a significant weight in the national industrial operation, prices rose by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly due to the effect of the increase in the price of gas set up by the authorities since 1st July.
In a 12-month comparison, taking into account domestic sales of the processing sectors, the oil processing sector prices experienced the most significant increase (32.4 per cent).
In the metallurgical manufacturing sector, prices increased by 13.2 per cent, while in the major food, beverage and tobacco sector, prices increased by 11 per cent.
Price reductions occurred in the textile and textile production sectors (2.5 per cent), as well as in the manufacture of electrical machinery and appliances (0.3 per cent).
In the other sectors of the processing industry, price increases ranged from 0.6 per cent to 9.1 per cent.
Over the entire processing industry, prices have increased by 10.2 percent over the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors exceeded those of the previous year by 18.7 per cent.
Among the domestic trade groups and according to the sectoral allocation in August, the sectors initiating investment profits showed the most significant monthly price increases (0.7 per cent).
In the consumer goods production sectors, prices increased by 0.3 per cent, while those in the energy and materials-producing sectors for further processing did not change from the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month of the previous year, there was the largest increase in the energy and materials sectors for further transformation (16.8 per cent).
In the consumer goods production sectors, inflation was measured at 6.8 per cent, while for the profit-initiating sectors, a decrease of 1.4 per cent.
Industrial export prices in HUF increased by 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month, while they fell by 3.9 per cent over 12 months.
In one month, our national means of payment weakened by 1.7 per cent against the euro, and by 7.1 per cent against the dollar. Compared to August 2007, it increased by 7.5 per cent against the euro and by 15.9 per cent against the dollar.
Next year, will we still need a visa to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz thinks there is a good chance that around January 12, the U.S.-Hungarian visa-free agreement will come into force. This is what the Foreign Minister said in Chicago, before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
"Now, everything depends only on the moment when electronic input and control systems across the Atlantic will be put into operation," she said.
Every time, it has attracted attention to the fact that in the new system, there will be no entry visa, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The head of the Hungarian diplomacy will be in negotiations from today in Washington.
He will meet the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will hand over the decoration of the Commanding Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary, and will have an interview with the Obama foreign policy advisers of the candidates to the presidency, John Barain and the Democrat
Barack Obama and McCain Support Bank Rescue Plan
On Sunday, Barack Obama, along with John McCain, the candidates for the presidency of the two major U.S. parties, secured their support for the <0x24>700 billion government bailout plan, but there are politicians demanding the resignation of the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury.
After days and days of marathon negotiations, representatives in Congress and the Administration finally announced on Sunday morning that they had concluded principle agreements on the bailout plan of the banks.
This funding plan, aimed at decreasing the Wall Street crisis and the paralysed credit market, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain are even presenting themselves, each as more fit than the other, to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest polls, with the development of economic issues, Obama again managed to get a little ahead of himself. McCain's advance, obtained with the appointment of Sarah Palin as a waitress just after the Republican convention, melted.
At a campaign meeting in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope of seeing Congress quickly vote on the 700 billion-billion bailout bill.
He stressed that the proposal contains the passages of consumer protection that he also supports.
“It’s now that we need to act responsibly (...) a danger threatens your work, your economies, the entire industrial sectors and the stability of the whole economy,” he said before a crowd of 35,000 people.
McCain’s economic ideas have been described as past.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said: “We will all have trouble swallowing it (...) but doing nothing is not a possible way.”
The Republican senator said that the proposal referred to the creation of a Treasury Control Commission and the ceiling of the senior leaders' departure allowances, and that he was personally very attached to these points.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no background role in the negotiations, while he was in daily contact with the Treasury Secretary.
Nancy Pelosi, president of the House of Representatives, said on Sunday that there are serious hopes that the House will vote on the bill from Monday.
Press Release of the German Linguistic Territory
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only at the heart of the party that the voters have become more aware - this is how the Der Spiegel, the low score of the CSU in the Bavarian country, evokes.
Haider is ready to rule Austria, to prevent the coalition of the Reds and Blacks.
The Mirror (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the German left-wing information magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article entitled "The Bavaria Revolution devours its fathers".
According to this recognized political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took office.
Christian socialists have transformed Bavaria for decades and now they are the same modern citizens who turn their backs on them.
This change of times is at the same time the problem of all Christian democracy, and therefore also that of Angela Merker.
For the CSU, failure was not quite a surprise, but on Sunday, a process that was likely just ten years ago came to an end: the indisputable hegemony of the national party has ended.
That was ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU accumulated 47.7 percent, for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the 50 percent level.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, i.e. at the time of the so-called Stoiber.
The cause of this can be attributed to the modernization "devoring his parents", established in the region consistently by the CSU.
It has been 40 years since sociologists announced this, but they were very wrong about the rhythm, but the secularization, the results of the education and establishment of Germans of the north and east in the region of Bavaria, in full development, could not be left unfinished.
Modernisation will go hand in hand with increasing opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only within the party that voters have become more conscious, more critical, and more enthused.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks, it is precisely the groups of classical citizens who have rather distanced themselves from the CSU, such as independents, craftsmen, baccalaureates and graduates.
In these groups, support for CSU fell below 40 per cent.
The Press (diepresse.com)
In his article entitled "Who? With whom? The party presidents stand on the reserve in the face of the issues of the coalition", the conservative Austrian newspaper deals with the situation of the confused domestic policy that settled after the Austrian elections.
The Austrian Socialists of the SP<0xC3><0x96> want to discuss with the conservatives of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP prohibits SP<0xC3><0x96> from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BZ<0xC3><0x96> populist party is open to negotiations and the Greens do not want to agree on the coalition.
Elections took place, now all around the coalition; during public television debates, party leaders barely let their cards be interviewed.
Werner Faymann, the president of SP<0xC3><0x96>, confirmed that he would like to discuss with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to show that collaboration between the two parties is actually possible - that is what already exists in certain regions and in the socialist partnership.
The question that he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the <0xC3><0x96>VP, as vice chancellor, remains open from Faymann.
As he mentioned, the Schussel-Molterer orientation was, in any case, rejected.
A replica of this combination is unquestionable.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the proposals of the Reds.
As he has already said, collaboration will certainly be unsuccessful if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
In his party, the choice of the opposition or joining the coalition is for the time being a completely open question. These points must absolutely be debated within the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
Jörg Haider, the President of the BZ<0xC3><0x96>, is again open to all proposals.
“To avoid the coalition of the Red and Blacks, we are ready to take on government responsibilities,” Haider said.
Járóka said: We must break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation
Today, in Paris, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, hosted by France, has begun, as representative of the current Presidency of the European Union.
In her message before the plenary, as one of the main speakers of the expert consultation, Lívia Járóka, MEP Fidesz People's Party of Europe, drew attention to children's segregations in education, because this is a violation of the right to more Roma children, which is a violation of the principle.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened, on the one hand, by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and on the other, by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among those invited to participate in the consultation are the European social partners, as well as the most prominent representatives of legal protection and European civil bodies, in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the Fidesz People's Party group, Járóka warned that in addition to the distinctions found during the recruitment, the Roma disappear from the labour market, in the first place, as a result of their low qualifications.
"The overwhelming majority of young Roma do not have high school diplomas, and as a result of poor quality elementary education, only a small part has the possibility of obtaining a higher education degree."
In addition, Járóka stressed that education as an elementary right to human beings plays a key role in the promotion of other fundamental rights.
Investing in the early education of Roma children means strengthening the economy of the EU Member States.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these relations in the widest possible circle, including between Roma and non-Roma people.
Indeed, the sooner a Roma child starts school, the more likely it is to become a productive member of the labour market; by the taxes paid from his income and consumption, he participates in the state budget.
“By their nationality of the European Union, Roma must be assured of their right to quality education, and be protected from low-quality and sectarian education,” Lívia Járóka said.
In the view of the MEP, an objective and action-oriented cooperation of the European Union is necessary for the immediate acceleration of the process of desegregation of schools, for which compliance with existing anti-discrimination directives and in preparation is of paramount importance.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, and give Roma children the chances of democracy, so that they can participate as full citizens in the future of Europe," Yaróka said.
In the name of the "European Year for Equal Opportunities" for All, the objective of the Equal Opportunities Summit in Europe held every year since the Berlin Summit last year is to ensure a single platform to support the measures taken in favour of equal opportunities in Europe, at the level of the Member States and in the fight against crime.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
It is in October that the decision on the fate of the defunct duo Huber-Beckstein will be taken.
Despite this pitiful election failure, the heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues at the Bavaria CSU summit has been postponed.
The president of the party, Erwin Hube and the head of the regional government, Günther Beckstein, can still retain their place. The question is how long will grace last?
The fate of the tandem, having suffered a catastrophic vote loss of 17 percent, will be on the agenda of the Congress of the Extraordinary Party, held last weekend in October.
The members of this highly criticized pair have, at any rate, felt that they did not hold specially in their seat.
Thanks to this, they endeavored to calm the angry members of the faction and the base, who one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - it is true, still under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, at the top of his career - the socio-Christian union won 60.7 percent, while today, one year after the putsch against Stoiber, only 43.4 percent of their strength remains.
For 46 years, the CSU has been the "only sovereign" of Bavaria giving 18 percent of German GDP.
But the conservatives still have a lot of faith in this southern region, which is of key importance for the Hungarian economy, and in the future they will be forced into the coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal reorganization of the party, the vice-president and federal minister of agriculture, Horst Seehofer, presented as Huber's possible successor, also received a place in this modest group of recognition, which initiates discussions with the liberals, as well as with the liberals of the FD.
A strange foot of destiny was that with the help of the list of Free Electors, Gabriele Pauli entered the legislation, whose action against Stroiber served as a possibility of putsch perpetrated by the duo Huber-Beckstein, to then treat the very ambitious municipal politician without a household.
Now the CSU leaders are putting all their energy to stabilize, in one way or another, Beckstein.
In this transition, Stoiber, who so far was pulling the ropes behind the scenes, will also be actively involved. The former head of the regional government and former president of the CSU, designated September 28 as the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some sharp remarks to the CDU, saying they deserved much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and also to Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections, which will take place in September 2009, Merkel will only be able to be Chancellor again if they re-establish one way or another, with a common force, the CSU, which played an important role in the national success of 2005.
According to Merkel, barely hiding her disappointment caused by the fiasco, the CSU’s loss of land will not negatively affect Berlin’s major coalition.
This is relative, however, because it will not be easier to manage the injured CSU, and the Socio-Democratic crisis continues.
Since 1946, the SPD has achieved its worst results with 18.6 percent in Bavaria.
Lukasenko - his rivals : 110 - 0
No member of the opposition has joined the Belarusian parliament since Sunday's elections.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by a country led by Alexander Lukashenko, which ensures prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), it is explained by illegalities committed during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
Although the legislature of 110 people in this country of 10 million times has been running very well for decades, before yesterday's elections, the opposition uniting its forces under the name of United Democratic Forces (United Forces, ODSZ) would seriously hoped that the predecessor, Lukashenko's new mandate, would change the constitution.
In this way, the ODSZ renounced its originally planned boycott.
The fact that Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, would like to improve its relations with the EU, where, because of the Belarusian political order qualified as anti-democratic, Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians are not contributing to the mainstreaming of the Russians, the cause of the more credit, was the nature of the Biethers.
The fact that the OSCE, when assessing the campaign, focused on positive changes rather than flaws, such as the ban on a third of opposition candidates, referred to a prior relaxation.
However, the OSCE statement on Monday already contested the campaign, during which most of the opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and in particular the fact that the opposition could not be present during the counting of votes.
Despite all this, the opposition still feels a tangible improvement in the political regime: political detainees have regained their freedom, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, always refusing to recognize both South Ossetia and Abazizia, separated from the Russians, who are part of the Georgie.
"We have taken two steps forward and one step backwards, but most importantly, the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has been initiated," Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the candidate for the opposition in the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that this remain so, despite the fact that "power has been afraid in this parliament that has no weight, to bring even one opponent in."
The opposition does not envisage protests in the light of the results, but rather seeks to bring its message about the need for economic reforms to the electorate.
"Of course, we have a lot of concerns from this main side: we really need to print our opposing newspapers in Russia, the local authorities are putting us sticks in the wheels in terms of the retransmission, but I can see that they are also more and more formally to support the elections, more and more socially, as they do, even in the circle of people âg.
"Due to the country's debt and the rising trade deficit, the collapse of social security, 'evoking the silence of a cemetery', is only a matter of time," said Milinkevitch.
Unlike opposition politicians, Russian observers have called the elections a democratic one.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the Mission of the Community of Independent States, told Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words, but in acts." In this way, the absence of opposition is only proof of the maturity of the electorate.
Brunetta: "From today, breakfast before work".
Never, in the history of the Chigi Palace, had we had no turning doors for the entry and exit of employees.
But from today onwards, this new measure is in force against the little males, against whom it aims and then goes to drink the coffee at the bar during working hours.
The anti-fraud news was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary-General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
“The turning doors – says Brunetta – are an instrument for better work, with more productivity, more presences and more services,” the minister said.
Now begins a new season of responsibility and transparency.
“It’s about reformism,” Brunetta added.
The installation in all establishments of the Presidency of the Council is complemented by the Palais Chigi.
According to Masi, "the choice of turning doors is important even from a symbolic point of view.
No resistance on the part of employees has been recorded, the Secretary-General assures: “This is a process shared by employees, and we have had everyone’s collaboration.”
In short, more breakfast during working hours; more coffee or croissant.
Brunetta's promise, which suggests smiling, "a good cappuccino at 7 a.m. is an excellent and healthy resolution."
During a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
“In three months, the absence of disease of public employees has decreased by 50%, or 60,000 more workers in a year.”
And he adds that it is essential to make the Public Administration more effective.
Italy, "of which the salary dynamics - the minister explains - have doubled over the last 8-10 years compared to the private sector, and well beyond inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees joined forces to challenge the standards of the Brunetta decree using the Codacons.
"While the Minister of the Public Service is today reporting data on the decrease in absenteeism in the workplace due to disease-written by the association of consumers-the people of "active taxpayers" continues to increase.
Indeed, in Italy, thousands of correct and productive public administration employees have come together to declare war on the illegitimate standards contained in the decree.
In particular, in the Tar, the exclusion of additional allocations in the event of illness due to service is contested; the extension of the hours of residence of the sick worker, during which the inspection visits are carried out, as well as other aspects contained in the new provisions desired by the Minister.
Workplace Accidents, Napolitano: "Crucial Prevention"
Every day in Italy, there are 2,500 work accidents, 3 deaths and 27 persons who remain permanently disabled.
In 2007, Inail data confirmed that white deaths were about 1,200.
Figures testify to the severity of the phenomenon, which remains one of the leading causes of death, and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To draw the attention of the institutions, social forces and the media on this dramatic aspect, the Anmil celebrates today, in all Italian provinces, the 58th National Day of Accident Victims at Work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data circulated by the Anmil, as well as the tragic events of the last few days, confirm the importance of the topic of prevention in the workplace," said the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the President of the Anmil, the National Association of Workers of the Intl.
The Head of State expresses his "sincere appreciation for the ongoing associative effort in favour of prevention in the workplace, the protection of accident workers, the assistance to the families of the victims and the awareness raising of the public opinion."
"Naturally indignant, everyone has hit the punch to put an end to such tragedies that, by their dimension, spark the screaming of the media and the participation of public opinion, even though the daily reality presents us with dramatic cases, even repetitive in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that "there is certainly a problem of resources: it is essential to invest in training and information"
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector are of particular importance for a more direct awareness of young people entering the world of work.
It is our duty to keep an eye on this phenomenon, not to underestimate the alarm on social gravity, to apply and improve legislative standards.
The President of the House, Gianfranco Fini, stressed how "this phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social urgency, which insults the conscience of each of us, and imposes upon all institutions, a concrete effort to put an end to it quickly".
The data from the accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not prevent the number of white deaths from being impressive anyway,” said Anmil Pietro Mercandelli, president of the company.
“We do not want this ‘discount trend’ to actually translate into a minor attention, because it is precisely when the attention relaxes, that tragedy happens.
"We believe that in general, we do not do enough to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be made through multiple actions."
“We believe that more controls and inspections are needed, as are more important interventions on the training of workers, and this, from school.”
- He added - "there is still an effort to be made in terms of communication and public awareness.
“But above all, there is a greater sense of responsibility from employers in the face of a phenomenon that represents a social urgency.”
Mercandelli then denounced "the gradual deterioration of the conditions of safeguarding compensation for the victims of labour" and "the support derivative towards which the system has been oriented in recent years".
“The goal, therefore, is to give back to the worker the insurance guarantee so that the fate of the person who has an accident does not depend on the spontaneity or enlargement of the legislature.”
Mp3 player pointed to the finger, they put the hearing at risk.
Listening to full-volume music for an extended period of time using portable music devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
This is what the European Commission, in a statement published in Brussels, cited the opinion of the Scientific Committee on the Unforeseen and Recently Identified Health Risks (Csrseri) of the EU, published today.
“In this scientific report we read in the note, it appears that 5-10% of those who, over a period of at least 5 years, listen to full-volume music using portable musical devices, for more than an hour a day and a week, are at risk of permanent hearing loss.”
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and full-volume mobile phones can unconsciously damage their hearing irreparably," says Meglena Kuneva.
"According to the scientific data, this is a clear risk and we need to react quickly.
What matters most is to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
We must also review existing control systems in the light of scientific opinion, so that they are fully effective and can track new technologies."
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to consider the problem, given the intensive use of portable musical instruments and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise they generate.
"Scientists-concluding the EU-executive apparatus-confirm that there are good reasons to be concerned, and that the European Commission will now consider with the Member States and other stakeholders, what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children's and teenagers' apparatus, whether they are musicians or musicians, if they are proving to be loud at the ex-workshop.
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100Db, but there is increasing concern about hearing damage that could result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit this data well by using solutions such as reducing levels and duration of noise exposure.
The EU Scientific Committee notes that users of portable music devices, who listen to music at full volume (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours a week, are exceeding the current limits for the maximum noise level agreed at the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for prolonged periods of time are at risk of permanent hearing loss after 5 years.
This concerns 5-10% of users of these devices, and their number can be quantified to about 2.5 and 10 million people in the U.S.
Rome, Alemanno gave the order to leave the Commission for the future of the capital.
Today we start, in March we finish, in June we will draw the sums.
This is the timetable set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capitale", which took place this morning, at the new headquarters, behind the Thermes of Caracalla.
Within six months, President Antonio Marzano and the 49 other members of the Commission will develop the guidelines for Rome.
In March, when they are completed, the Committee and the Municipal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects, in order to present in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official timing" of the Capitol and its Mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The commission is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented there - it will have to propose ideas for the development of Rome, which will be used by political decision makers, who remain the Committee and the Council of Communes.
No superposition of roles, but only the will to have a corner where to develop a great project for Rome.
In March, it will complete its tasks and then disappear, as this experience must have a precise time duration.
In June, the mayor announced that we will present the strategic plan resulting from the work carried out by the Commission for the future of Rome Capitale.
For those who accuse the Commission of being useless, since its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replied: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do, as well as on the quality of its proposals.
If the quality is there, as in France, thanks to the Attali Commission, as in Rome, I am sure, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics is plagued by day-to-day management and emergencies that manifest from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to see ahead, and further, towards a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future."
In addition, the mayor of Rome wants to stress that "this Commission is not a useless body or bureaucratic set: it is absolutely free, and will not cost Roman citizens a euro, and will be used to study and bring to the attention of the best intelligences that express the Capital.
For Alemanno, in fact, "we need a strategic reference draft, neither firm nor immovable, in order to allow our city to improve, what it absolutely needs, while thinking about its future now a unified spirit," he said.
A future which, according to the mayor of Rome, "will not be limited to the usual communal borders, but which will look further" not only from the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital, but "also in relation to the role that Rome can and must have, as Capital of Europe and the Middle East."
Obama? The first anti-American president. That's why.
A famous American politician who wants to pass as an independent, wrote: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, on his part, destroyed the U.S. economy and had relations (as he still has today, as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam.
Attacks against Obama are increasing as the election date approaches.
A lady from Miami wrote on a website: “This person is full of ambition.”
“Obama is really clumsy: he believes he will win the highest office of a nation that counts in all, two governors and five black senators!”
In fact, these are attacks that don’t say much; they are obviously racial attacks, and they don’t answer the question of all voters: Will he be a good president? We also have the polls, which all declare that Obama will win and with a good advantage.
In this case, it is still someone who speaks with the heart and not the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the south of the United States, wrote an article: Once in the voting booth, we know who the American patriot will vote for.
This is what emerges from an aspect of the American mentality kept secret until the end.
“Say whatever you want, we’ll see ourselves putting the cross on Obama or McCain.
There are even people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave the United States.
Things never revealed so far, to such an extent that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
Anyway, despite all these reasonings, the winning card for Democrats is George Bush.
We asked 1,500 people: What were the mistakes Bush made during his tenure? 89 percent answered: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, the nation lost 50 miles of troops and was sent back home with a kick in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans were not forced to pack their bags.
Despite this, Iraq was, for the most part, Bush’s weakness.
Whoever takes the place of George W will have a huge task to accomplish.
In the United States, the economic downturn is felt even by journalists: in the press, it is the time of the suppression. And many accuse the Internet, this "assassin" of the newspaper paper.
Five hundred American journalists have been interviewed by the PEW Research Center about the status of their profession and mental control for the future.
Almost all journalists today are pessimistic about their future.
However, they have not openly stated to the information attachments, feeling less concerned about the credibility.
They don’t feel as isolated as they used to be.
The problem with American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a devastated economic model crisis.
In addition, the deletions done in the newsroom, in the room where editors work at the newspaper assembly, are a major problem.
This is a problem that needs to be resolved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism as the general public hears it, is not to be reduced accordingly.
An obvious but complex pessimism invades American journalism.
Six out of ten senior executives and press journalists are convinced that national journalism is on the wrong track.
Locally, the executive group is 65%.
Printed publication against broadcast.
Journalists don’t have a hard time seeing where the web is going.
The largest publishing houses are smashing a passage to the Internet, seen by many as the "assassin" of the newspaper paper.
The “economic pressure” that journalists feel is up to 79 percent.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to using technology in the hope that it would “do something good” for their journalism.
Today, the biggest accumulation in American journalism lies among those who run the newsrooms—i.e. the directors—and the reporters who work for them.
56% of executives at the national level are convinced that reporters share their values, while at the local level, this percentage drops to 23%.
For some, this is related to the “security of work”.
Directors who think they will lose their job within 3 years are 47% nationally.
As far as journalists are concerned, we go to 30%.
The one of "safe work" at the staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, television, and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and this quickly becomes a matter of taking or leaving.
Directors almost always get big salaries, while the editor can earn <0x24>10,000 a month, in addition to retirement and insurance payments.
As for the holidays, the logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days in total, spent a number of years.
But, according to their revelations, American journalists are often “diseased” during the year.
It's the climate's fault.
UNIPOL:TRIBUNAL ROME, DANILO COPPOLA RESTE A GROTTAFERRATA.
The president of the second criminal section of the Rome court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the case of the real estate agent, Danilo Coppola, who had requested to be able to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for a home in Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy as part of the Unipol-Bnl escalation instruction.
During the trial to his charge last week, he had been released from prison to become a mandatory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked the real estate agent to travel from the province city to a residence in the capital.
According to the court, such displacements (which the PM has not granted) would allow him to influence his company and have access to the evidence that accuses him.
Elites in danger.
The phenomenon had already emerged a few days ago, with the vote of the House of Representatives, contrary to the <0x24>700 billion bailout plan approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans were, and are even more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving it.
And it is the New York Times of yesterday that confirms it by communicating that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, even more shared between its old East Coast soul, moderate, favourable to the federal institutions as well as to the business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to those of the Centre and the finances of the world.
The soul, precisely, that made itself feel despotic with the vote I was talking to you at the beginning.
However, what has just been cited is just an example of the changes, the major changes that the ongoing economic earthquake is pre-announced or already lets go: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and may not be just here.
In the United States as in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the phenomena that have been covered for some time, to such an extent that, in the new climate, they solidify and manifest themselves.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the extraordinary revival, of the double category of state-sovereign, compared to some sort of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis is indeed a crisis of banking and financial institutions which obviously have close relations with abroad, but which, above all, are involved on a large scale, the balance sheets of people and families living in one country, in one state.
This immediately creates a political problem for the government: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families who are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically global but politically, it is almost only national.
Political internationalisation seems really out of play, or it has little to say: the obvious evidence is provided to us by the European Union, which, as usual, shares between the various interests and between the various national strategies, cannot decide on any common policy line.
And so it is from the government of each state that everyone is waiting for interventions, rescue and relaunch plans, new rules, and above all a credit affection: when you go through a difficult period, there are only States that have the economic resources, the mass of financial resources that are able to try them again.
They also have the necessary means and legitimacy to use them: two resources of invaluable value, elements that no market or international organization will ever be able to have in a similar way.
This new emphasis on the nation-state crisis is, of course, in perfect harmony with the ever-increasing importance that the recent economic developments of the economy tend to attribute to a factor quite related to this element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, indeed, while we were convinced that we were now entering the kingdom of the network, of ever more sophisticated technology, of the non-material, convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we have always realized that we will, with more and more of a single blow, be able to control the world.
Things that can certainly be transported from one place to another from the earth, but which are absolutely related to a limited space, to a territory.
Thus, the sovereign certainly possesses more cards than the one who is not, that is, the one who has the misfortune to live in a place without harvest, without oil and without water.
I’m now getting to the second novelty that, however, provides for a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, the search for a person who knows how to handle the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leaderships, economic species that turned out to be inadequate and full of shadow zone.
And in addition, something even deeper, in some sense, even troubling: a discredit, a suffering, a picture of inadequacy, a feeling of distance that tends to involve the whole class of directors in a growing number of Western countries.
Thus the conviction of the various classes, before the actions are the same ideas of the social elites until now at their peak, their way of listening and being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, to have the same time, and to be increasingly foreign to the opinions of the majority.
In short, the demand for leadership, in a subterranean way, feeds a powerful and ramified movement of delegitimations of the ruling classes and traditional political orders, which manifest themselves in the "revolts" of the elections, or in the changes of the collective moods of the latter, in the right of the Italians to the Bavaria to the Bavaria to the Bavaria to the Bavaria, against the Bavaria to the Bavaria.
It seems that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, they seem to have ever more difficulty, which does not date today, to comprehend and therefore represent the economic growth of the deeper and deeper layers of society.
In view of all this, speaking of a current "rebellion of the masses" on the agenda, it seems frankly exaggerated.
But it is said, to keep your eyes wide open, it is not without reason.
The super glue to walk on the walls.
Win the laws of gravity with a super glue and, in the future, walk on the walls like Spiderman.
This is the goal of various American research centers, and today, a team of four institutes has almost succeeded in doing so.
With an adhesive measuring just 2.5 square centimeters, the researchers managed to keep a body of 100 kilograms glued to a vertical wall.
The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is an evolution of those we know that use a particular carbon structure, called nano carbon tubes.
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a pile of spaghetti," explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of the geckos, covered with microscopic hair that ensure the animal, a perfect adherent.
Tests carried out on various materials, such as glass, teflon, and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles, and at the same time, that it “separates itself easily from the wall,” explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of California.
“This material could be used as a temporary adhesive,” adds Liming Dai.
Could it be to walk on walls like Spiderman? Maybe it is, but researchers are thinking of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, since nanocarbon tubes are conductive of heat and electric current.
Other applications could be related to aerospace engineering.
At the moment, no superhero.
The University of Berkeley, California, is also dedicated to the search for a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society, California researchers presented a microfiber-like hair-shaped adhesive, which self-cleanses dust while moving on a surface to ensure perfect and constant adherence.
Medications: Never with fruit juices.
Attention to pumpkin, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, especially consumed in the summer because deodorant and high in vitamins, if combined with certain vital medications, alter their absorption, amplifiing or decreasing depending on the case, their effectiveness, with even serious health consequences.
David Nailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risks of healthy fruit juices, whether in cans or fresh, if associated with the ingestion of certain medications; during the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society, they put together, one of them in Philadelphia, one of them, and one of them, a few others.
Pomegranate juice has already been strongly criticized as it is considered responsible for increasing the effects of certain anti-arrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, anti-staminal and neurological drugs, up to toxic levels.
It is the Italian Medicines Agency itself, which gave the news in a two-year newsletter, warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger of this mixture and to pay attention to what you drink, if you take Diapa or medicaments such as Mezza, for example.
PAMPLEMOUSE- According to experts, even orange and apple juice contains substances that inhibit medications.
Long is the list of active ingredients inhibited by pumpkin and other juices.
Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology at the Public University of Milan, said: "These findings are in general, immediately reported to the various national and international drug agencies that will need to change the informational notes of the drugs.
“You should always read the illustrative papers of the medicines you are taking, and, if something is not clear, do not be impressed, but clearly address the doctor or pharmacist,” the expert said.
The Nobel Prize in Economics to Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his research on business models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a New-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is also a famous New York Times editor.
Krugman is one of the top critics of the Bush administration's foreign policy and economic solutions.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, during the days of Enron's bankruptcy, Krugman had written, in an article published in the New York Times, that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on U.S. history.
A prediction that sparked many controversies, and that was blamed to the economist for years, but now turned out to be accurate.
"I'm surprised and even a little shocked at the speed with which the memory of scandals like the collapse of Enron or Worldcom has vanished from the public's attention," Krugman said in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "high-value economist" but also a very aggressive, particularly critical disclosure of the Bush administration's excesses of liberalism.
Open Office, this is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org.3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
Following a work of almost a year, carried out by volunteer developers, supervised by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package is shown to the general public with various innovations: from the welcome screen, and the interface that has been reviewed and became less austere, to other new formats, such as the latest version of the OS, the standard version for the OS, and the standard version for the DoOD.
Open Office has paid particular attention to the interaction with the Office 2007 suite, and it is indeed possible to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
Also interesting, some specific functions for certain modules, such as the one that reduces the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example, to send them by email, or to import PDF files into the graphical development module, while preserving the original appearance of the page.
Always on this front, it is possible to create "hybrid PDF" documents that combine the typical Adobe format graphics with the elements of a spreadsheet or text editor.
Collaboration between multiple people is an element that has had various improvements within applications: in the spreadsheet, various users can intervene, avoiding conflicts on changes, in the drafting of texts, because each employee is assigned a color of comments for better recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are even working to bring certain OpenOffice features to the web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks, they are expected to deliver the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://en.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.htmllet and adds to the English version that has been on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is as usual available in addition, for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can be shipped at home or at work.
And if the theme of free will can be a way to spread it in homes, it’s just in business, that Open Office is trying the big challenge, already able to count on various projects carried out in public administration and schools.
Notwithstanding the realities that offer training, consultation and assistance services, ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could also open up to business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the equivalent writing video of Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for the rival PowerPoint presentations;Dbase, such as the famous Access, is the program that allows you to work on the databases; finally, Drwa is the graphic module.
The target for 2008, reaching 5 million downloads, and considering that today there are almost 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, you can even exceed the expected figure
Kohl is also positive, this is the fourth case of doping.
New case of positivity in the last Tour de France: this is the Austrian team Gerolsteiner, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the top climber's shirt.
It is the website of the daily L'Equipe that reports the news.
At the age of 26, Kohl is the fourth positive cyclist in the Cera, the third generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Ricco and Leonardo Piepoli, and the German Stefan Schumacher, also of Gerolsteiner.
The blood tests on Kohl samples are part of those carried out in recent weeks by the Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the counter-analysis confirms the positivity at Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place in the Tour and will have to forcibly expect two years of elimination.
The news of Kohl’s positivity at the third-generation Epo was confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who informed the Associated Press that he had notified the Austrian authorities of the positivity.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, thereby sweeping the top climber’s beaded shirt.
IMMIGRES: NEW YORK TIMES ASKED If ITALY IS racist?
Italy "as an immigrant country has recently turned into a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with reluctance.
Would it turn the Beautiful Country into a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times is interested in, which dedicated a long article on the topic of racism in Italy, starting with the case of young Abdul William Guibre, from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan, for stealing a box of biscuits.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the "Northern Paradox": the Nordic regions are both the ones where "more integration and more work" is recorded, but also "the country's strongest anti-immigrant sentiment and the most important support for the Northern League."
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also referred to the intolerance episodes of Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only.
Even the new legislation that the Lega wants to slow immigration and facilitate the expulsion of clandestine people is cited as evidence of climate change in Italy.
The Pope and the President of the Republic stressed the trend: "Giorgio Napolitano, during his meeting with Benedict XVI at the Quirinal, asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism."
Students victims of expensive rentals, up to 900 euros for a room.
The student rental market is not in crisis.
According to the latest Sunia survey, the union of tenants, renting a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects to the point of excluding entire categories of young people, from the right to study because of the very high overall costs that families from whom they have to support, explained the head of the study office of Sunia, Laura Mariani, who asked for the general training of the students in these cities, to process the
In most cases, rental offers also involve a series of violations: free contracts, unregistered, no rental limits, sub-leases.
For the Sunia, extraordinary interventions through the revision of taxation are needed to calm prices.
Reading the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room, you go from a minimum of 650 euros (Black Band area), to an average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine, and Fiera area) to a maximum of 900 euros (Victoria area)
In Florence, a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, a room about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in areas close to the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a bed in a double, and 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, in the vicinity of central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), about 600 euros are requested for a single, 450 for a bed in a double.
Slightly lower values (550 euros for a single) for areas close to other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You can save only if you go away in the peripheral areas: 300 euros for a bed, and 450 for a single in the Predestina, Centocelle area or similar.
In Naples, it takes 300/400 euros for a bed, for a single one, 400-600 euros, with higher prices in the Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari, for a bed, you have to count 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they are of major importance in the city economy.
Finally, cities such as Perugia, in which rentals are often taken by non-community students, there is a further anomaly: the rent requested for foreign students is increased by 25/30% compared to that applied for Italians.
Farewell old cinema Paradiso, cities feed the historic rooms.
Historic cinemas are closing in favor of the Multiplex.
“A city without cinemas is a blind city, it’s like a face without eyes.”
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore, illustrates well what is happening in the great Italian urban centers, but also in the cities of the province,
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth on the periphery of large multi-salles, and the death of consumption of mono-salles in the central areas of cities, is one of the major events that seems inevitable and indisputable to us; in addition, it has all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear, these are often places of history and loaded with memory, "it is as if one of my friends disappeared, someone we know, with whom we have shared a bit of a path and so much emotion" Can'ta always observes the director of the Nuovo cinema, of which he offers the film "Grand Paradiso", which is to
The figures provided by Anec, the main trader’s association, mean everything: in the last five years, 316 traditional-type cinemas have closed, and it is the rooms of the main cities that have paid the most for it: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin.
Among the regions most affected by the closure, Emilia Romaine is at the forefront with 82 cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
The evidence confirms that the first cause of their disappearance is the arrival of the multiplex, as it is well the three Italian regions that have recorded the most new multi-room cinemas: 195 additional screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany as well as in Emilia-Romagna.
"Italian exploitation has developed irrationally," observes Paolo Protti, president of Anec, "it is useful to build new structures, but it would still have to guarantee the survival of those already existing, because when a farm room in a city, these frequencies are not necessarily available to everyone.
Not to mention the lack of deliberation on credit in favor of traders: the state’s previous debt is about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million.
It is shameful that, from an ethical and moral point of view, the Government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector, it would take between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16 million and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>18 million a year.
Note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, concerned about these closures, decided to solve the situation by signing a protocol between the City Hall and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to defend and promote the cinemas mono rooms of the historic centres and in the outskirts.
Among the regulations envisaged, there are tax facilities for managers and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: viewers will be able to enter the restricted traffic area, and will have special rates for parking lots and in certain parking lots.
"This is an initiative that I like," observes Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna and put in place other measures.
However, it is obvious that in order to contrast the superpower of multiplexes, traditional rooms must also improve the quality of sound and image, as today’s audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Bagheria Supercinema, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New Paradiso cinema" that I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass by the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale, now closed, where I have lived so much shared emotions, I turn to the other side not to see the black panels through the dust.
Links between politics and ‘drangheta, detained mayor of Gioia Tauro.
“The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to uniformize the choices of the City Hall in the interests of the Piromalli clan.”
Heavy accusations are made by the judges of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabre, towards Gioia Tauro Mayor and Deputy Mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and Mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition for Mafia Association.
The handles are also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and public administrations, and his little son lawyer, the boss's name, already convicted of association of mob-type criminals, as well as to pay <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million.
"An affront to legal and moral regulations, and above all of common sense," the prosecutors wrote, the two local administrations had expressed a willingness to pay consultations to Master Piromalli.
"So it would have been granted to the clan - write the judges - to officially enter the town halls facilitating the already considerable possibilities of control and guidance of the public administration."
The chairman of the Calabrian regional committee, Agazio Loiero, does not hide only "collusions between local committees and organized crime, there are more than one" in his region: "there are places where the mafia intensity is stronger than in other places, where the collision is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who resist the pressures of the ndrangheta, heroes who are honest.”
The arrests this morning follow those of last July, after which the police announced that they had decapitated the Piromalli clan.
By the end of April last year, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been disbanded; already in 1991, and still due to alleged conditions between organized crime and the local administration, local politicians had been discharged from their function of administering the City.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of the dissolution, had been appointed head of a centre-right coalition, following the May 2006 ballot.
He shouted at the scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He accused the deputy interior minister at the time, Marco Minniti, who accused him of manipulating everything for a political issue, but in view of the incarceration request signed this morning, the judges explained that the Piromalli clan had even managed to request the variation of the A3 project.
Starting from interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, the PM writes, emerged "the willingness to marry the demands of a businessman, representing a more well-known group, close to the Piromalli, uniformizing the choices of the public administration to the clan's interests.
When the energy is born of waves, now the big ones are launching.
This is a measurable landfill that occupies more than 70% of the planet’s surface and now the big global energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, currents, tides, these are the new renewable sources on which colossus like Chevron have put their eyes, and now they are trying to put their hands on it.
The possibility of obtaining energy from sea movements has been studied for hundreds of years now, and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the price of oil fell, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now the ecological instances and the new increase in oil give a big boost to the sector
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15% of the world’s electricity needs could be covered by sea wave operating systems.
That would be twice as much as nuclear power plants produce.
And in addition, there would be the currents and tides.
Colosses at the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a facility in the north of Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, it would have been said a real non-revolutionary one.
Two years after that, more and more candidates among these companies dedicated to traditional energy always rely on marine energy.
“Chevron is currently studying ocean energy technologies,” said a spokesman for a company associated with the U.S. oil colossal, the Wall Street Journal, “and is evaluating opportunities to cooperate with us.”
The cooperation in question concerns the obtaining of a license deliberately by the U.S. Energy Commission, necessary to give rise to a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially considering that it is in Alaska that the U.S. continues to extract oil, and recently President Bush has put in place a project for new excavations.
In addition to Chevron, there are Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey, which are travelling the way of energy coming from the sea, and the amounts invested to date, although their details are not known, according to observers, an increasing interest.
Technology to be developed.
Experts speak of a technology in its early stages, including the fact that marine energy does not dispel fears of ecological impact.
At present, systems such as those in Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small, and do not seem to create a major problem for the ecosystem.
In order to produce energy on a large scale, however, it is necessary to use technologies with a higher ecological impact.
And the choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of boulders connected to each other.
The push of the waves, which moves the mud up and down, is converted into a hydraulic pressure of the pistons and cylinders inside the floaters.
Pressure turns a turbine, which in turn powers a generator.
The energy is sent to the shore through submarine cables.
At the moment, we have four systems of this type in the project phase, pending a single federal approval, and some of the energy could be used for a military installation.
Greenant Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a shopping mall and a parking lot using six submarine turbines of the East River of New York.
The movement of water during tides makes the turbine poles rotate, creating a rotary movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant has announced to have a long list of customers awaiting the necessary permits to take power.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say at the Institute for Electrical Energy Research, deserves at the moment the potential of tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, tide is more predictable than wind, sun, or waves, and therefore more reliable as an energy source.
And it’s just about tidal energy that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others, have invested <0x24>7 and a half in 2008 and forecast investments up to <0x24>35 million in 2009.
